<p><span style="">Chapter 152 - Time to Clean Up #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">As he opened the door to the security room, men in black suits glared at him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An uninvited person suddenly entered so one person shouted nervously.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who? How did you come in here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reason for their panic was simple.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a place that absolutely couldn&#x2019;t be entered without permission, yet a person with a skull mask and leather jacket had entered this place unhindered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was suspicious, but didn&#x2019;t seem dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I have one jajangmyeon for delivery.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What, jajangmyeon? That would never happen, so get out of here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. As expected, it didn&#x2019;t work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the situation inside as he spoke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were around 30 guards in the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were those in charge of the VVIPs of large corporations.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why were so many security guards needed?</span></p><p><span style="">When he used &#x2018;Spying&#x2019;, the Hawk Eyes attribute automatically activated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could see the status window of the opponent with it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since he became King, he was able to recognize the weapons the opponents were carrying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hyu~ they also have guns.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There were real guns loaded with bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most guards these days were armed with toys, such as tasers or gas guns, yet the guards here were holding pistols.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, they were loaded with real bullets, rather than blanks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guards exuded the same aura of professionalism as a special forces trained unit.</span></p><p><span style="">The uproar at the entrance was so loud that the person who seemed to be the leader walked out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Why is it so noisy?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, here...a strange person came here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A strange person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He talked nonsense about delivering jajangmyeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader looked at Tae-hyuk with sharp eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Deliveryman?&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he wanted to pretend then he should&#x2019;ve at least brought an iron box.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t even seem like a hitman.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. Maknae. Show the guest out.&#x201D; (Maknae=the youngest person)</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader didn&#x2019;t know what this person&#x2019;s purpose was but he didn&#x2019;t want to make things bigger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Guest-nim. I don&#x2019;t know why you are here but it is over. Let&#x2019;s go now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A mixed martial arts fighter grabbed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s arm to drag him out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But there was something odd.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He touched something metal beneath the leather jacket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But strangely familiar...</span></p><p><span style="">The guard realized what it was and screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ack! What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This bastard has a gun!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a Colt M1911 and Beretta 92.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was common in movies to hold guns in both hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, those who used guns knew how hard it was to pull off.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the person didn&#x2019;t shoot properly then the accuracy was off and the wrist would be damaged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a toy like BB guns...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll tell you in advance that this isn&#x2019;t a model gun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha? So?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The other person obviously didn&#x2019;t know how to fire a gun properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The leader beckoned and the suited men pulled out guns.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Cheolkeok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The leader said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&#x2019;t a model.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, OK! The situation can&#x2019;t be resolved by talking to each other right? Okay, okay. Bullet Time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The skull masked man chanted something like a spell and fired his guns.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, what is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A few guards collapsed in an instant from holes in their heads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The leader of the guards realized the serious situation and shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-He has a real gun! Everybody take cover! There is only one opponent! If we remain calm then we can beat him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were elites in the security industry that were trained at the special forces level.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they struggled to deal with one intruder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the first place, this wasn&#x2019;t a suitable room to fight in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no place to hide their bodies properly.</span></p><p><span style="">In the meantime, the opponent was firing through gaps like they were targets at the shooting range.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why can&#x2019;t we take out someone who isn&#x2019;t even hiding?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then a guard behind a couch shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;S-Something is strange! How did this happen...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was natural for the guards to panic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponent was fighting with his body exposed but their bullets didn&#x2019;t hit him at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he knew where all of the attacks were coming from.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh! Ah, it can&apos;t be helped. Here I am!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the leader fired his gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He aimed at the opponent&#x2019;s chest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the skeleton masked person raised a hand to block the bullet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Puhaha! Fool! Do you think you can stop a bullet with your arm?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ting!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Then his mouth dropped open as he saw the bullet bounce off the skull masked person&#x2019;s arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The skull masked person grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I came here to sell a new arm. It is bulletproof.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">He was literally overwhelming.</span></p><p><span style="">The guards boasted significant shooting skills that couldn&#x2019;t be compared to the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was able to easily deal with them thanks to his upgraded crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is good that I modified the human body.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, Tae-hyuk had the body of a human.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Illegal Surgery evolved into Body Modification.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could freely use Machina, a machine arm, instead of his original arm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was forged to look like a human arm, but it was actually Machina, made from a superalloy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to the extent that it could block bullets.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But the damage to Machina is considerable. I should try to avoid bullets if at all possible.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As he looked at the guards, the Demon Revealing Mirror sent him a notification.</span></p><p><span style="">[Number of remaining guards: 14/31]</span></p><p><span style="">Then red dots appeared on the map, showing where the guards were currently located.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used Bullet Time to accelerate his mind and the bullet lines to see where the opponents were firing their guns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter the difference in numbers, it would be strange if Tae-hyuk lost.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If I knew this then I would&#x2019;ve come with a machine gun, not pistols. It feels good to shoot them one by one.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought as he fired at a guard who protruded his head from the table he was hiding behind.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Every time his gun fired, a guard collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bullets fired from the opponents were easy to block.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the number of guards reached 10, the opponents surrendered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t shoot! We will give you anything you want! J-Just spare our lives!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The screams of the shot bodyguards could be heard from around the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The leader of the guards was at a loss for words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A shootout was occurring in a building in the middle of the city.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. You seem to be the highest ranking one here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That&#x2019;s right!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader walked forward with both hands up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh. I wanted to kill a little more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He spoke like it was a game.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuheok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader moaned with a bitter expression. His precious men were killed or injured.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly walked closer and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where is Chairman Song Won-jin right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You are after Chairman...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just asked where Chairman Song Won-jin is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked as the leader didn&#x2019;t answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you remaining silent? Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He aimed his Beretta 92 pistol at the head of a man that was currently moaning on the ground</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will ask you once again. Where is Chairman Song Won-jin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What the hell is your identity...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should&#x2019;ve answered well. Why don&#x2019;t you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk fired at the head of another guard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a threatening shot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made sure to take the other person&#x2019;s life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I understand! I-I will answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader realized that he would be left until last and started to reveal what he knew.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... He was there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is everything I know. So the remaining people...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Did I make a promise to spare your lives?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shot towards the chest of the leader.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t even groan and died instantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This scammer! You said you would spare us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guards, who had been giving up, raised their guns and started their last hurrah.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the result was just like before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the dozens of guards collapsed around him and installed a bomb in a corner of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was someone who was still breathing but it didn&#x2019;t matter.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is small but it is enough to blow up the room. This will get rid of the bodies and evidence all at once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quickly left the security room and hit the detonator, causing the bomb to explode with a loud bang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was no longer interested as he looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. Interesting. This is how it works.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Find Chairman Song Won-jin and get information!]</span></p><p><span style="">A new message appeared on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The leader said that Chairman Song Won-jin was hiding in a hotel with a entertainment spot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then his next destination was decided.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to leave here before the people who heard the explosion came running.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked out onto the streets where the hot sun was shining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a bit unsettling that he didn&#x2019;t show any emotions after just killing dozens of people.</span></p><p><span style="">He had completely become a criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">A castle like structure was located not far from the city centre.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the J Hotel that only the peak of the political and economic world could enter.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the hotel was luxurious and had the finest entertainment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Tae-hyuk tried to enter, a security guard stopped him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This place is only for reserved guests.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Reserved? I made a reservation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pretended to pull something out from his pocket and hit the guard&#x2019;s head with his iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many people inside the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A gunshot would definitely be noticed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I should use Transformation so that I can enter peacefully. In fact, I should&#x2019;ve met the guards as Song Won-jin. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t sound sorry as he entered the hotel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A woman with a strange hair color approached him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Guest-nim! Welcome! Please let me know your reservation number and I will guide you there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She thought he was a normal guest because he passed through the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I just went to the convenience store for a while. I don&#x2019;t remember my room number.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had turned into Song Won-jin before passing through the front door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A security guard would have to show a pass, but customers were different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With this face, he had a free pass.</span></p><p><span style="">The female staff replied with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, could you tell me your membership number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, he didn&#x2019;t know that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">During this time, Song Won-jin&#x2019;s phone might ring.</span></p><p><span style="">Should he threaten her with a gun?&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he shot a few areas without killing her, then she would probably speak.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As he was thinking that, a man passed by.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, C-Chairman! When did you leave? I&#x2019;ll guide you back to your room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the nametag of the other person and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, Chief Kim. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! No. We are always working so that Chairman-nim can relax.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, he was a person who knew Song Won-jin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, Tae-hyuk was able to easily find the room where Song Won-jin was staying.</span></p><p><span style="">As he opened the door, hot air and strange moaning could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pant...! Pant pant! W-What? I didn&#x2019;t order room service.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin, who was gasping for breath above a woman, turned and looked at the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-Ack! W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was Chief Kim who reacted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two people with the same face looked at each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, one person stood with a cynical expression while the other person was lying on the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Chief Kim went through a lot of trouble. Please rest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He swung the iron pipe at Chief Kim&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he entered the room and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chairman Song, it has been a while. Ah, I shouldn&#x2019;t speak while looking like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and placed the skull mask on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a few things to ask you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kya, aaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The female who was with Song Won-jin screamed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk also hit her with the iron pipe and sat next to Song Won-jin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Will you tell me? We are close friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He took off the mask to reveal the face of Kim Tae-sung, the Bomber.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
