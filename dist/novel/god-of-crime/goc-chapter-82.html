<p>Chapter 82 - Phantom Opens His Eyes #4</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">20 people gathered in a large operating room, with more than half of them being Chinese.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were dark doctors belonging to the triad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They knew that a bomb was installed in T Medical Center so their expressions weren&#x2019;t so good.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bomb... Is it really installed here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard an explosion before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Crazy!&#x201D; (Chinese)</span></p><p><span style="">Various Chinese voices were heard in the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the meantime, the security guards, who were mostly Koreans, talked among each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we shoot them then will that guy spare our lives?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s just watch the situation. Still, surely he won&#x2019;t kill fellow Koreans.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The faces of the security guards were relaxed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like they thought the culprit couldn&#x2019;t kill fellow Koreans.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Beep!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A large monitor in the centre of the operating room turned on and a man wearing an opera mask appeared on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is the culprit that installed the bomb here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That bastard...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom bowed towards the people gathered in the operating room.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Hello.</span></i> <i><span style="">First of all, I will tell you two things.</span></i> <i><span style="">In 120 minutes, all the bombs installed in this building will explode.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;L-Listen! Aren&#x2019;t we both Koreans? Spare us, please!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Several guards grabbed the surveillance camera and started begging.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Phantom&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;d like to ask what made you so anxious.</span></i> <i><span style="">You don&#x2019;t have to worry, as</span></i> <i><span style="">I don&#x2019;t want to kill anyone.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Sighs of relief were heard.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Kukukuk.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&apos;m sorry but I am a liar.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then you will kill all of us...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Think about it slowly.</span></i> <i><span style="">I gathered all of you in order to play a game.</span></i> <i><span style="">The rules are very simple.</span></i> <i><span style="">In the meantime, you people have done this.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The screen switched to something hanging in the ledger room.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You should be familiar with this image.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">These are the prices for each body part on the black market.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">One heart is 130 million won.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">A kidney is 300 million.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">An eye is 170 million...</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Everyone who works here will see this list every day.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What game are we playing with it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yang Wei said that he would pay money if I spared his life.</span></i> <i><span style="">Does everybody agree with this?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Of course! I will pay however much you want, just please spare me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If they paid then they could live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people started begging Phantom again to spare their lives.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I want a sum of three billion.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guards slumped down at such a huge amount, but light filled the eyes of the doctors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could pay three billion won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rather, they felt that was cheap compared to the value of their lives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So far, they had cut apart hundreds of people and earned tens of billions of won in profit in a year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they thought about it, that was very affordable.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Of course, I won&#x2019;t receive it as money.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? T-Then what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-You should be very familiar with them.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me... Our body parts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You noticed pretty quickly.</span></i> <i><span style="">The rule is very simple and the time limit is two hours.</span></i> <i><span style="">In the meantime, use the things in this room to produce three billion won worth of products.</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course, it doesn&#x2019;t matter who it belongs to.</span></i> <i><span style="">For reference, they should be able to be implanted in others.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-It will be hard to make three billion won with the current international market value!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One doctor shrieked,</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I will give 10 million won for one arm or leg.</span></i> <i><span style="">Oh, don&#x2019;t you guys hate anesthesia?</span></i> <i><span style="">So I specifically removed all anesthesia from the room.</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course, the other tools are all intact so there won&#x2019;t be any problems with the surgery.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then, I hope you manage it.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Phantom turned off the monitor and there was an uproar in the operating room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Three billion won is ridiculous!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, ha, ha... A joke? Why are you looking...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Jump on that bastard! If we kill one person then 500 million won will come out. Then only three people need to die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They spread out and started trying to kill each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were those who tried to resist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Don&#x2019;t kill! If we die then surgery is impossible!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can take it out roughly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Obviously, Phantom had stated that it should be able to be transplanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they couldn&#x2019;t think of such things as madness filled their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">They had to kill others in order to live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yang Wei muttered to himself as he shot the head of a security guard trying to kill him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He obviously gave a choice to everyone. But eventually this will happen. Phantom... Really scary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">And the throat of Yang Wei was sliced with a doctor&#x2019;s scalpel.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recovered the bomb installed in the boiler room and muttered,</span></p><p>&quot;I would be crazy to use one more bomb.&#x201D;</p><p><span style="">In fact, he almost died using one to escape the guards underground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore he never intended to use this bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, let&apos;s see. There are two more left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One bomb was recovered safely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The last one had such tremendous destructive power that he didn&#x2019;t even bring it in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, there was one more condition for Doll Play.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Three billion won worth of organs and body parts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At least half of them had to give up their lives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if they didn&#x2019;t do anything and waited then everyone could live.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a hidden condition using the criminal&#x2019;s dilemma.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk called himself a liar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He only said one lie, which was that a bomb would go off two hours later.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If there was a good person among them then they might have noticed the trick.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered quietly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;ll pray for you. I hope you survive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the bomb in his bag and quietly left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A scream seemed to be heard from somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Son of a bitch... What type of human would do this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin safely escaped from hell and was able to receive treatment at the hospital.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, her arm had been cut off a week ago so it couldn&#x2019;t be helped.</span></p><p><span style="">After a few days, she was able to talk about the incident with Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Detective Cho Kang-suk, thank you for coming to see me. That is all I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-Yes... I&#x2019;m sorry that I had to ask you this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay. I know that it is a detective&#x2019;s job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s heart was burning.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the hard life that the child on this bed had lived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moreover, her life would be even harder in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But there was nothing that Kang-suk could do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All he could do was introduce a social worker whom he knew well.</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, he had to keep asking questions and reminding her of what happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time that he hated his job as a detective.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, he was called Phantom? He rescued you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Do you know the Phantom of the Opera? It&#x2019;s a musical that I went to see when I was at the orphanage. He wore the same mask as the protagonist.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;God of Crime...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t know his face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&apos;s okay. I&#x2019;m not disappointed. Well, that is it for today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk got up from his seat and Soo-bin desperately tried to stop him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she only had one arm so she fell back on the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can&#x2019;t you stay a bit more? I hate being alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Brat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk patted Soo-bin&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? The food here is delicious. Eat lunch before leaving.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it better for Hye-mi to eat the food?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Hye-mi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. She said she would die if she couldn&#x2019;t come visit now. I am going to pick up Hye-mi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-bin looked at Kang-suk with a touched expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was different from other detectives, and felt more like a dad than a detective.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ddrrrung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was a call from Kim Do-shik.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk left the room and spoke quietly so that Soo-bin couldn&#x2019;t hear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Inspector. I&#x2019;ve finished listening to the victim. I will write up the report later in the afternoon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Detective Cho.</span></i> <i><span style="">Is there a TV near you right now?</span></i> <i><span style="">Turn to ABS Station and watch.</span></i> <i><span style="">Crazy fucker.</span></i> <i><span style="">That bastard appeared.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The crazy bastard who is a criminal.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom appeared on TV?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t just ask questions, watch the TV!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A few days ago, Phantom announced the hippo case that they had been concealed from the public.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since then, the prosecutors had been searching for Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But a TV appearance?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, it was ABS Station that spread the truth of the hippo case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had said that Phantom threatened them with a bomb and it couldn&#x2019;t be helped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The clean-up from that situation still wasn&#x2019;t over.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Did you say Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin asked in a trembling voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Kang-suk had shouted so loudly that it entered Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The TV remote control... Ah, here it is! I&#x2019;ll play it right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A man wearing a Pandora mask appeared on TV.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pfff! What? That mask makes no sense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom made exaggerated gestures like it was a play.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">People.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">This is the whole story of the incident at T Medical Centre.</span></i> <i><span style="">They kidnapped weak children and took their lives. Therefore, I judged them.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;m sure you are all angry after hearing the horrible truth.</span></i> <i><span style="">Some people will think they died well.</span></i> <i><span style="">But don&apos;t forget.</span></i> <i><span style="">You are also an accomplice.</span></i> <i><span style="">100 children went missing, but was there even one person who cared about their disappearance?</span></i> <i><span style="">The missing reports were ignored.</span></i> <i><span style="">Rather, there were more people who were excited about their deaths because they could survive.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">This is the reality.</span></i> <i><span style="">Not one person tried to save the children, so I moved.</span></i> <i><span style="">I did it - I, Phantom.</span></i> <i><span style="">A criminal who judges other criminals!</span></i></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The video quickly spread throughout the country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The appearance of a horrible crime scene without a mosaic produced many controversies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Phantom&#x2019;s appearance in front of the public became the top story in the media for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho, the only journalist who Phantom contacted, received love calls from numerous media.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he had a contract with ABS Station and decided to honor it until the end.</span></p><p><span style="">The newly appointed police commissioner gave an order to everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Get that crazy criminal right now! It doesn&#x2019;t matter how much manpower has to be committed! God of Crime? Phantom? He might think of himself as a hero, but he is just a self-conscious child!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, the whole country was calling for Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No one knew the identity of the man wearing the opera mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The universities started practicing Phantom of the Opera, and more than 100,000 copies of the Phantom mask were sold in a day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Psychologists appeared on TV and talked about masks and personas.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were people who claimed that Phantom knocked on their doors.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom, the God of Crime, became the new trend.</span></p><p><span style="">What was Phantom doing now?&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was the only thing the country was interested in.</span></p><p><span style="">But Tae-hyuk was actually making tteokbokki in the kitchen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran invited Kim Soo-bin to their house to celebrate her discharge.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The food she wanted to eat was tteokbokki...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk had announced with a serious face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Seo Ha-ran also invited Song Hye-mi.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...By the way. Why haven&#x2019;t I received the reward yet? Is the Demon Revealing Mirror broken?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had roughly solved the case but there was no news about the rewards.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ding dong!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Brr!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There were two sounds at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk! Did you wait long? I was a bit late due to buying a cake!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran was carrying a cake box on the porch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was followed by Song Hye-mi and Kim Soo-bin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Excuse me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung has come! Eh? Tae-hyuk. Why are you looking like that? Don&#x2019;t you want to see Hyung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was acting like this due to the message that suddenly rose on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Doll Play mission has been accomplished.]</span></p><p><span style="">-10 blacklist points have been acquired.</span></p><p><span style="">-20 stat points have been acquired.</span></p><p><span style="">[All conditions are fulfilled and you can upgrade to &#x2018;Noble&#x2019;,]</span></p><p><span style="">- If you become a Noble, you can gain a wider variety of crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">-Some skills will evolve to a higher tier if the conditions are met.</span></p><p><span style="">[Do you want to upgrade to a Noble status?]</span></p><p><span style="">- Y/N</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly reached out his hand.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>[TL Note]&#xA0;</strong>Exciting news! <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Please read it here</a>.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
