<p><span style="">Chapter 83 - I am a Noble #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>[You have been promoted to Noble.]</p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Bomb Manufacturing has been learnt.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Torture has been learnt.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Illegal Surgery has been learnt.]</span></p><p><span style="">......</span></p><p><span style="">After Tae-hyuk was promoted to a Noble, notification messages constantly popped out in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were notices of crime skills that he had learned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The unpleasant fact was that they were all in the temporary skills window, and quickly disappeared like the salary of a worker.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Indeed, I couldn&#x2019;t learn it because of my rating.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked down at his body and sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, there was no apparent change.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of course. This isn&#x2019;t an online game where I become more handsome due to an upgrade.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been six months since he first got the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;When I think about it, many things have changed.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">After gaining the memories of the future, the first thing he did was catch Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even now, he couldn&#x2019;t help smiling as he recalled it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There had been many things since then, such as being involved in the cheating incident of a politician&#x2019;s son, as well as having his parents&#x2019; keepsake stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">He solved them using skills acquired from the other person and then he became stagnant for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now things had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Eh? One thing that I saw in the status window...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk... Sorry but please take this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk asked for help with the plastic bags full of food on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, it seems like he would have to look at the Demon Revealing Mirror later.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is <a href="www.google.com.au">soondae</a>, <a href="www.google.com.au">makguksu</a>... Why did you buy so much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... I bought food that is suitable to eat with tteokbokki.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran followed after him with a big smile.</span></p><p><span style="">They were ready to have a tteokbokki party.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah... This is a lot of food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the prepared food with his mouth wide open.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Far from making him hungry, it was such a huge amount that his stomach hurt at the thought of eating it all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin also muttered with an embarrassed expression,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think that even Alibaba and the 40 thieves could eat all of this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah. If we say Open Sesame, won&#x2019;t it all go into Detective Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s mouth?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Hye-mi spoke to Soo-bin like they were real sisters,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kukuku... If you don&#x2019;t eat then there won&#x2019;t be anything left for you!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk threatened with an open mouth, causing Kim Soo-bin to laugh.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, she seemed to have recovered to a certain extent from the Doll Play event.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, everyone please sit at the dining room table.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran finished setting out all of the food and beckoned towards the party.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin and Song Hye-mi were hungry from the cold winter and started eating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They consciously didn&#x2019;t say anything about Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s injury.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, the topic naturally turned to Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t know that the person who saved Unni would become so famous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He felt like a dark hero active in the darkness. All of a sudden, he appeared on TV...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk scratched his head and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom was wanted for bombing T Medical Centre and aiding in murder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was now a criminal, but Hye-mi and Soo-bin were treating Phantom like he was a superhero in a movie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same with the netizens on the Internet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fan sites for Phantom were growing like bamboo shoots in a bamboo forest.</span></p><p><span style="">He did all types of illegal acts, but it was true that he judged criminals that the police couldn&#x2019;t catch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a result, Kim Soo-bin and four children kept their lives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Plus...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, Kang-suk. Could you look at me for a moment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran wiped the tteokbokki sauce from Kang-suk&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a cry burst out from the side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Both of you, are the two of you dating? There is a suspicious atmosphere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hum hum... Anyway, Soo-bin. What do you plan to do with your donations?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk blushed and coughed a few times before saying uneasily,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That... I don&#x2019;t know. It still isn&#x2019;t mine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin benefited the most from Phantom appearing on TV.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She became a victim of the horrible incident, losing one arm and barely surviving.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, she was the first person that was saved by the dark hero, &#x2018;Phantom.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like the heroine of a movie had popped out in reality.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, Kim Soo-bin instantly became famous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A considerable amount of money was collected from all over the country for her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The sum was almost more than 500 million.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were even companies that started a scholarship foundation to support her university tuition and those who offered her a job.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was evident that they wanted to piggyback on Phantom&#x2019;s fame.</span></p><p><span style="">But to Kim Soo-bin, it was like a ray of hope had started to shine in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk hesitated for a moment before slowly opening his mouth,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you know that your father came to the hospital?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though the domestic violence caused the police to issue a restraining order, he was persistent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He claimed that he should be able to manage Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s money as she was his daughter and she was underage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Legally, he was Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s father.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he filed a lawsuit then the situation would become complicated.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Cho Kang-suk proposed a solution.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I was thinking. I will become your guardian and take care of you until you are an adult. H-H-How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stuttered out the last line.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin covered her mouth with her hands at the unexpected suggestion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Detective-nim? W-Why...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk explained his thoughts in a low, subdued voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a detective. It is my job to catch criminals, and also my mission to protect the citizens. But this time, I couldn&#x2019;t do anything. Phantom did what I should&#x2019;ve done. He is obviously a criminal that should be arrested. However, if he was in front of me right now then I would like to thank him. So, I wanted to do something that he couldn&#x2019;t do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were bugs after the money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After Seo Tae-hyuk got his first large amount of money, didn&#x2019;t moneylenders come after him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, Kim Soo-bin was a soft girl.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, the most important thing to me is Soo-bin&#x2019;s thoughts. Don&#x2019;t you become an adult in a few years? If you allow me then I will be your guardian until that time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-thank you Detective-nim...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t know about other adults, but she could believe Cho Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had supported the orphanage for several years already.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She also knew that he was the Santa who visited every year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such a man being her guardian...</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like she had acquired an army behind her.</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi, who was busy eating, spat out something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t Phantom calculate this when he came on TV?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me... Then that...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin recalled Phantom&#x2019;s last words.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Live.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin survived like he said.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, she found an unexpected guardian.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was all this Phantom&#x2019;s plan?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm? Did he say something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin told Kang-suk about her conversation with Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His eyes reddened without realizing it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn... He is a criminal, but he is a really great guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk listened to the conversation between Kim Soo-bin and Cho Kang-suk and realized that his plan was successful.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This will make Phantom a symbol.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was fighting to escape the fate of being framed and imprisoned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His weapons were his crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He walked alone while committing crimes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even without being framed, there was always a possibility of going to jail for the crimes he did commit.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the existence of Phantom the God of Crime emerged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a distinct symbol completely separate from Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the future, he would be able to do things more freely.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;In order to do that, I have to hide my identity more completely.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t enough to simply change his voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk saw new possibilities in his crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Evolution into a top skill...!</span></p><p><span style="">It was one of the best perks that Tae-hyuk received from becoming a Noble.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pressed on the details of the Voice Modulation skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then an explanation that he hadn&#x2019;t seen before emerged.</span></p><p><span style="">[If you satisfy the conditions, it will evolve into the top skill &#x2018;Disguise&#x2019;.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Disguise!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The name evidently meant that it was a skill to change his appearance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a skill that Tae-hyuk needed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It would be good if I could gain it for free.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was likely that a great deal of work was needed to obtain it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you allow me then I will be your guardian until that time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk almost spat out the tteokbokki he was eating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How much had he struggled to get Kang-suk and Ha-ran together.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What? Guardian?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he had guessed based on Kang-suk&#x2019;s character but he hadn&#x2019;t expected this offer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;N-Noona! Then Kang-suk hyung will come with a family. Is this the time to be looking with such a warm expression?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The time for dating seemed to be reduced even further.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">He should make Kim Soo-bin able to live alone as soon as possible for the sake of those two.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first thing to take care of was her arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, maybe it would be good to give her another arm?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In the early days, a mannequin arm that looked awkward would be used.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, technology was evolving and a number of smart robot technology was being actively researched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The replacement wouldn&#x2019;t be better than her original arm, but at least she could live a normal everyday life.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The problem is the price.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">So far, the technology wasn&#x2019;t commercialized.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a mechanical arm that didn&#x2019;t work well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then I can steal it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He also wondered if he could copy it with Forgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he could copy a number of robots then the utilization would increase.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is worth a try.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Kim Soo-bin like she was an experimental guinea pig.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh... I am also a student.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a short winter vacation, Tae-hyuk went to school and languished on his desk. Despite&#xA0;</span><span style="">his bad looks, the teacher&#x2019;s heavy hand disappeared after he became a model student.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But human nature didn&#x2019;t change that easily.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time he sat on his desk, a yawn would emerge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is Class President today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young wasn&#x2019;t sitting next to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was uncommon for her personality.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did something happen?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s send a message.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dururuk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young opened the door and entered with a joyful smile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She ran to Tae-hyuk to deliver the good news first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young approached Tae-hyuk and took deep breaths.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? You seem to be in a great mood. It was only a few weeks of holiday...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s not...I got into university.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I mean, I was admitted through special admissions. I did the entrance exam during the vacation because of the principal&#x2019;s recommendation. I got lucky and narrowly passed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Narrowly passed?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a clear pass.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Congratulations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;m sure my mother will be very happy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what university did you get into?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes. S Uni...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute. That is the best!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehehe... Yes, I was lucky.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A special admission to the nation&#x2019;s top university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was natural for An Eun-young, who studied so much that she got the studying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her effort paid off.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Didn&#x2019;t S University have one of the largest robotics research laboratories in Korea? If she passed then she will be allowed on a tour.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started plotting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young misunderstood his look and poked her fingers together.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-But don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t graduate early as I plan to go next year. T-The promise to go to university together is still valid...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s cheeks reddened at his answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Then... I am going to meet my mother after class today. Do you want to come along?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young then realized what she was saying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was almost like she was introducing a boyfriend to her parents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he had met her dad a few days ago but this was the first time meeting her mother.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young looked away from Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Tae-hyuk instantly welcomed this offer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t uncomfortable if they could take a tour of the university together.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young nodded vigorously.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
