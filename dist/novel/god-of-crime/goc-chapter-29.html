<p><span style="">Chapter 29: Power Deployment #6</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I will kill both of you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t shrink back an inch, despite there being a blade in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Try stabbing once. Have you ever killed anyone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">A strange madness could be felt in his laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur was overwhelmed and screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaagh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Use your fingertips to feel the other person&#x2019;s heartbeat and the feeling of it slowly disappearing. Realize the feeling of taking someone&#x2019;s life. Determination is needed to murder someone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Murder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the best and the worst crime.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had the memory of spending 10 years in a prison with the worst criminals in the country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had met with dozens of murderers.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, Tae-hyuk was able to know that the voyeur absolutely wasn&#x2019;t a killer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was merely an accidental murderer. </span></p><p><span style="">Could he really kill anyone from now on though?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could never swing the knife.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took a step closer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You aren&#x2019;t a murderer, so don&#x2019;t hold a knife!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur stepped back and his feet stepped on thin air.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a clear corridor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t really a corridor.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Flutter-</span></i></p><p><span style="">The paper hanging from the ceiling collapsed, as it couldn&#x2019;t withstand the weight of a human.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As it fell, a hidden staircase was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had hung a painting of a corridor right before a staircase.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur rolled down the staircase, collapsing on the ground as he lost consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would like it very much if you go to prison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recovered the painting he installed.</span></p><p><span style="">The place where the opponent fell was the plan B that he had prepared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, he put the operation, the one that he thought of ahead of time, into motion and succeeded perfectly.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk rubbed his cheeks with his hands as he felt his sweat flooding down the side of his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He inwardly sighed with relief.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m glad I didn&#x2019;t have to use plan C.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was to use Robbery to steal the opponent&#x2019;s weapon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike his other plans, that one had a high possibility of a struggle.&#xA0;It</span><span style="">&#xA0;was the one last bastion of self defence.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk reached out to Lee Hana who was sitting down with a blank expression.</span></p><p><span style="">She blinked a few times and regained her spirit as she held Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Did you draw this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was looking at the fake corridor that Tae-hyuk drew.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">She was definitely an artist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was more interested in the painting than the fact that the voyeur was caught.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I still have a long way to go. If you look more closely, then you will find out that it is fake. What does Hana sunbae think?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uhahat... Yes. It is really clumsy. However, I was still completely tricked. That, the voyeur... He was our school&#x2019;s assistant principal. He threw himself on the stairs. It is really perfect.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hah! A man like that was doing such dirty things...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, it is a relief. Even Hana sunbae was deceived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hana reached out to the voyeur who had lost consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, at first I thought he was going to kill you. Then, you got him to talk. I didn&#x2019;t know that he would be so frightened. Yes, yes. I have to praise you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha... He fell before I could stop him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hana smiled brightly, as if she hadn&#x2019;t just been threatened with a knife.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I sympathize with you. It is like when I have bad luck in front of handsome boys... Ahu!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A voyeur who knows the structure of this school... If this fact is known, then the media would be noisy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahaha... this school will become famous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It will just become notorious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well... If fact, I think there is one more case of mistaken identity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said to Lee Hana.&#xA0;</span><span style="">&quot;You are mistaken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought of you as an aspiring artist. But you&#x2019;re not, are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t answer Lee Hana&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">But she reached an answer anyway.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are a forgery specialist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed. </span><span style="">He realized that he couldn&#x2019;t deceive her when it came to art.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aiyah, this person is still alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk checked the status of the voyeur who had fallen down the stairs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite losing consciousness, he was fine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hana sunbae. I have a request. Please don&#x2019;t tell my story to the police, and just say that the voyeur got excited and fell down the stairs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana easily nodded without asking why.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is like talking about a painting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The artist and forger understood each other.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have tricked the opponent with a perfect imitation of reality.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The proficiency of the Forgery skill is now 99 points.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The proficiency can&#x2019;t rise anymore.]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk returned to the art room and erased his tracks.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana called the police. They would soon come and find the trail of the voyeur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before that, Tae-hyuk got rid of any evidence that revealed that he had been here.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he looked at the message on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The skill proficiency is 99 points!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one step left before he perfectly mastered the Forgery skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now painting won&#x2019;t increase the proficiency anymore.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk only needed to complete the last step now.</span></p><p><span style="">He already guessed how.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to deceive the original owner of the Forgery skill, Big Mama.&#xA0;</span>After doing so, he would take back the Rosario that she had.&#xA0;<span style="">He would be able to achieve his desired objectives.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Then, what are you going to do now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The uninvited person has to disappear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana, who was sitting on the desk of the art room, laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Indeed, you&#x2019;re not a student of this school. I looked up the list of all students and there weren&#x2019;t any transfer students on there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think that you are quite sharp.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana swung her legs, her ankle moving in the moonlight. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you leaving now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I got what I wanted faster than I thought. It was literally the best use of my abilities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uhahat! By the way, what is your name? Can you at least give me your real name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought about it for a brief moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had been less than a week, but he had learned a lot from Lee Hana.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was his mentor in the &#x2018;Forgery&#x2019; skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Seo Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana reached out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is nice to meet you, Seo Tae-hyuk. Alas, good-bye as well. I enjoyed our nightly meetings.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They exchanged their first greetings and goodbye at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana finished her greeting and jumped down from the desk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once again, thank you for everything Sunbae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police sirens were heard from outside the window.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time to disappear.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the Trail of the Sunset in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was a fake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a painting that didn&#x2019;t exist in this world.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama had been looking for this painting for over a decade.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She jumped into the world of imitation art and presented countless forgeries to the world, becoming the crime syndicate representing South Korea.&#xA0;</span>In the end, after 10 years, Big Mama discovered the disastrous truth. The Trail of the Sunset had been burned.</p><p><span style="">That was the last piece of information that Tae-hyuk had on Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was indeed an empty feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knocked on the door of Big Mama&#x2019;s store with a complicated expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo, Tae-hyuk came. You are a little late today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was still busy working.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the covered painting he brought in front of Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mama, no. I will speak bluntly to Big Mama. Make a deal with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a face that showed she knew nothing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk knew that this was a trick.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kim Sang-hyun stole Rosario. Big Mama has it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. But this must mean that you have something to replace it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. It was faster than she thought.</span></p><p><span style="">She used Tae-hyuk to get rid of Kim Sang-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had hidden many things during their transactions, so she deliberately gave out some faulty information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t know what method Tae-hyuk used, but he got rid of Kim Sang-hyun.</span></p><p><span style="">This opponent wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary kid.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Mama had planned to take advantage of Tae-hyuk as her assistant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She planned for him to stay for a year so she could watch his condition.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyway, he had his own things that she wanted from him. He wouldn&#x2019;t escape from her hands just yet.</span></p><p><span style="">That was what she had thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled off the cloth and showed Big Mama the painting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&#x2019;s eyes showed astonishment.</span></p><p><span style="">She had been looking for it for several years.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... The Trail of the Sunset.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama started to check if the painting was authentic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, no matter how much she looked, it was genuine.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where on earth did you find this? Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you hear about how Yoo Cheol-ho was caught a while ago?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a famous story, so I can&#x2019;t not know it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He was actually caught through a tip that I gave.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thus, I received his bounty. However, the prosecution wasn&#x2019;t the only one to give the bounty - the Sungjin Group gave one as well. The daughter of the vice president was one of Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s victims. Therefore, I went to see them to get the bounty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... You have been there. Then, how did you get this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it natural to bring a stolen item to a stolen goods broker?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It meant that this was stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha! Tae-hyuk is right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was a stolen goods broker.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She bought stolen goods at a reasonable price.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So, how much will you buy it for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was confused.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I thought you brought it to make a deal for Rosario.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aish, surely not. Isn&#x2019;t this worth at least two billion?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stolen goods can&#x2019;t receive their original price. It will only amount to around 10% of its market price.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, that is quite a massive profit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then Rosario?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke naturally.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will take it as a down payment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He would receive money and the Rosario.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama laughed pleasantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohoho! As expected, my eyes regarding people aren&#x2019;t wrong. You will definitely be a big shot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you. Anyway... So what will it be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Rosario and 100 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah, you will give me Rosario and 100 million? Big Mama is incredible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I am also a storekeeper.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a satisfactory deal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, the price he had in mind was around 50 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">The Trail of the Sunset didn&#x2019;t even exist in this world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But in the future, his fake would become the new genuine product.</span></p><p><span style="">A fake becoming real.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the final gateway to mastering the Forgery skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, will you make the deal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. No matter how I think about it, I am losing profit. I will be satisfied with this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahah... Is Big Mama really damaged by this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden, Big Mama dragged Tae-hyuk into an embrace.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A rich fragrance wafted out from her body as it became dark.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you fall in love with me at first glance? Let me answer you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof! Ooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama hugged Tae-hyuk harder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk struggled for breath as his face was buried in her chest.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a happy moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This little guy! You are still 10 years too early!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama finally freed Tae-hyuk, who was gasping for air.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Pant pant. I thought I was going to die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His face was completely red.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then wait a few days for the money. I will give Rosario to you straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... By the way, Big Mama. Can I ask one thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The quote for the painting was clearly two billion. 10% of that is 200 million. Perhaps... Is the hug you gave worth 100 million?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo. It isn&#x2019;t that cheap. Don&#x2019;t you think this is enough? Didn&#x2019;t you even touch my chest?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...O-Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words. Indeed, she was a scary woman.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama pulled out Rosario from a deep place and gave it to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So, this is the down payment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will receive it well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, I will prepare the money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The deal was established.</span></p><p><span style="">The fake Trail of the Sunset became authentic.</span></p><p><span style="">A message flashed on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Forgery has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can create one item after the analysis has finished.</span></p><p><span style="">-The quality of the finished object depends on your dexterity stat.</span></p><p><span style="">-You are able to devote your mind to the artwork under the influence of the skill.</span></p><p><span style="">He finally got Forgery!</span></p><p><span style="">The temporary skills window was now free. He could get a new skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;X-ray Vision! Something like X-ray Vision. X-ray Vision.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grinned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will be back in a few days, so I will be going now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama stopped Tae-hyuk from leaving.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she told him one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess the hug isn&#x2019;t enough. There is a man who is after you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... After me?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. I have a picture.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am grateful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t just describe the person, but showed him a picture.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama extended a small picture.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face stiffened the moment he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know this person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A man in his early 40s was drawn.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk never forgot that face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was natural.</span></p><p><span style="">His name was &#x2018;Park Jung-hwan.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was sentenced to death because he was accused of killing him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... Crazy. Why is Park Jung-hwan going after me? What the hell is this?!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t express it because Big Mama was watching.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk was inwardly screaming.</span></p><p><span style="">The smell of a conspiracy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then, I will go now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you ever need a background check, then please ask Mama. Of course, it isn&#x2019;t for free.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe this wouldn&#x2019;t be the end of his relationship with Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">It was his hunch.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk returned home and gave Rosario to his sister.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....T-Tae-hyuk. How did you get this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. I am Seo Tae-hyuk. Noona&#x2019;s little brother, Seo Tae-hyuk. Haha, that is a joke. Kang-suk hyung helped me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I see. Kang-suk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he heard Kang-suk&#x2019;s score rising in Ha-ran&#x2019;s mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Speaking of Kang-suk hyung. He seems busy these days. Did something happen?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran suddenly hugged Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ugh. Isn&#x2019;t today the second time that I ran out of air?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Jung-hwan had been hiding in seclusion since a few years ago. </span><span style="">But what the heck was he doing now? </span><span style="">Was he not just a simple murder victim?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head was filled with such thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof! Oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Noona is worried about you every day. However, it is good to work hard. Promise me you&#x2019;ll take care of yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes reddened after hearing that Ha-ran was worried about him.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran held Rosario in her hand and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The most important thing that Mother left isn&#x2019;t this Rosario.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then she hugged Tae-hyuk even tighter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is you and Tae-min.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
