Should I call them Phantomz?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he drove a stolen car down a small street.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he was thinking about something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantomz, Phantomz. Well. Good!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Inside the trunk were special bombs made by the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he could leave other things to the Phantoms, he would install the bomb himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to reduce the damage to the civilians as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the bomb would blow the whole building down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Many people not involved with the Triads would be affected.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&apos;ve already started this. If so, I will carry the guilt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt emotional.</span></p><p><span style="">Still, it was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since he started to fight the mafia in earnest, he had killed many people, directly or indirectly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, rather than feeling guilty, he felt like it was something he had to do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was surely a criminal...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I really am a criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had always paid attention to his bodily and psychological changes ever since he first received the crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The higher his stats climbed, the more he felt like someone else.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It got worse after Phantom appeared and he started his activities in earnest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is like there is another personality called Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head at the thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had a mountain of work to do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no time to spend on such introspection.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Biiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a message arrived on his phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He parked the car and checked the message.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was from a Phantom.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I can confirm that this medical centre is involved in organs trafficking.</span></i> <i><span style="">There are traces of Chinese mail being sent and received from the computer in the head office.</span></i> <i><span style="">The information...</span></i></p><p><span style="">His Phantoms were doing a lot of work.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyu...how much money have I spent on this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Because there were so many people looking for Phantom, all communication had to be through burner phones.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also hired a hacker through Moonlight Flower to disperse the call history.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The activity fees for the Phantoms are coming from my pocket... There will be a deficit this month.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All the savings he earned in the meantime were shrinking at the speed of light.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Well, if he found the Yamashita gold, then he could get back his money a thousand times over.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no need to look at all of the message.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place he was entering now was run by the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Things similar to the events of the Doll Play incident would be going on.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Plus, it is right next to a port so it is easy to move things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ordered the Phantoms to retreat from the medical centre.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Except for the operating rooms that were deep underground, it was an ordinary medical facility.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The core personnel such as the doctors and guards were people dispatched from the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But in addition to them, it was necessary to have people who would operate the medical centre.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, there were plenty of gaps.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;From the second floor upwards, general patients are hospitalized. Then the operating rooms are only underground?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to get rid of all the doctors, but he decided to endure it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t aiming at the destruction of the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk opened the trunk and check the bombs inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many types available for use in different situations.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is too explosive, so the building might collapse if placed in the wrong area... This should be enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He picked the right type and moved it to the front seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the surface, it looked like an ordinary briefcase.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But if someone tried to forcefully open it or it was the appointed time, the briefcase would explode with a huge force.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, he had to install it in the basement of the medical centre and escape before it exploded 600 seconds later.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened the drawer in the driver&#x2019;s door and saw the familiar Russian made pistol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He placed it at his waist and triggered Vehicle Theft.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was the sound of the engine starting and the car&#x2019;s appearance changed.</span></p><p><span style="">The medium sized car became a luxury Mercedes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The camouflage attribute was to escape without being seen by the police, but he mainly used it to hide his identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He changed his face into Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s and looked like the chauffeur of a luxury car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Counterfeit and Camouflage. The abilities are similar but I like the fact that I don&#x2019;t need to worry by using both at once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he arrived at the medical centre, the security guard watching the &#xA0;back door blocked the car.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry, but if you have an appointment at the medical center, then please go via the front way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk rolled down the window and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you hear from the director? I have a reservation today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard nodded and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, you are a guest here. I understand. Come in.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and stepped on the pedal.</span></p><p><span style="">As he parked the car in a good location, the guard came hurrying over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had realized something was strange.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&apos;m really sorry. What is the name of the person riding in the back? I asked the director and there are no plans for a surgery today...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, the person in the back?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;m sorry. The atmosphere is tense these days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The grim reaper bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hit the guard with the iron pipe that was hidden in the back seat of the car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve smashed a few places so the guards are more careful these days. I have to watch out in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Other guards would notice over time and come flocking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed the briefcase and headed to the underground area of the medical centre.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-You! What are you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Bullet Time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk invoked Bullet Time as guards with guns gathered around him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His mind accelerated and time seemed to be going dozens of times slower.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is surprisingly busy despite there being no booking today. Are they preparing to export the products?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and fired at the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is made using Forgery but it is almost the same as the real thing. Isn&#x2019;t this almost an art?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">After becoming a Noble, the attribute Trace was added to Forgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had the ability to copy not only the appearance, but the function of the object.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could make bullets and guns if he had the materials.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Shooting Spree couldn&#x2019;t be used with his created guns, so he had to be satisfied with just bullets.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;How do you like the taste of the bullets that I sweated to make!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As the guards all fell, Tae-hyuk leisurely turned off Bullet Time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a scream belatedly entered his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Argggghhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a security camera in the hallway. Other guards would see it and come flocking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to finish all the work before that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk quickly left the medical centre after setting up the &#xA0;bomb in a place that was deep underground.</span></p><p><span style="">But it was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t see any other security guards.</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t just responsible for protecting this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They handled all types of dirty things from kidnapping to corpse handling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, there were at least 10 security guards working at the medical centres.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did they run away because Phantom attacked?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had already blown away five of the Triads&#x2019; businesses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used the method of blowing up the buildings.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk disguised himself as a guard who he had killed already.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he headed into the lobby of the medical centre.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-Run away! P-Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A bomb will explode! Take your valuables and run away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about the hospitalized patients?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck! Our lives are more important, so why should we worry about them? Destroy all of the important documents and flee!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he looked at the staff members running around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man, who seemed to be the director, screamed when he saw Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing? Why are you just standing there? Pack up and prepare to escape like planned...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, they even practiced running away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly pulled out the opera mask and placed it on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, it looks like you are busy. I&#x2019;m sorry. Can I ask questions at the reception desk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phan...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t stutter because your panties are so tight. When will the ship come to the port to pick up the exported goods?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like it is hard to say. Do you want a little help?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out his gun and aimed it at the director.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll ask once again. When will the smuggling vehicle come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The director of the medical centre flopped to the ground and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tonight at 8 o&#x2019;clock... But you can&#x2019;t meet them unless I contact... S-So please, my life...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the phone from the director&#x2019;s pocket and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you! You contact them on this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes. That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. Oh, this is a gift.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a pair of handcuffs and placed one link on the handle of the briefcase he was holding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other side was connected to the director&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t try to open this. It might pop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaagh!&quot; B-Bomb...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I hope you can escape safely.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked out of the medical centre.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A bomb was connected to the director&#x2019;s hand!&#xA0;</span><span style="">The employees screamed and ran away after realizing this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The director shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;C-Cut it off right now! Bring a tool! Even if it is from the operating room, just bring a tool! </span></p><p><span style="">What on earth would be cut off?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was very curious but just left.</span></p><p><span style="">The security guards were too busy trying to deal with the bomb connected to the director that they didn&#x2019;t chase Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Will he be shocked to know that only documents are inside?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The real bomb was in the basement of the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were 480 seconds until the bomb would explode.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started the car as he imagined what would happen in the meantime.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">After the medical center, dealing with the transport ship was anticlimactic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The sun rose and broke apart the darkness of the sea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The trees will blow like this on the weekend.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the blood on his clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He thought he had been careful but some seemed to splattered on his clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had shot many bullets in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I won&#x2019;t be able to go home like this. I should go to a public bath.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After setting his next destination, he stretched and started the car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time he was Phantom, not Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia, Yakuza and the Triads were feeling various emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng&#x2019;s one was anger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The young boss of the Huaqing Triad, Li Zheng, opened his drawer after hearing the report from his subordinate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He aimed a gun at the subordinate and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Taaang - tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The subordinate instantly collapsed.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought he was just a clown, but now he is trying to bite. I can&#x2019;t just continue watching.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng ordered another subordinate to get rid of the dead body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though a colleague had died, his eyes were burning with loyalty.&#xA0;I</span><span style="">f Li Zheng ordered him to commit suicide, he would do it without any hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Prepare a private plane. I will meet directly with Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Boss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His men were confused.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a boss with countless subordinates, yet he was going to meet Phantom directly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was too dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">However, determination was fully entrenched in Li Zheng&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, his men couldn&#x2019;t stop Li Zheng.</span></p><p><span style="">The case of Yamaguchi Takeshi, the leader of Japan&#x2019;s Yakuza, was curious.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
