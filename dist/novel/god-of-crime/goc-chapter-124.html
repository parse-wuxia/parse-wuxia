<p><span style="">Chapter 124 - Swallow the Sun #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Anybody that had their close family or a friend that fell into a cult would somehow try to rescue them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Sun Cult had dedicated personnel to deal with such people.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a remote place far from the centre of the city.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was only a factory and some rice fields around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, most of the stores that traded with university students had closed down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to the extent that there was just a lonely convenience store.</span></p><p><span style="">If there was an appointment to meet someone about the Sun Cult, they would inevitably meet at this cafe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is because there has to be a meeting before entering the base of the cult. This cafe is the best trap. However, doesn&#x2019;t the status of the leader seem a bit low?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been one year after gaining the crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did he feel like this because he had faced so many criminals in the meantime?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk found 12 hidden cameras inside the cafe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also mini-microphones installed at the tables.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously, the bishops of the Sun Cult would be checking all of the guests that entered here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Using Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s abilities, he could penetrate the building without anyone knowing.</span></p><p><span style="">But in order to shatter the Sun cult, he needed to use a frontal attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Here is your coffee. By the way, I guess you have been waiting for someone. Have they arrived yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the door as he replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is a little late but I think he is coming now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a rattle as someone entered the cafe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, the gazes of the people inside the cafe would focus on him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a man in his 30s with shortly cropped hair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His physique showed that he exercised a significant amount.</span></p><p><span style="">The man looked around the cafe and confirmed that there were only two people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He turned to Tae-hyuk and bowed slightly,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you Kim Cheol-su?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes. Hello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am Lee Gun-woo. Pleased to meet you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He extended a small business card towards Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The words &#x2018;Republic of Korea&#x2019;s Army&#x2019; in English and the title of &#x2018;Captain&#x2019; were written.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Lee Gun-woo received Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s business card and muttered with a surprised face,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It is your real name. Ah. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, it is okay. Isn&#x2019;t it a name you often see in textbooks?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyone who saw the business card with &#x2018;Kim Cheol-su, maths teacher&#x2019; would have the same reaction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people had only exchanged a few phone calls.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time actually meeting today.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo ordered a glass of white mocha and sat at the table where Tae-hyuk was currently at. </span><span style="">Then he carefully started his story.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo was a lieutenant who failed to get promoted and was preparing for discharge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He then found out that his sister had become involved in the &#x2018;Sun&#x2019; cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was searching for a person to help him and met Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, I hadn&#x2019;t thought about going there directly at first. She is an adult and I should leave her to her own work. However... I don&#x2019;t think I can leave her in a cult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a heavy expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I also want to regain the family that I lost to the Sun Cult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That family is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, my little brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. At any rate, I want to find Min-young and bring her out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two people exchanged information about the Sun Cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And there were a few eyes watching them.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The base of the Sun Cult was only a minute&#x2019;s drive from the cafe.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo started the car and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted to bring a handgun, like a pistol. However, I don&#x2019;t have much time left until my discharge, and I don&#x2019;t want to go to military prison, so I am just a soldier in spirit.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Then did you bring any weapons?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I brought a small rod, so I will be fine. Rather, you should be careful as a maths teacher.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. A lot of students abandoned maths so I had to study other subjects.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo continued to joke around as if to calm himself down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he suddenly stopped and raised his hand from the steering wheel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t even time for a deep breath as they arrived at the base of the Sun Cult.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke like it was the first time he had visited this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t as large as I thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems so. I thought that it would at least have an atmosphere similar to that of a military base or a prison, but the fence is low and people can freely enter and leave.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew the answer but he didn&#x2019;t speak it aloud.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was just a high school teacher whose family member was taken away.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason for having no barriers or guards was simple: the Sun followers lived in groups of five.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were the shackles that restricted each other&#x2019;s actions.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo took slow, deep breaths and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hu... Then as we already discussed, let&#x2019;s break through the front.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if it wasn&#x2019;t wide, there were three 4-story buildings.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how they moved, it would take a while with just two of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see we have people who came to visit. Sun welcomes all visitors.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they drove through the gate, a few people in suits came out to greet them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man standing in the front said with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hwanin said you would come and you really did. The two of you are welcome.&#x201D; (Hwanin: <a href="en.wikipedia.org">google link</a>. I suggest you glance over this link because this myth will be mentioned several times)</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo&#x2019;s eyes widened at the unexpected hospitality.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kim Cheol-su and Lee Gun-woo, please follow me. Min-young is waiting for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo groaned as the name of his sister emerged from the man&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How do you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hwanin knows everything. Then please come this way for a more detailed explanation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guide was one of the bishops of the Sun Cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They followed him and arrived at a big bathroom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t I going to see my younger sister? And how the hell did you know my name and my sister&#x2019;s name? Perhaps...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo was obviously agitated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He even came to this place without saying anything to his little sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then suddenly, he recalled a rumor about Sun&#x2019;s leader.</span></p><p><span style="">He called himself the incarnation of Hwanin and had the ability to see the past, present, and future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surely those abilities weren&#x2019;t real.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such thoughts disappeared from his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t believe in things like that in this world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was obviously some crafty trick.</span></p><p><span style="">The bishop smiled at Gun-woo&#x2019;s look of suspicion and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but there is an order in everything. First you have to clean your body and wipe away everything of this world. Then we will arrange some clothes for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Gun-woo didn&#x2019;t protest again and entered the bathroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk followed behind him with a puzzled expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, Tae-hyuk knew the trick used by the bishop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How did he do that? It was a cold reading based on the contents of the wiretap. What the hell, wasn&#x2019;t that a tactic used a few hundred years ago?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a technique that utilized psychological tricks during a conversation to guess what the person was thinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The information that they have isn&#x2019;t perfect yet, so they will use the time in the bathroom to supplement it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like watching a young child&#x2019;s cute tricks.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, if that is what you wish. I&#x2019;ll give it to you.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The smiling expression disappeared from the bishop&#x2019;s face as the two men entered the bathroom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu. The two of them don&#x2019;t know that they are moths in a web. Hey, what are you doing? Go grab their ID cards and phones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Make sure to set up some massages. It should take at least one hour.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">During that time, all the preparations needed to be finished.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bishop made them take a bath under the pretense of being cleansed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a prelude to the scam that would now begin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been a while since people have fallen into the trap.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cafe and nearby rest areas were all operated by Sun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Those who visited there were under the watchful eye of Sun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If one of them tried to come here, then it would be like this event.</span></p><p><span style="">When bathing, everyone was forced to undress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, they would leave their wallets and phones in the locker room.</span></p><p><span style="">The believers entered and came outside with something.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We got everything!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Check if they have SNS and get as much personal information as you can. I&#x2019;ll be unlocking the phones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bishop smiled as he received the phones from the believers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Smartphones made cold reading much easier.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This little device contained everything about a person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moreover, it was possible to release the fingerprint lock.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It there are fingerprints, then we can collect a lot of it. After making the artificial fingerprint, I can see all the personal information. It is a really good world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Name, gender, age as well as the place of birth and what school they attended.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The name and contact information of the people they knew.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The most visited sites on the Internet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there was the ID card.</span></p><p><span style="">From there, it was simple to pass on the information and make the leader appear like the incarnation of Hwanin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only thing left was how to produce a plausible stage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is very simple. We have done this over 100 times.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bishop laughed and headed for his studio with the two phones.</span></p><p><span style="">An hour passed by.</span></p><p><span style="">After bathing, Tae-hyuk and Gun-woo opened the bathroom door and went outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The waiting believer held out some clothes and a glass of milk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is milk gained directly from the cows raised here. There are no external chemicals ,so you can drink with confidence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Gun-woo muttered as he took it,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It really feels like everything about the world has been washed away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then they heard the voice of the waiting bishop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was cleansing. You have been purged through Hwanin&#x2019;s power. Now you are ready to meet Hwanin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, then your name...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am called Song Chi-hyun. The founder is waiting. Please follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Gun-woo walked down the long corridor as they followed Song Chi-hyun, a bishop of the Sun Cult.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
