<p><span style="">Chapter 128 - Mister Park&#x2019;s Identity #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">He pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror and checked the message.</span></p><p><span style="">[317 affinity points have been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">[You can use the affinity points to enhance crime skills or activate hidden attributes.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;317 affinity points?!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Until now, he had mainly only received around 10 at a time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he obtained so many points in one go.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My prediction was right. I get affinity points for changing someone&#x2019;s fate.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was rare for people to lose their lives after getting involved with Sun. Despite that, he gained more than 300 points so Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hypothesis was correct.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then how should I use these points?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He could strengthen all the skills he had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t received any new skills since he had acquired Illegal Surgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The more skills that Tae-hyuk added, the wider range of things that he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a special menu that wasn&#x2019;t usually seen popped up.</span></p><p><span style="">[Platinum Draw Chance!]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can obtain various skills by using 10 affinity points.</span></p><p><span style="">-It is possible to acquire skills that aren&#x2019;t available due to the low rank.</span></p><p><span style="">-The more you draw in a row, the more points that will be consumed.</span></p><p><span style="">After becoming a Noble, the points consumed had returned to its original value.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. I should use the points to learn a few new skills. Preferably, something that increases my attack power.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The only skill he could use for fighting was Violence, using the iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was confident that he could win against any opponent using Damage to Both Sides.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was too weak to be used in a one versus many situation. </span><span style="">In order to fight the mafia in the future, he needed a better skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought that and carefully pressed the button.</span></p><p><span style="">The roulette on the Demon Revealing Mirror started spinning.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were cheerful sound effects as he received the message that he got a new skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Vehicle Theft has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Anything with an engine can be freely used by holding the handle.</span></p><p><span style="">-The ability will be affected by your dexterity.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-It is subtle...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a skill that could be utilized in various ways, but it wasn&#x2019;t the ability that he desired.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...One more draw.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to gain another skill by consuming 100 points.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I could do more if I had 1,000 points.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was, what skill would he get next?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted a decent combat skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk once again tried the platinum challenge.</span></p><p><span style="">This time, he clicked the button very carefully.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A huge 100 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could&#x2019;ve invested this in Voice Modulation or Counterfeit.</span></p><p><span style="">He gulped nervously as he looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were cheerful sound effects as he received the message that he got a new skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Shooting Spree has been acquiring.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can handle various firearms freely.</span></p><p><span style="">-For 100 affinity points, you can learn the attribute Bullet Time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? This is a j-j-jackpot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk, who had been watching the Demon Revealing Mirror nervously, let out an excited cheer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had acquired a combat skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he had the guns that he took from Big Brother.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have a lot of bullets, but they would do well as secret weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was an uneasy part about the message in the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bullet Time? It is a named attribute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Among the attributes, there were those with unique names such as Hawk Eyes, Damage to Both Sides, and Sixth Sense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike other skill attributes, a large number of points were consumed, but the performance was enormous.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to check the description of Bullet Time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a buff-type skill that could only be activated with firearms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Accelerated thinking?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Bullet Time was cast, everything except for Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s consciousness moved 100 times slower.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One moment could feel like eternity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He unknowingly exclaimed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had a limit of only one minute a day, but it was a tremendous skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, it would show great synergy with Sixth Sense that allowed him to read the enemy&#x2019;s attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the Bullet Time attribute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could get it by moving one finger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although he had to spend 100 points on the attribute, it was worth it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&#x2019;t a worker&#x2019;s salary, but one that should be used immediately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once he learned the Bullet Time attribute, he would have 107 points left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would leave 50 points and spend the rest on the features he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Increase the duration of the Counterfeit skill. Make Forgery more complete. Increase the range and accuracy of Robbery...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, increase the time he had to cancel Illegal Surgery and other attributes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He supplemented all of the crime skills that he had obtained so far.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now it is finished...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">With this, Tae-hyuk had 10 crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had become so powerful that he couldn&#x2019;t be compared to the past.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then the only thing left is to secure the scammers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk closed the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror with a satisfied face and hid himself in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun stepped back into a corner of the auditorium and said in a dignified voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pungbaek will speak. So everybody, listen carefully.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun looked anxiously at Pungbaek.</span></p><p><span style="">The words that came from his mouth would decide the future of &#x2018;Sun&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the leader wasn&#x2019;t a fool, so he would give up his position if he had to.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The believers in the auditorium listened to Pungbaek&#x2019;s speech with tense expressions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After thousands of years, I am able to appear in front of you thanks to Hwanin. I...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The faces of the believers filled with surprise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Clouds rushed around Pungbaek, creating a mysterious atmosphere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The appearance of a man who literally controlled the wind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t possibly be a trick or gimmick.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he was talking to half-brainwashed believers.</span></p><p><span style="">In order to break them, Pungbaek would have to announce that he was a fake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Pungbaek laughed and said words that no one expected.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...am a fake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The believers showed a violent reaction to Pungbaek&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk, who was drinking tea in the audience with a calm expression, spilled the tea he was drinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-W-What?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho fell down where they were standing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Chi-hyun maintained his calm and tried to fix the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, ha, ha. Pungbaek really... Even in this situation, you don&#x2019;t lose your wit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and placed his fingers at his chin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the special makeup that had been fully assimilated to his skin was peeled off and his original face revealed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The believers who saw it shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What the? A costume?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The face behind the special makeup clearly looked like a criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the appearance of Kim Cheol-su from Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His face was scary enough to cause the believers to shrink back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was reasonable since the believers didn&#x2019;t have immunity to such things.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke into the microphone with a relaxed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhuhu... My conscience is pricked by those who are pretending to be gods. My face was changed due to special disguise makeup. The clouds are nothing but a superconductor that binds water vapour.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even after hearing such words, one of the faithful believers shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If everything is a scam, how did they know my history? Hwanin can obviously see the past, present and future. How else can you explain it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used the iron pipe to stop the bishops and pressed something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then on one side of the auditorium, the projector screen descended.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-T-This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The embarrassed bishops headed towards Tae-hyuk but the believers were staring at the screen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was showing videos from the secret cameras installed in the cafe and convenience store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among the recorded footage, there were videos of believers who were here now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-Isn&#x2019;t that me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is the story of my childhood! Didn&#x2019;t he pretend to have the power to know this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t they complete con artists?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pressed a button again and more evidence of the scam popped up.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Song Chi-hyun realized that this situation couldn&#x2019;t be rectified.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He quietly spoke to his colleagues standing behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, we should get out of here. Shit. That bastard hit us in the back...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to stop Tae-hyuk but the water had already been spilled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, his colleagues didn&#x2019;t reply.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Chi-hyun gulped and slowly looked back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho couldn&#x2019;t be seen at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Those bastards ran away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The other bishops and the leader had escaped the auditorium in the turmoil.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Chi-hyun looked at the believers surrounding him with a flustered expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have scammed us.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? I brought all my possessions to you. That was a trick?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I won&#x2019;t be able to close my eyes if I don&#x2019;t hit you now. Everyone pounce!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun was stunned and lost consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The sweating Park Bum-ho opened his eyes in the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He told Kim Jin-woo who was sitting next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae... I had an unbelievably strange dream. Pungbaek appeared in my setting, then Pungbaek revealed to all the believers what we did.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk, who was sitting behind him, aimed a high kick towards Park Bum-ho&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This brat fainted in the middle and thought it was a dream? What? A dream? Dreaaam? Fuck... I hope it is all a dream...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuooh.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Bum-ho realized that it wasn&#x2019;t a dream, but something that happened a few hours ago.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jin-woo said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Leader. What should we do now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop calling me leader. Are you still saying that in this situation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, we have to escape from this place. It is like how the people were enraged at the king and queen during the French Revolution. They clearly feel anger towards us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jin-woo trembled as he got goose bumps.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Chief. What should we do now?&#x201D; There are many believers out there. If I knew this then I would&#x2019;ve made a secret passageway...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The total number of believers was over 1,000.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would keep hiding like this, but they would soon be discovered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We are trapped rats... But who the hell is that bastard? No matter how I looked, he was real.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-it seemed like it. The thing he did it front of us, it wasn&#x2019;t special makeup.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I know of only one person who can freely change their face...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Cho Min-hyuk fell silent as he got goose bumps and swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was one person who could change his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was definitely a famous criminal in the country.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The appearance of the phantom masked person appeared in his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This truly is a predicament.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone&#x2019;s voice was heard from behind them.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk cried out,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Who are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then something white came closer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the mask worn by the main character of the Phantom of the Opera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And the criminal wearing it was clearly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You mean me? I am Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom appeared in front of the scammers.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
