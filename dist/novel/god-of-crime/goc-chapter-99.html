<p><span style="">Chapter 99: Advance Notice of a Storm #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about? I didn&#x2019;t kill anyone. I&#x2019;m innocent and was wrongfully locked up in prison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you think I was such a monster? If so, you are mistaken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stared at Park Sung-yul with an absurd expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he was a rookie then he would be confused if he encountered such an opponent, and wouldn&#x2019;t be able to interrogate him properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now he was a detective who caught many horrible criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t show any panic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he did then he would be playing right into Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk instantly returned to his usual calm.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? By the way, have you eaten lunch yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s mouth twitched at the calm answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I knew you were coming so late then I would&#x2019;ve eaten beforehand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You didn&#x2019;t eat while &#xA0;you were waiting? Would you like jajangmyeon to be delivered? Oh, they don&#x2019;t deliver here. In other words, I&#x2019;ll have to ask the kitchen. Is ramyun okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It is good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then some ramyun please. Bring a pot with lots of water. There should be enough for three to five people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk called the guards and asked them to boil ramyun noodles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After 10 minutes, three pots were delivered to the visitation room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you know? This ramyun is exactly to my tastes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul was hungry and isntantly emptied the pot full of noodles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk asked as he ate the food,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Since you are so far away, I guess you don&#x2019;t have many people visiting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if I was on land, no one would come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? Weren&#x2019;t you close to the daughter of your old boarding house landlord?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t remember since it was so long ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. I understand. At any rate, tell me if you want more. I&#x2019;ll have them boil extra.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is okay, I&#x2019;m full.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since then, the detective and criminal talked like they were old friends.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t ask anymore about Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s letter and soon, the one hour of visitation time was over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk got up and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is there anything else to talk about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I had a great time meeting a person after a while. See you next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Next time? Yes. Well, I&#x2019;ll see what happens first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes Detective, take care.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho, who was sitting at the table next to Kang-suk, also got up and gave a thumbs up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that Kang-suk was as good of an interrogator as he said beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk sighed slowly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This really didn&#x2019;t suit him.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">After the interrogation, the detective and investigator talked about it in the waiting room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it truly the boarding house?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it is obvious from his reaction. By the way, your brain is very good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t even say it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two men had decided in advance what direction to take the conversation, based on Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was well aware of what he was lacking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he left the thinking to Joo Hyun-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After reading the letter from Park Sung-yul, Hyun-ho had investigated everything about him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, he looked for any people who went missing in the vicinity of Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">The one who caught Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s attention was the daughter of the landlord of a boarding house &#xA0;where Park Sung-yul stayed for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho read her profile and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Her age at the time of her disappearance is consistent. It was found that she had an argument with Park Sung-yul a few days before she went missing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then why was the incident buried when Park Sung-yul was arrested?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was only circumstantial evidence, no physical ones. Furthermore, he had a decisive alibi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the time she went missing, Park Sung-yul was in China.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, I requested a DNA test so we should figure out the correct identity in a few days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This makes it more likely that Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s words are true. But why did he suddenly change his words?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not sure what Park Sung-yul is thinking. Besides, I think he also wanted to slip into the conversation that he killed the landlord&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk quietly groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahem...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A criminal had confessed his sins in a letter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He threw clues one by one like puzzle pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe Park Sung-yul is enjoying playing with the police. In addition, the first puzzle was based on things about him. It feels like he gave us the easiest puzzle first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. So now we have to wait until he throws us another puzzle?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are 12 people left...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It will never end this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t want to give up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want the 12 murders committed by Park Sung-yul to forever remain as hidden cases.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk discovered that Hyun-ho was making a strange expression, meaning that he had a secret plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you thinking?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho licked his lips and his eyes lit up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It looked like he was enjoying the puzzle made by Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Park Sung-yul wants to play with us. Sunbae, do you know how to unconditionally win in poker?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. Don&#x2019;t you win if you can read your opponent&#x2019;s face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...There is such a thing. Well, there is something simpler. There should be a spy to tell you the opponent&#x2019;s hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk realized what Joo Hyun-ho wanted: It was to have a spy monitor Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s movements in the Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk folded his arms and frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a little bit like cheating but... The method isn&#x2019;t bad. The problem is finding someone to spy on Park Sung-yul in Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">It was best to use a prisoner as a source of intelligence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guards were considered public enemies by the monitored and controlled prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So there was a strange sense of fellowship and they often exchanged stories in secret.</span></p><p><span style="">In other prisons, there were people imprisoned for three to six months for misdemeanor crimes such as theft.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them could be used as sources of information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they were discovered as a spy then their lives could be in danger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the ones who would be stuck in jail for a long time wouldn&#x2019;t act as spies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I think it will be fine if Hyung approaches them with the offer of reducing their sentence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk spoke in a strong tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Absolutely not!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then do you have a good idea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we can&#x2019;t get it from the inside, can&#x2019;t we get it from the outside?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, imprison someone in Blue Dragon Prison who would act as their spy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, that is good. It&apos;s definitely possible to do that if we get the permission of the warden. Ah right, no police. Criminals have a really sensitive smell towards the police.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If they are discovered as a spy then they might be lynched...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, it needed to be a person who wouldn&#x2019;t be unnatural in prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, in order to become familiar with other criminals, they needed a special crime that would grab attention.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Someone who looks like a criminal, has courage, and also has strength... I think a masked superhero would be needed to satisfy all the conditions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong... The right person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk desperately thought about who could fit into the Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, someone popped into his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ooof...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was nauseous as he entered the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A dark aura of death was pouring out from it. There was no need to activate the Spying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As he walked to the center, something stuck to his shoes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he checked his foot, he saw something like crushed meat.</span></p><p><span style="">This was one of the two secret rooms in the basement of the hospital.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place where the relics of the Japanese military would be somewhere that hadn&#x2019;t been touched for decades.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this place showed evidence of being frequented by somebody.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;The result is a boom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt a cold chill like he was in a freezer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the plastic bags piled up in the middle of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was something small in them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He brought his hand to a bag to see what it was.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a strange illusion emerged in front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heok!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same as when he entered the bathroom that the hippo had killed in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, unlike then, he didn&#x2019;t see anybody being killed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Instead, he heard a conversation.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I need a liver.</span></i> <i><span style="">The shape can&#x2019;t be broken.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You don&#x2019;t want finely chopped pieces?</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">-Yes, that&apos;s right.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Of course, all organs are extracted as they are.</span></i> <i><span style="">You don&apos;t have to be worry.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you wish then we can do a wholesale trade.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I would like to do it if the price is worth it.</span></i> <i><span style="">Is 10 possible?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He figured out what they were trading.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the organs of the aborted fetuses.</span></p><p><span style="">The words of Jung Eui-do momentarily popped into his head.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Our clinic does abortions up to 36 months.</span></i></p><p><span style="">This was the reason.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had seen a similar sight not long ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">T Medical Centre had kidnapped children and extracted their organs for transplant surgery. &#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the purpose of the ones buying the fetuses here...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh, I can&#x2019;t unsee this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bags were filled with the bodies of those who weren&#x2019;t born.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were piled up in a frozen warehouse like pig and cattle meat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk captured it all on camera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once this was revealed, the media would become heated up for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk left the room and pulled out the blueprint in his back pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the last remaining place was definitely where the Japanese army hid the treasure map.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know why it went unnoticed for decades.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The entrance was the bottom of an old well in the backyard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a passage to enter from the basement, but it seemed to have been covered over with concrete when a boiler room was made.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, it was either go down the well, or smash the concrete floor with a pickaxe.</span></p><p><span style="">It was one of the reasons why he left it for last.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Everybody in the building would come running if I use a pickaxe. I have to use the well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked towards the backyard.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The well wasn&#x2019;t difficult to find.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t been used for a long time so there was a rusty chain around it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Weeds were growing around it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyone who didn&#x2019;t know there was a well here would mistake it for someone&#x2019;s grave.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk equipped the iron pipe using the Violence skill and struck the chain surrounding the well.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was rusty so the chain was removed more easily than he thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s go down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was completely dry or filled with water, the depths of the well looked like an abyss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk held a flashlight in his mouth and climbed down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After 10 meters, he reached the bottom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it okay if I am a little noisy at this depth?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He placed the iron pipe between the pipes and put strength into it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The stones cracked and the well wall collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The result was a passage leading somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk widened the hole so that his body could fit through and entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. Rat pellets...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk rubbed the foreign matter on his hands against the wall and straightened his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a small space that was only one pyeong large.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Several wooden boxes were stacked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. These are canned foods.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t the one pull type that appeared these days, but cans that required a special opener.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bingo. This is a shelter created by the Japanese.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spat out some dust and started to search the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I found it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a small room, so he could easily find what he was looking for.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the document with joy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... I imagined something like a rolled parchment paper... Isn&#x2019;t this a plain file folder?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a little yellow, which wasn&#x2019;t surprising, but the state of preservation wasn&#x2019;t bad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly started to read it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was written in Japanese so he had to get help from a translation application installed on his smartphone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;We have decided to keep all the remaining war funds in a designated place... The general manager is Yamashita Toshiro...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&apos;s hands trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This is Yamashita&#x2019;s gold!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">During a building renovation, an astronomical amount of gold was found.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now it was sleeping in a place where no one could touch it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He held the location where it was hidden.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s fingers started shaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aha, ahahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He burst out laughing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A few billion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was treasure worth billions of won, and it would soon enter his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It looks like I can build a castle for my sister&#x2019;s wedding gift, not just buy her a house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything he imagined could become possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t just changing his future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With this, he could have a completely new life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019;t be too difficult to dispose of it using the Phantom&#x2019;s ability.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, where is the treasure actually hidden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk glanced at the map in the documents, but something was wrong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he saw it, but something was familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...This is the Blue Dragon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shouted out loud.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place on the map was the Blue Dragon Prison where he would be imprisoned in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. So that&#x2019;s what happened.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized why Yamashita&#x2019;s gold was only discovered two years later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a ruin that no one had entered for decades before the Blue Dragon Prison was built.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two years later, the Blue Dragon Prison started a massive expansion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was during the construction that Yamashita&#x2019;s gold was found.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lived in Blue Dragon Prison for 10 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The expansion work continued even when Tae-hyuk was imprisoned, so he definitely remembered where it was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, I need to go back to where I died to get the gold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly smirked.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
