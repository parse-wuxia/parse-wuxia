<p><span style="">Chapter 144 - War Between Criminals #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Kazuo, who was in charge of the South Korean branch, died in an accident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, it would&#x2019;ve been a big event, due to a struggle over the successor of the branch.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi removed the seeds of the conflict by appointing a successor as soon as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, Mister Park was promoted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was Kazuo&#x2019;s right arm, and oversaw the general operations of the Korean branch.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi came to the conclusion that the South Korean branch could be left to Mister Park.</span></p><p><span style="">But...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom, Phantom.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a big TV screen in front of Yamaguchi, with a mysterious man wearing an opera mask declared war on the mafia on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a scene from a movie.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A declaration of war to the mafia by one man alone might seem reckless but... According to reports, it isn&#x2019;t the case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Mister Park, who was sitting at his feet, looked up and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right. Phantom has done impossible things on his own, and it&#x2019;s almost like he&#x2019;s using alter egos. So I investigated and...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi pulled Mister Park up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You have been promoted, so don&#x2019;t feel the need to be so submissive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I see. I don&#x2019;t think I have enough resources to stop Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Stop talking about Phantom for now. First of all, sit here. I will consider your opinion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi was the boss of the Japanese Yakuza that had thousands of members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even Mister Park was like a young child in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi stroked his white beard as he read the information prepared by Mister Park.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantoms. He really is smart. He doesn&#x2019;t need to come directly. Just move the symbol, and he will get what he wants. Could you do this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyone could become a Phantom by putting on the mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would move little by little and deal damage to the mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza became family by sharing alcohol mixed with each other&#x2019;s blood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a sacred ritual and betrayal meant death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They all worked under the Oyabun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the Phantoms became allies just be receiving a mask through the courier service.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was possible since Phantom used the symbol of the opera mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many Phantoms are there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&apos;t know. Dozens or hundreds... No, maybe even more than that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scariest thing about the Phantoms was that they were an enormous force on the Internet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, unlike the Yakuza, none of them were willing to give their lives for Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were just Phantoms for fun and felt satisfied to be involved with Phantom in some way.</span></p><p><span style="">The instructions also weren&#x2019;t too difficult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They just needed to deliver an item or install something somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a result, people with special talents started to gather.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The group is less than two months old, and yet it is like this... Truly an interesting man. Mister Park.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much damage has he inflicted?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;11 farms and 93 employees...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi was speechless for a while after hearing Mister Park&#x2019;s report.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he coughed and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then the opponent&#x2019;s damage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Sorry, there is none.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu, I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was understandable why Mister Park had come.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This might be the biggest defeat in their history.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to see him directly. Unfortunately, that is too much. I should pull out the protruding nail, not batter it. Mister Park.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From today on, the Hayabusa will help you. With their power, you should be able to stand up against Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Hayabusa!&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were a special group of criminals with various skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hackers, card cheats, terrorists, magicians, scammers, etc.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were normally scattered all over Japan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once Yamaguchi called, they would gather to carry out his orders.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their abilities were enough to even assassinate a witness protected by the FBI.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They specialized in intelligence and warfare.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park gulped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yamaguchi wanted to collapse the Phantom system as well as Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If Phantom wants to fight, then I will accept. With the help of the Hayabusa, find all of the identities of the Phantoms and kill them. Then all of South Korea will know that cooperating with Phantom will mean death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park looked determined.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I hope to live up to your expectations.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will let you handle this work directly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also thought that this was the only way to deal with the Phantoms.</span></p><p>@</p><p><span style="">Caterina was the godfather of the Red Mafia in Russia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her feelings towards Phantom were beyond obsession.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Semon. What clothes should I wear the next time we meet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. I&#x2019;ll bring the best fashion coordinator and stylist if you want.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you please do that? By the way, have you heard the news? After defeating the Yakuza, Phantom easily dealt with the Triads. How is this possible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina didn&#x2019;t have the dignity of a godfather.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was because she was lacking that Semon was helping her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Caterina had the ability to penetrate sharply into the essence of things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she was raised properly, then she could someday become the queen of the Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">But she changed after she met Phantom and he saved her life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She became a girl completely in love.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She also ceased trying to talk like a tough man.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one thing left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the sake of the organization, and for Caterina as well, he had to put all his effort into making Phantom her partner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">To do that, he would do anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is possible because the mask is the symbol of Phantom. And don&apos;t worry so much, Phantom definitely has feelings for you. Why else would he meet you so easily?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Perhaps the Phantoms was a plan he had put on hold before. And there is one prerequisite to do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Prerequisite?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon coughed several times.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom is a free body that doesn&#x2019;t belong anywhere. If he is working under the name of a criminal organization, then no one will want to join the Phantoms.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then it was understandable why he rejected Caterina&#x2019;s courtship.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was surprisingly positive thinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was too short-sighted! I really thought Phantom didn&#x2019;t like me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And look at this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon pulled out a letter with the mark of an opera mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is an invitation from him. He is inviting you to a party.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Wah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina laughed and clapped her hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She seemed genuinely pleased.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is next week. Do you want to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course! Can you call the people you mentioned earlier? I want to give Phantom the coolest show!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But they were mistaken.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, the Red Mafia wasn&#x2019;t the only ones to receive Phantom&#x2019;s invitation.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are Phantoms here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park led the Hayabusa members to a house outside Seoul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had been chasing the trail of the Phantoms for three days.</span></p><p><span style="">An enormous amount of manpower and capital was invested to find the clues left behind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they found someone acting as Phantom and killed them, the group wouldn&#x2019;t be able to act like they were doing now.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park checked his bulletproof vest and loaded bullets into the gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a warning that anyone who cooperated with Phantom would die.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They might have joined Phantoms as a game, but I will let them know this isn&#x2019;t one. Rush in!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was like chasing the enemy king in chess.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time, he received Yamaguchi&#x2019;s order to deal with the matter directly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to get the Hayabusa&#x2019;s cooperation thanks to that.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park clicked his tongue and murmured,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I will spend the week killing Phantoms. Well, I don&#x2019;t have to do too much. Once 10 people die, it will start dismantling on its own.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Some Hayabusa members were monitoring from a van nearby.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the police starting moving, then they would leave in 10 seconds.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The door was smashed open and an ordinary family home appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was garbage piled up, showing that it hadn&#x2019;t been cleaned for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the fact that it was a weekday, someone was watching the TV.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, people who joined Phantoms had nothing to do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park aimed his gun at the person covered in a blanket and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes. It is wrong not to tell you the reason for your death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You will die. There are three reasons. The first sin is signing up to join the Phantoms. The second sin is harming the Yakuza. And the third sin...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the man took the blanket off and stood up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now a grey mask could be seen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Oh, I was surprised! Y-Yes. You are a Phantom after being sent the mask. Isn&#x2019;t it natural that you are wearing it? By the way, you are really into this, even wearing a mask when home alone.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The man in the opera mask smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was smiling despite a gun being aimed at him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was this person crazy?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom cry!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;.......?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I made a joke because the atmosphere is too tense. This mask is scary, Mister Park.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park&#x2019;s hands trembled at the familiar voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I am Phantom. I didn&#x2019;t think that Mister Park would come directly to kill my men.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Shoot! T-This is the real Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park ordered the man to be shot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how great Phantom was, it was impossible for him to avoid bullets shot by dozens of people in this room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? It seems like your hobby is suicide.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom pulled a bomb switch from his pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he calmly said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pressing this will blow up the entire building. You didn&#x2019;t think I would come here without any preparations? If you still want to then shoot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park slowly raised his hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yes, Phantom was a person like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Don&#x2019;t shoot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How did you know I was going to attack this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have pretty competent hackers but I am above them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was an absolute lie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, he discovered the Yakuza&#x2019;s plan due to some events accidentally overlapping.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had created several dummy sites to recruit Phantoms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A few days ago, the traffic from Japan started to increase by dozens of times.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was suspicious and gathered information from the bug installed in the Yakuza&#x2019;s offices.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But there was nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he had to move to find out directly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then, by chance, he saw that one of the Yakuza members were buying a large amount of coffee and chocolate while watching them.</span></p><p><span style="">The conclusion was amazing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the place where the hackers belonging to the Hayabusa were working.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They bought a large amount of snacks since they would be working all day.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk caught this scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A hacker who has great skills to not be caught on the Internet was caught in real life. This is why detectives collect evidence.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">After knocking out a member who was buying snacks. Tae-hyuk disguised himself as that member and infiltrated the team.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he heard Mister Park&#x2019;s plan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was simple after that.</span></p><p><span style="">He deliberately sprinkled information about the Phantoms and lured them here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuook... Y-Your purpose...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, this time I didn&#x2019;t come to fight. I just wanted to give you this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk handed an invitation to Mister Park.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Party?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Isn&#x2019;t it difficult to continue fighting each other? Come to the place written there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s invitation!&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park&apos;s hands trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah, who would go when it is likely to be a trap?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&#x2019;t have to come. Then do your best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and pressed the bomb switch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was an uproar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aaaaack! B-Bomb! Everybody get down!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park and the Yakuza members fell to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the bomb exploded.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t a powerful impact.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cough! Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park coughed as smoke seeped from different areas of the house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a smoke bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...D-Damn! C-Catch him! Catch Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park commanded his men with an agitated face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Phantom had completely disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom disappeared suddenly with the smoke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He only left one invitation behind.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park groaned as he looked at it.</span></p><p><span style="">The words, &#x2018;Mafia Game&#x2019; were written on it.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
