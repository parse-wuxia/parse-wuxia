<p>Chapter 113 - Jail War #5</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">There were some cases where a war was caused by really minor things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, just one sausage caused a war in prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden sat in his office and grabbed the few hairs that he had remaining.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;In just two days, the ingredients would&#x2019;ve arrived, and you would&#x2019;ve had a normal meal again. But you couldn&#x2019;t bear this much...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the warden was mistaken.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only the warden and prison guards who knew this fact, while the inmates didn&#x2019;t know when they would be allowed to have proper food again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How many people would be able to endure it and wait?</span></p><p><span style="">This place was a prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was divided between the inmates and the guards who managed them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guards could leave on a weekly basis to rest and recharge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, those imprisoned here wouldn&#x2019;t be able to leave until their sentence was over, or until they were released on parole.</span></p><p><span style="">For them, exercise time and meal times were the only moments they could relieve their stress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was all lost at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">The warden didn&#x2019;t consider the feelings of the prisoners at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he did, the the food poisoning incident and lack of food for a week might have ended up differently.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the warden thought of the prisoners as people who should be controlled and enlightened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The likelihood of him bending any other way was 0%.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, the situation is urgent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the deputy, who was carefully watching the warden, opened his mouth and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, the dining room and gallery are completely occupied.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I guess they are armed with cooking tools.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. But most of them are unharmed because there aren&#x2019;t many tools.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, they can&#x2019;t enter the warehouse because it is blocked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was fortunate from the warden&#x2019;s position.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warehouse contained weapons to prepare for any situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tear gas, gas masks, electric shockers, gas guns, etc...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is why I am authorizing the use of firearms in the prison. Isn&#x2019;t it the only way to end this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Although won&#x2019;t the human rights groups object?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like they are enjoying any freedom from their cells. Prepare to suppress them. All of them will be put in solitary confinement.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim... There are so many prisoners involved that there won&#x2019;t be enough room in solitary confinement.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden glared at the deputy and shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then increase it even more! At any rate, you have an hour and a half to quell them. I will take command.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Understood!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Number 974 was aligning his fingers in the dining room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuoooook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The task was done without anesthesia, so it was extremely painful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he went to the infirmary then he could receive proper treatment, but he would end up being beaten up by the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Number 974... Ah, I&apos;m sorry. That has become a habit. Park Joon-shik, please endure the pain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Park Joon-shik tried to forget about his pain by thinking about the target of his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Where is that bastard guard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t know...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik&#x2019;s treatment ended, although it was a bit rough.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Joon-shik looked around with torn clothes and a hand wrapped in a bandage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;He disappeared like a ghost. Obviously he was here...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Does this makes sense?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik glared at the guards tied up in one corner of the restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were those who saw the prison guard being assaulted and came to help.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But despite being armed with gas guns and rods, they couldn&#x2019;t help being overwhelmed by the huge difference in numbers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bound guards couldn&#x2019;t do anything but scream.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Joon-shik approached them and slapped one of the guard&#x2019;s cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where is the bastard who made my fingers like this!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The tied up guard shook his head desperately.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik spat and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Obviously he slipped away like a rat. Fuck, I was caught by a real goblin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik recalled the face of that guard with the evil smile.</span></p><p><span style="">He punched the guard with his fist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was the beginning of everything.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik approached Shin Chang-ho and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. What do we do now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho sighed as he looked at Park Joon-shik.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of his followers caused such a large incident...</span></p><p><span style="">Then the bodyguard next to Shin Chang-ho frowned and interrupted,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you saying that now? Grab a knife and handle it yourself. Don&#x2019;t rely on Hyung-nim all the time!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I am ashamed. Still, I couldn&#x2019;t bear it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you think it will be fine if you answer like that?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like a fight would break out among his own men.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho opened his mouth and spoke,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The dice has already been thrown. At the very least, we need to prepare for those here to have their punishments increased.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is okay. No matter what, going against the guards is too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If Hyung-nim tells me then I will go to hell for you. It is Hyung-nim&#x2019;s decision.</span></p><p><span style="">Dozens of eyes focused on Shin Chang-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Outside, he was part of a big gang but he was just a mere prisoner here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was limited in what he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, someone quietly walked up to Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kim Cheol-su?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? The cigarette seller?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he looked at the other person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The brawl had happened in the area where Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s gang was sitting. Most of them became involved in the fight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But why was this person here?&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, since when had he been here?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had disguised as a member of Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s group first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he became a guard to persecute the inmates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And now, he was here with Kim Cheol-su&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two groups here were dancing on the palms of his hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of this was possible with the help of his crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seem to have a lot of concerns.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho bit his lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A few years later, he would become a high-ranking official of the organization after leaving this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if he accidentally increased his sentence, would the boss wait for him?</span></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t possible to get rid of those who followed Shin Chang-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter what choice he made, he wouldn&#x2019;t like the results.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Shin Chang-ho didn&#x2019;t reveal that he was nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuk. Cigarette Seller, you seem to be very busy with your business. Did you come to this war to sell cigarettes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t know if you remember, but I said that I would cooperate with the war. It is the same again this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ha? You are very conscientious. I&#x2019;m sorry, but what we are dealing with now is the guards, not the Japanese. What you can do to help?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First, I will briefly sum up the situation. There are two things making you troubled right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. Speak.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First of all, the dining room we occupied is blocked to prevent the inmates from escaping. The key is kept among the guards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know that much. Isn&#x2019;t that why we are gathered here like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You want to finish this incident in a way that doesn&#x2019;t increase your prison time, but that isn&#x2019;t easy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the right answer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A small groan escaped from Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Knowing the latter, it meant that Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s psychology had been completely grasped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From now on, I will tell you what to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho gulped and looked at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Those who seek death shall live. Those who seek life shall die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Admiral Yi Sun-sin&#x2019;s words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have to make the war bigger in order to survive. I know there is something wrong with the prison ships, which is why the food hasn&#x2019;t been distributed properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. I also thought that. The warden seems to be doing something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the way of life. The wardens and guards do a lot of work that isn&#x2019;t publicized, so the warden will choose one of two options: He will either negotiate to cover up his problems, or call for outside support.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm! I would welcome the former with both arms open, but won&#x2019;t we be ruined if it is the latter?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The word &#x2018;we&#x2019; naturally flowed from Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed with satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then we will use the media to expose this incident to the outside world. South Korea is a really good country, so they care about the human rights of prisoners. The prisoners were given only porridge for a week and the guards carried out violence against the prisoners. They will end up squished like rice cakes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The former option of negotiation would benefit them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The latter option would incite sympathy from the public.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, there was a possibility that the result wouldn&#x2019;t turn out good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was possible to decrease the losses caused by the war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a sweet offer that was difficult to reject.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho said in a heavy tone,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But there is one big hole in your proposal. Take a look around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His companions were armed at best with rough cutlery and cooking knives.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Earlier, the fight could be won due to the overwhelming difference in firepower; however, once we leave here, dozens of armed guards would be waiting. The plan will only work if we can fight them equally. It is impossible...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly pulled out a set of keys.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could leave the dining room with it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...H-How did you get that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I told you. I will cooperate in this war. I will provide the materials.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Materials?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I got this by chance. There is some very interesting stuff mixed in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk found one key and showed it to Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oh my god! T-That&#x2019;s the weapons warehouse key!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dozens of members of Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s gang gulped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was possible to become the same as the armed guards with this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now you know what I mean by cooperating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho nodded quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-Amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim! There are a lot of batons and tear gas canisters in here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Taser guns and gas guns!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is enough to arm all of us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho watched quietly as his men picked up the things stored in the weapons warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard at the entrance had been hit with an iron pipe that Cigarette Seller found somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And he showed them a magic trick where he opened the door that was locked with iris recognition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;He truly isn&#x2019;t an ordinary criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cigarette Seller was twirling his iron pipe around.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you need any weapons from here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m more comfortable with this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The skill with which you handle that is unusual.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thanks for the praise. Anyways, this war can absolutely be won if we drag out the time. Build a fortress </span><span style="">inside the prison. But I&#x2019;m a bit bored so I&#x2019;ve prepared some fun games during that time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Games?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First, we will support each other to get what we both want. This won&#x2019;t end with just you guys being armed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see what you mean. I want to show a bitter taste to the Japanese.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I would also like you to give me Park Sung-yul in this bargain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And after the war, I will let you know where your sister is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Any laughter on Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s face disappeared at his words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He remembered what he had forgotten for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did Cigarette Seller know for certain where she was?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I can find my sister with your help, then I will do anything for you. There are many things to be done.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;If there is nothing else then go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled like he knew the ending of the story.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His men finished arming themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho took a deep breath and slowly walked forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;From now on, we will be at war with the guards. Don&#x2019;t overdo it, since time is on our side. For our victory!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The armed prisoners cheered.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the signal for the start of the prison war.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
