<p><span style="">Chapter 130 - Mister Park&#x2019;s Identity #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">As they followed the path that Phantom marked on the path, they didn&#x2019;t see many believers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the perfect escape route.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk once again marvelled at Phantom&#x2019;s abilities.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But what will happen to Song Chi-hyun sunbae?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wasn&#x2019;t he caught by the believers?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we don&#x2019;t have his magic tricks, then in the future... What will we do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t worried about Song Chi-hyun&#x2019;s safety.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were just colleagues, so it was none of their business if he was caught.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would easily betray each other in order to live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was an appropriate relationship for partners in crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Forget about that magician. Anyways, it is enough if we just show a few tricks once in awhile. Plus, we have Phantom&#x2019;s skills. Try to imagine it. Phantom appearing before the public.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa! There will obviously be a tremendous response.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It will be the greatest hit ever, beyond a jackpot. Ohuhu... This time we won&#x2019;t receive Oyabun&#x2019;s help, so let&#x2019;s try hard from the beginning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk recalled Phantom&#x2019;s absurd abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His know-how and Park Bum-ho&#x2019;s story. What if it was accompanied by Kim Jin-woo&#x2019;s production?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was obvious that the public would go crazy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just imagining it caused a smile to appear on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once that happens, thousands of people won&#x2019;t be a problem. Perhaps tens... No, it will be hundreds of thousands of people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk felt a twitch in his chest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt tremendous expectations towards the future.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Bum-ho looked closely at the escape route on the map and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We just need to turn right there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If they crossed the wall in front of them, then a car would be waiting on the other side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once they rode it, they could get out of this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their short escape was reaching the end.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk looked at the home of &#x2018;Sun&#x2019;, where he had stayed for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo... I didn&#x2019;t know it would end up this way. Anyway, right now I am running away. Just wait. Within a year, I will create a group large enough to swallow Sun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jin-woo listened to his words and agreed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I hope so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We are going to be legends. Hahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He stepped on the Park Bum-ho&#x2019;s hand and climbed the wall first.&#xA0;Next,</span><span style="">&#xA0;it was Kim Jin-woo&#x2019;s turn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the two people pulled Park Bum-ho up on the wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In a flash, the three people had crossed the wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a proficient move that thieves were capable of.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think that is the car that Phantom mentioned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Bum-ho pointed to a medium sized sedan that was parked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was so waxed that the car could be used as a mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">A big man in a black suit opened the door of the car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had short cropped hair and black sunglasses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyone looking at him would think he was a gangster.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you sure he is the driver?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they approached, the driver asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you Cho Min-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I heard there would be three people with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk shook his head and explained,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;One person unfortunately...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, three is good enough. Then get in the car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They quietly nodded and boarded the car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The driver climbed into his seat and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you please put on your seat belts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, um. Right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After confirming that their seat belts were on, the driver added,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoops, I forgot the most important thing. Would you like to have this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pulled out something shiny and threw it into the backseat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Handcuffs!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk, who had been treated as a gangster, turned back to them and declared,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am arresting you for murder, imprisonment, assault and drug trafficking! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. &#xA0;You have the right to an attorney and to have the attorney speak for you when asked a question. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&#x2019;t put it on then I will help you directly. What do you want to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-We are innocent...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah, I really got lucky. The prosecutor&#x2019;s office was paying attention to the movements of the Sun group. Then evidence was found. Sun&#x2019;s code of conduct doesn&#x2019;t allow for deserters does it? If someone tries to desert, then aren&#x2019;t they killed? Ah, don&#x2019;t worry. I have the evidence right here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, the person who gave it to me asked me to tell you this. Make sure to put you in a religion free prison. I did as he asked, so the place where you will be staying is decided. Do you know the Black Tortoise Prison? You can work hard at your religious activities there. Then who knows? Maybe you can go to heaven.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk struggled to get out of the car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the seat belts couldn&#x2019;t be removed no matter what they did.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I placed glue on the joints so it can&#x2019;t be taken off unless a special solvent is used. Then I will drive you to your destination comfortably.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom... That bastard tricked me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk cursed his unseen opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Phantom hadn&#x2019;t spoken any lies.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Being locked up in prison was the easier way to escape from the Yakuza&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk and his bishops were arrested by Cho Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made his way down the road like it was an eight lane highway.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the remaining people were a problem.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They found out about the leader&#x2019;s deceit and discovered that Sun was a cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Still, the atmosphere didn&#x2019;t quite dissolve.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A person who was exceptionally faithful and who was the representative of the believers climbed on stage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He grabbed the microphone and told the believers,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of you are free to return home. But although the leaders were fake, I believe that the teachings of Hwanin are real. Hwanin is an existence that clearly exists. He might&#x2019;ve been used as part as a scam, but once he knows that we are waiting, I believe that Hwanin will come down from the sky to save us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aye! I&apos;ll wait!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Me too! I was born again because of Hwanin! Even though the impostor blurred his name, Hwanin really exists in the world!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">More than half the believers responded to the representative&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t everyone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Che! Another one... What Hwanin...? I&#x2019;m going home. Jang-ssi as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can go home but I will stay here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The representative holding the microphone raised his voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All those who want to leave are welcome to. We won&#x2019;t oppress any deserters. Just remember Hwanin&#x2019;s teachings. Wait for him as well. It is free to enter and leave.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the believers divided into two groups.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips at the sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is why I only got 300 affinity points. In the end, I can&#x2019;t save the people who have already fallen into the mud.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Only 30% returned to their homes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The remaining members renamed themselves &#x2018;Dawn&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A new cult was born.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed and mixed among the people who were leaving.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a familiar face was seen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once Tae-hyuk approached, Lee Gun-woo clearly knew him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, this cool face... P-Phan...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised a finger to his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Lee Gun-woo nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Thank you for saving me! Greet him as well. This is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Min-young was pulled over by Lee Gun-woo and reluctantly bowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for helping me regain my mind. I really appreciate it, Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was decided that they would leave Dawn and return home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk touched the Phantom mask hidden on his body and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I was able to fool them thanks to you. So how long do you have left? I hope you finish your remaining military life well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo&#x2019;s eyes widened at Phantom&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had harsh memories of the military.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he wasn&#x2019;t like Lee Gun-woo, whose life was twisted due to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait. Won&#x2019;t I get a draft notice next year? I have to experience the army twice... Ah...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk was thinking about the unpleasant memories, Lee Min-young said to him,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&#x2019;t the best place, but can I please get your signature?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. It isn&#x2019;t that hard. Do you have a paper or pen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oppa, do you have a pen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... The rare opportunity to get the Phantom&#x2019;s autograph...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Min-young shook her head with a grim expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;By the way, do you want to see a magic trick?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The next evening.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had set up a trap to catch Mister Park and wanted to make sure that all of the preparations were correct.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm, the cameras and mikes are perfect. The boss is resting well in the warehouse... Now Mister Park just needs to come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was disguised as Cho Min-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk contacted him urgently stating there was a problem.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All the goods and personnel needed to operate Sun were supplied by Cho Min-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t strange to meet this way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, he needed to find out Mister Park&#x2019;s identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he would take measures against the Yakuza.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The appointment time was 6 o&#x2019;clock.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Exactly one minute remained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk finally looked at his face in the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same face as Cho Min-hyuk, so even his biological parents wouldn&#x2019;t recognize him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, I&#x2019;m strangely tense...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At best, he was just meeting with one of the Yakuza&#x2019;s subordinates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he felt something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the same as what I felt when I found Yoo Cheol-ho and realized that my memories of the future were real.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was obvious that Mister Park would have a bigger influence on him than Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The door opened and a man in his 40s entered the cafe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The cafe had a CLOSED sign so it obviously wasn&#x2019;t a passing customer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This meant...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Exactly 6 o&#x2019;clock. I&#x2019;m not late. You wanted to meet me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at him blankly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he was so surprised since gaining the future memories.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An unexpected person was standing in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Zombie? No, ghost? Or twins?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The name of the other person unknowingly fell in a whisper from Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Park Jung-hwan...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In his &#x2018;past life&#x2019;, Tae-hyuk was framed for killing him and received the death penalty.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama said that he died two years ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that Park Jung-hwan was now grinning in front of Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
