<p><span style="">Chapter 115 - The Price of their Sins #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The warden was drinking coffee in his office with a relaxed look.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...In this situation, I should be a calm commander.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden drank his cold coffee with trembling hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although there was some small problems, this was still a prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to access different areas, the prisoners needed to go through serious security.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the prisoners were occupying the cafeteria.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Soon, there would be a strike to suppress them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He muttered like he was trying to reassure someone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no problem... Just a little trouble. The opponents at best only have a few kitchen knives... If a properly armed squad moves then all of them can be put in solitary confinement.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he looked at the phone on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A phone number was showing on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he pressed the call button now, then he could ask for support.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was something that he absolutely couldn&#x2019;t do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could lose everything that he had done in the meantime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden unknowingly sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He drank what was left of the coffee and leaned back in his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time for his subordinates to report.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that time, someone opened the door and came rushing in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Warden-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The deputy took deep breaths to recover from his run.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Have you finished assembling the squad?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That isn&#x2019;t the problem right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What other problem has occurred?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The deputy paused like he was afraid of the warden&#x2019;s reprimand before speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The prisoners have occupied another area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?! No, how is that possible...? This is a prison. They have to go through a lot of security to get to another area! How are those bastards...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Depending on the security level, all access to other areas were strictly controlled in Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even the guards who managed the prisoners weren&#x2019;t allowed to freely enter unauthorized areas.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now the prisoners had managed to pass through into another area?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t make sense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It has been confirmed that the prisoners have escaped from the dining room and have occupied other areas. Maybe an excellent hacker is among them...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that a joke? Hacker? Are we filming a 007 movie?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The security of Blue Dragon Prison consisted of an access card, iris recognition and password.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if one was leaked, it was impossible to go to another area because they didn&#x2019;t have the remaining two.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what was this?</span></p><p><span style="">The warden rubbed between his brows and suppressed his boiling anger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had already happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he found that it was due to a mistake by a guard then he would severely penalize them later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The most urgent thing was to solve the problem in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I understand. So where are the prisoners now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden&#x2019;s chest tightened as he saw the deputy&#x2019;s face turn darker.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I won&#x2019;t be angry at the answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That, r-right now, warehouse two...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;F-Fuck! What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden flipped out within five seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">He banged his desk with his fist and shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...The warehouse was robbed?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It truly didn&#x2019;t make sense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Warehouse Two contained things that the inmates absolutely couldn&#x2019;t touch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The security level was much higher than anywhere else.</span></p><p><span style="">The deputy gulped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the words that the warden didn&#x2019;t want to hear emerged from his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, the prisoners have armed themselves with weapons from there. Around 30 people are involved... That is almost identical to the number of guards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeeeeeugh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, the warden would&#x2019;ve tried to compromise to some degree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If two groups with a similar power engaged in a war, then damages would occur.</span></p><p><span style="">But the warden decided not to compromise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His eyes were bloodshot and filled with madness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Deputy. I just came up with a good operation. Stop all ventilation in the prison right now and fill it up with tear gas. It is best to light a fire at the entrance to catch the raccoon hiding in a cave. How is it, my operation?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What You don&apos;t like it? Then tell me if you have a better idea!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry, but all the tear gas was kept in Warehouse Two.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, the tear gas was in the hands of the prisoners.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, we have the disadvantage in firepower.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The deputy nodded without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="">The warden sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the situation was this bad, he should ask for support from the outside, even if it meant revealing his guilt.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t do that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These drugs needed to be delivered to the Triads in China.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If this failed...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the warden made a choice that should never have been made.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik returned to the control room while twirling the bloody scissors around his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung-nim, I&#x2019;ve completed what you ordered safely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Um. You went through a lot of trouble. It took longer than I thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahaha~ I wanted it to be certain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik handed over some notes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho skimmed through it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um. The identity of the victims and the killing method. Even the place where the bodies were disposed... it is all here. Well done.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. There were 14 people so it was hard to write it all down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;14 people... I knew he was crazy, but this is a little much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho smacked his lips together.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik had written down the memoir of a serial killer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know why Cigarette Seller wanted this but he was very interested.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho licked his lips and moved his gaze to the notebook.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s see who the poor people were. The first victim was the daughter of his boarding house owner who he had a grudge against. And...&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden the door, the door of the warehouse opened and an agitated person ran in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho put the notebook away in a drawer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although he was curious about the contents, that wasn&#x2019;t important right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He waited for the report of this subordinate as calmly as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim! There is a problem!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think the warden has gone crazy. He is preparing for an all-out war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah... Crazy... Does he want to die together? It is the worst choice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho had been a prisoner here for a few years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there were those who were well-versed in the environment of Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Right now, there are only 30 guards on duty... We have an advantage just looking at power. Moreover, there is the information that the Cigarette Seller passed on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The prisoners didn&#x2019;t lack anything compared to the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">Shouldn&#x2019;t the warden be preparing for negotiations rather than war?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like pouring oil on a fire.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...After one or two armed conflicts, the war will return to a lull again. Then the situation will be on our side...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, his subordinate interrupted him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t all. The warden has brought the Chinese inmates to his side. There are at least 60 of them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck! He must be crazy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">He tried to stay as calm as possible, but he couldn&#x2019;t do that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warden was making a gamble.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prisoners had robbed a warehouse so now he was arming prisoners to fight on his behalf?&#xA0;</span><span style="">There would be massive repercussions if this leaked out.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s hands trembled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if the armed forces were the same, there was a difference in power due to the participation of the Chinese people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even Yi Sun-sin, who led a legendary victory in the Japanese invasion, wouldn&#x2019;t be able to win.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s brain moved quickly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no time to hesitate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter who won, both the prisoners and guards would be left with huge wounds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Should I bring in other prisoners?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Apart from the prisoners who followed Shin Chang-ho, a massive number of criminals were imprisoned in Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he joined hands with them to fight the Chinese inmates...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...No. There are no benefits we can give them to fight with us. Damn. Is this the end? I&#x2019;m guessing there will be at least three years added...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Time passed by without a solution.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a prisoner standing outside screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a group of armed prisoners on the drill grounds! It seems like this area is their goal!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho muttered with a desperate expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The guards and prisoners are holding hands so it is impossible to cope with out power alone... Hah! We can&#x2019;t even fight properly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The prison war created by the sausage seemed to end with the defeat of the prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, just like in any war, there was always a reversal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, should I prevent that guy from entering here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cigarette Seller?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He appeared in front of Shin Chang-ho after completely disappearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and pulled out a cigarette from his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you tell me an interesting story, then I will sell it. Oh, the fire will be a bonus along with the cigarette.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho gulped and looked at Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His words didn&#x2019;t make sense.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For reference, don&#x2019;t use anything like a lighter. If you&#x2019;re a man then you should use this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk indicated to the large plastic case next to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Inside there were several cans, electrical wires and plastic bags with liquid.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, this? A bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wind up this wristwatch and the bomb will explode after 30 seconds. Turning it off is impossible, so please avoid doing so unless you&#x2019;re absolutely sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is the blast force?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know exactly, but it can blow away this area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho gulped and looked at Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a bomb that would deal considerable damage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t miss even the smallest of information.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The allied forces will start soon. The installation of the bomb shouldn&#x2019;t be too late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Then I will ask you one last thing. Is this safe?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&apos;s see?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If they installed the bomb incorrectly, then they would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prisoners standing nearby gulped as they heard the conversation between the two.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, if they were ordered to install the bomb then they would do so.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they didn&#x2019;t want to do it.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho opened his mouth like he read the atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys. I&apos;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t want to concede such a wonderful role. I will install the bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hyung-nim!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Boss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ignored the people filming a noir movie in real-time and quietly escaped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho would use the bomb to buy time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, he had other work to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;m so busy that there should be two of me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used Spying to confirm that no one was nearby before using Disguise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he looked in the mirror, then he would be the perfect image of the warden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was simple to change the clothes he was wearing using Counterfeit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I really don&#x2019;t care which side wins. I just wanted the warden to come out of his cage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Upon arriving at the room, the deputy greeted him in a loud voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Warden-nim! Didn&#x2019;t you leave? Why are you suddenly...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I forgot something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, is that so? Then keep up the good work!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded and went inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a phone on the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hoh, the warden must&#x2019;ve had a lot of thoughts. Is that the number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&apos;s purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">He was going to shatter the Blue Dragon Prison itself.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
