<p><span style="">Chapter 77 - Doll Play #3 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The thugs spread out to the orphanages all over Seoul according to Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s order.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang Han-seong yelled at those who tried to go empty-handed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you just go there and ask for strange things, then they will be suspicious. Go buy a box of vitamin drinks and pretend you came for a volunteer activity. Go clean the toilets, play with the children, and gently squeeze out the information you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung-nim&#x2019;s plan is truly smart!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong didn&#x2019;t become of the leaders of this gang just due to his fighting skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also had a surprisingly good head.</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters bought vitamin drinks and headed over to the orphanages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their excuse worked well because they were high school students.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you here to do volunteer work?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I am a student from D High School.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The staff member sent him a suspicious look, but nodded after seeing the student ID.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What we need is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m happy to do anything, I will even clean the toilets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? I see. Please do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a few moments.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Student! You are more sincere than you look. Please eat these snacks and rest a little bit. I&#x2019;ll take four hours of volunteer work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah! Thank you. By the way, how long has Noona been here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the gangsters started collecting their information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s plan, it was surprisingly easy to gather information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The data piled up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Boss. This is an interim report.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Where should I look?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong laid out a map of Seoul that had been marked in advance before explaining each one. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are a total of 44 orphanages in Seoul. These 30 places are where the search is finished, and the rest will be finished soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So how many people are missing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That... It is a bit strange. In most orphanages, the children run away just as they are about to leave that place. I arranged the dates and that was the common point. It is the same for each of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk touched his chin and thought of Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s investigation.</span></p><p><span style="">There was one thing that caught his attention.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then why wasn&#x2019;t it reported?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The reason is mostly similar: The children would leave soon anyway. The police didn&#x2019;t really listen since they were just orphans. There are hundreds of children who go missing in one year.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police in South Korea were only concerned with the disappearance of children who have parents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But they were orphans living in a facility.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s wait for the rest of the reports to come in before making a conclusion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After three hours, all the information from the orphanages had been gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the conclusion was that children disappeared from 40 of the 44 orphanages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was a huge number, when taken as a percentage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was no one who went to the orphanages to investigate the missing people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was the same person. Perhaps they didn&#x2019;t investigate properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. Then it is a total wipe out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters found out when the children had disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">They did a better job than he expected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a bundle of 50,000 won banknotes and handed it to Kang Han-seong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a huge five million won.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Think of it as a reward. You did a better job than I thought. However, don&#x2019;t think about taking that money alone but distribute it. I&#x2019;m looking forward to your work in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thank you. Boss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It might be an over-investment, but Tae-hyuk shouldn&#x2019;t spare on the carrots when he was trying to attract rabbits.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now Kang Han-seong would try to accomplish whatever Tae-hyuk wanted with more effort.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong got up from his seat with an impressed face and went outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Tae-hyuk stayed to look at the map alone, he found something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He took out a pen from his pocket and marked from the oldest one who went missing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was an amazing result.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a little off, but there was the shape of a circle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible to do without someone being involved.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...They aren&#x2019;t disappearances. It is a serial kidnapping of over 40 children. Obviously, one of those victims is Kim Soo-bin...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin had been kidnapped relatively later, but if her severed arm had been found, the rest of the children...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt dizzy as he realized the ridiculous truth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wake up Seo Tae-hyuk. There must be some clues.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slapped his cheeks with both hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There had to be something in advance to signify such a massive kidnapping spree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to find out what it was.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used Voice Modulation.</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s voice was the best for this type of thing.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk called the orphanage that had the first missing person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the voice of a middle-aged woman was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello? I am a welfare officer from the Department of Health and Welfare in Gangseo-gu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, thank you for your hard work.</span></i> <i><span style="">Did something happen?</span></i></p><p><span style="">The voice of the woman receiving the call was strangely flirtatious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed to be due to Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s voice, who was popular among middle aged women.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Due to a recent incident, there is a child-welfare related rebate occurring. I wanted to contact you to see if anything unusual happened on October 7th.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">At that time?</span></i> <i><span style="">Can you please wait a moment?</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll find the records.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It worked really well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Bum-soo acted as a king in historical dramas, as his profound voice gave a strange sense of trust.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There were no visitors that day, but there was a health checkup at T Medical Centre on that day.</span></i> <i><span style="">Are you referring to this?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;T Medical Centre...?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, that&#x2019;s right. Thank you for the answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is it something that will cause the orphanage to be damaged?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course not. Don&apos;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk called a different orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time he just asked if they visited T Medical Centre on that day.</span></p><p><span style="">After he finished calling all the orphanages, Tae-hyuk sighed and leaned back in his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...All of them went missing shortly after a checkup.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no evidence but he could feel it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like I need Big Mama&#x2019;s help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Only one small piece remained to reach the truth that nobody had revealed yet.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk and Hyun-ho were discussing this incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well I think the killer if a very meticulous person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho stared blankly at Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae. Didn&#x2019;t I say that three days ago?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I haven&#x2019;t finished speaking yet. Listen. At any rate, we have been looking for clues or witnesses by mobilizing the media, and there has nothing so far. There was a plausible tip about a man wearing a mask that bought a saw, tarp, and plastic container. However, the payment was made in cash, and he moved in a position where he wasn&#x2019;t caught on CCTV, so we can&#x2019;t identify him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. Is the store far away from the crime scene?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Completely different cities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That certainly sounds suspicious...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were no witnesses and no clues.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Kang-suk stood up and beat on his chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No matter how trivial the clue is, it is our job to squeeze out as much as possible. If the police gives up, then the case will remain forever unsolved. I want to solve this case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been a long time since the appearance of Senses Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is something strange lingering in my mind. The other day, didn&#x2019;t you tell me about an avant-garde performance using dolls? The artist changed the arms and legs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did I say that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You certainly did. And there was one person who said something similar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;God of Crime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho laughed bitterly at the unexpected name.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He said that this was playing with dolls. Obviously, the police are calling it the Christmas Tree Mutilation murders.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Doll play?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The arms and legs of people were cut off and used to decorate a Christmas tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they switched the focus to dolls, then there was definitely someone who gave such a performance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The name of that person was...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The doll artist you talked about the other day. I did some research on the Internet. Here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk showed him the Internet screen on his phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were some photos of the famous person and his work.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hup...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The doll&#x2019;s arms and legs were cut off and switched to create a bizarre atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is it? Similar?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa. Once again, I think that Sunbae&#x2019;s senses are really great!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, this isn&#x2019;t evidence that he is the killer. It might simply be coincidence or a copycat. But isn&#x2019;t it worth visiting once?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want to go together now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it has been on my mind for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Interestingly enough, the two people had been investigating together since the hippo incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho worked in the office to grasp the psychology of the criminal with the collected evidence, while Detective Kang-suk was the opposite.</span></p><p><span style="">A detective whose career was in fieldwork.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He judged everything through seeing it and touching it directly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it was a little inefficient, most of the time he had great results.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the two of them had opposite styles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, they strangely worked well together.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, let&#x2019;s just talk to him to get his opinion first. You can show that you suspect him of being the criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aish, Sunbae. I&#x2019;ve been working in the field for seven years. I won&#x2019;t do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Okay. Then shall we call a taxi?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can go in my car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="">Having a car made things much easier than he thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he got married then he would buy a car...</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ha-ran&#x2019;s face popped up, causing Kang-suk to cough.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like it. This is the workshop of the doll artist, Yoo Ho-jin. By the way. It is quite unique.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a building with a pastel roof and pink bricks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like looking at a doll house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk laughed as soon as he got out of the car and saw the name on the nameplate.</span></p><p><span style="">[Doll House]</span></p><p><span style="">It was a really fitting name, and &#x2018;the place for my beloved dolls&#x2019; was written in fine print.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The artist seemed to be living a doll-like life here.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk carefully knocked on the door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A cracked and barren voice, like a broken vinyl record, was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho Kang-suk from the Gangdong Police Station. Sorry, but are you Master Yoo Ho-jin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s right. What is going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a thin man in his early 40s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The door opened slightly and a cracked hand, that was like bark, protruded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was a bizarre incident, and I heard that Master-nim was an expert in dolls, so I was hoping to get your opinion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled his police badge from his pocket and showed it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s eyes peered at them from between the gap in the door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you bring a warrant?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but not yet since I visited personally.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m busy because of work. Can you come back later?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At those words, Yoo Ho-jin tried to close the door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kang-suk was faster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He stuck his feet in the door and then literally forced it open.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing? The police barging into my home...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It will only take a short time... heok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk groaned as he entered the house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a ridiculous scene inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...D-Dolls?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were dozens of cut off arm and legs from dolls.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were glass beads rolling around on the work table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Looking closer, they were the eyeballs of the dolls.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a large stainless steel saw on the ground among doll pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Yoo Ho-jin shouted with an upset face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You entered my workshop without permission! This is obviously a home invasion!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho picked up one of the doll arms and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae. This is a doll.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a plastic tub filled with what seemed to be doll heads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk was confused.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no evidence of any mutilated humans in the workshop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was his feeling wrong?</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s face was red with anger,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Master-nim. I&#x2019;m sorry but could you take a look at these photos?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, I mean get out of here right now... Um...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s expression changed when Kang-suk showed him a photo of the Doll Play scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a murder scene that I am in charge of. Doesn&#x2019;t it resemble your work?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin&apos;s mouth twitched,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The atmosphere is certainly quite similar. It is like what I am pursuing, and is why you can&#x2019;t help but be suspicious. After seeing my workshop, do you understand that I work with dolls instead of people? Then get out right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s voice had softened.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">Looking at the tools in the workshop, it must&#x2019;ve been doll artist Yoo Ho-jin who bought the tools at the store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So was it really unrelated to dolls?</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he heard a&#xA0;thumping sound&#xA0;from the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk confirmed that Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s expression instantly changed.</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered seeing such a look before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Criminals gave such responses after their hidden weapons were found.</span></p><p><span style="">Then...</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk grabbed Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s arm and asked in a quiet voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Master-nim. Do you have a basement here?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
