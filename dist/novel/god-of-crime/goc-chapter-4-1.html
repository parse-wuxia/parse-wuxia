<p><span style="">Chapter 138 - Everybody Gather! #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">From now on, it was the time to talk about secrets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What would happen if he hadn&#x2019;t used &#x2018;Spying&#x2019;?</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of passing by, the person was outright listening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The spy only heard a few keywords, but it was lucky that Tae-hyuk noticed them now.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It isn&#x2019;t a guard. An inmate? That means...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This place was a deserted corner of the maintenance room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No inmate would bother to come to such a place.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;A spy planted by someone. The purpose is to monitor the Bomber?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung had the best bomb-making ability in this country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In terms of public awareness, he was inferior to Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, any criminal organization would drool over him.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk touched the gun that he had hidden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Bullet Time had to be activated with a firearm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would work even if bullets weren&#x2019;t loaded or the safety device was still on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Now, let&#x2019;s check who the informant is.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The person scratched his head and walked out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did I listen to something that I shouldn&#x2019;t have?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? Yoo Cheol-ho?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth curved upwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Due to the tunnel that Yoo Cheol-ho had dug, he had been able to work freely in Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had forgotten to return the favor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But they met again this way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I happened to accidentally hear you talking while working nearby... But I just came and didn&#x2019;t hear anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your saliva increases when you lie. I know that there was no work scheduled in this area today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho smiled and whispered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But Guard-nim spoke a very interesting story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a lie that he hadn&#x2019;t heard anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You really did hear it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! My ears are a little sharp so I couldn&#x2019;t help hearing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what did you hear?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, there is no need to hide it. Huhu, aren&#x2019;t you trying to help Kim Tae-sung escape from here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho spoke slyly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And that thing bulging at your waist. Isn&#x2019;t it a gun? It looks like a pistol loaded with bullets, rather than a taser gun. Certainly, I don&#x2019;t think any guards would carry something like that around. Therefore, you are someone pretending to be a guard in order to help Kim Tae-sung escape.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s reasoning was correct.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As expected from the person who boasted that he was a genius when it came to escaping.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t they say that bodies can&#x2019;t talk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend that method. I wouldn&#x2019;t do it if I was in Guard-nim&#x2019;s position.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you shoot a gun here, then the people in the building will hear and come rushing. Then Guard-nim&#x2019;s plan will be disrupted. In addition, I am also interested in a jailbreak. I know a few bits of information. What is the difference if two people escape instead of one? Besides, I am confident in my hard work. I will be a well-behaved person who listens to your words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to join the team.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I don&#x2019;t need to use a gun to suppress you. It looks like you have confidence in your physical strength. But I have this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk reached into his pocket and pulled out a rusty iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho was surprised to see such an object emerging from a person&#x2019;s clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A moan emerged from his mouth at the seemingly impossible action.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huheok! W-Where...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a simple trick. But your second reason is a little interesting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The middle of the jailbreak plan that Tae-hyuk set up needed a breakthrough.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had Bullet Time so he wasn&#x2019;t worried about getting hurt.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But if Kim Tae-sung got hurt, then the plan would be disrupted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I should check how plausible his jailbreak plan is.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu... Then can I join?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, first let me hear your plan first, Escape King.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! Escape King. That is a shameful title.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho asked with curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How do you do that? You look like the guard, but your body type is clearly different. Is it a special make up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately wore large clothing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But seeing through it meant that Yoo Cheol-ho had pretty good eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is why Yoo Cheol-ho is later known as the Escape King. Even so, Yoo Cheol-ho is still Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">A wicked smile appeared on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He came up with a plausible plan to use Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That isn&#x2019;t it. You can see from this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heok! M-My face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I am Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You won&#x2019;t be able to find God, Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A bright smile appeared on Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s face, like he had won the lottery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That person was surely Phantom!&#xA0;</span><span style="">Being on his team meant that he could really break out.</span></p><p><span style="">That was how Phantom, the Bomber, and the Escape King formed a team to escape from Red Phoenix &#xA0;Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk returned to his original disguise and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But there is one condition for you to join the team.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is the condition?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is because security is vital. Shouldn&#x2019;t we trust each other if we are to be working together?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho started nodding at the speed of 50 rpm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Of course. I absolutely won&#x2019;t reveal this to anyone. I will keep the secret, even if a knife was held to my neck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Good decision. Then I want to hear an answer: Why did you follow the Bomber? Don&#x2019;t say that you were cleaning here. Well, I think I already have a rough guess. Someone ordered you to watch Kim Tae-sung. What if you tell them the story of the jailbreak? So make a decision if you want to be on the same team. Phantom, or the one who gave the command to you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s eyes started shaking violently.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was evidence of extreme confusion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had heard a lot about Phantom&#x2019;s greatness but...</span></p><p><span style="">It was like he was a mind-reader!&#xA0;</span><span style="">Not only could he change his face at will, but he might be a real psychic.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho seemed to be conflicted, so Tae-hyuk decided to push him a bit more.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you leave here, then it won&#x2019;t matter. What do you have to worry about?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyak! That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho nodded as he made a decision and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. I will tell you everything I know. Yes, I clearly need to explain since we are on the same team now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled at Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho explained why he was watching Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...So that&#x2019;s what happened.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. In the end, it was the prison warden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are literally playing the role of a spy. What would&#x2019;ve happened if it entered the ears of the other inmates?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, I could escape from jail so it wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The party moved to a more discreet place before earnestly talking about the jailbreak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nobody will come to this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a tail this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&apos;ll listen to Phantom&#x2019;s plan first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plan was simple.</span></p><p><span style="">Red Phoenix Prison allowed one visitation day a week.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be helped since the island was far away from land.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;During the visits, most of the guards will be assembled together. You will use a disguise to break through the main entrance. Then you intend to steal the ship in the port and escape right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it is the simplest and best way to get out of here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho frowned and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, Phantom will be able to get out using this method. But there is a chance that Kim Tae-sung and I can be hit by a taser gun. Why don&#x2019;t we do something else instead?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s opinion was definitely valid.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One person could get out easily using that method, but it was a different story if there were more than two people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He should reduce the variables as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If there is a better plan, then I will listen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho started to talk about his plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, you should know the main feature of the Red Phoenix Prison. It isn&#x2019;t equipped with proper medical facilities. So if there is a seizure or serious injury, the person will be taken to a hospital on land to receive treatment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In other words, fake an illness.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a detergent that I packed in advance. After mixing it with water and drinking it, a person will look like they are foaming at the mouth. But with Phantom&#x2019;s power, isn&#x2019;t it possible to do a more plausible act? Furthermore, things will become easier if you disguise yourself as one of the transportation guards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho created a plan in a short amount of time that took into account Phantom&#x2019;s abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He truly was the Escape King.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The biggest drawback to the original plan is that the transportation would be handled by the guards. If Phantom is in charge, then we can leisurely escape once we arrive on land. You have the face-changing magic. Is it possible to change into anyone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, I need to meet them face to face and listen to their voice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The images of the guards working here passed through Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was definitely one guard in charge of transporting patients who was currently inside the building.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... If so, I know one of the right guards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Great. You thought of all this in a short amount of time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. It is an impossible plan without Phantom&#x2019;s abilities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho felt his whole body shaking with pleasure.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the first time he felt this way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was recognized by the great Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When is that person working?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He finishes today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s good. Tell me the name and I will go to steal his face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho gave the name of the designated guard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded and stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It will be lunch time soon, so let&#x2019;s finish up. We will meet here again in the afternoon when the morning work is over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung, who had been watching the two people from the side, nodded in response.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He intended to leave the escape to the two experts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;By the way, Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you going to do when you get out of here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I need to find the person who put me in here. I also want to find the high school brat who reported me. Then I&#x2019;ll slowly think about what to do next.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. I wish you good luck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, you bet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Humans didn&#x2019;t change easily.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho spoke as Tae-hyuk was leaving.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to be prepared. When is D-Day?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Day? Oh, you mean when will this jailbreak occur?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Preferably it should be this week...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk cut off Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fast was good, but this was a little too fast!</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
