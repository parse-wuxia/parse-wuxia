<p><span style="">Chapter 105: Pieces of the Puzzle #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Illegal Surgery was a skill that could do any type of surgery, given that he had the tools.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, even if a wound was treated with Illegal Surgery, it wouldn&#x2019;t be treated at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first glance, it seemed like a total useless ability.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the true value of Illegal Surgery lied in the &#x2018;Cancel&#x2019; ability that restored the area to its original state.</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to use it when he acquired the skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Well, it was an ability that was automatically learned when he became a Noble, just like &#x2018;Damage to Both Sides&#x2019;.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk rolled up his shirt and looked at his belly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An incision was made, and a plastic pack used for surgery was inserted inside. &#xA0;</span><span style="">He then used Cancel, and as if time had turned backwards, his belly returned to its original state.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I put a lot of medicines and things I need for the future inside the pack. If it was a bomb...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a skill that could make a literal walking bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That wasn&#x2019;t the only scary thing about Illegal Surgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The results of all surgeries were cancelled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same with amputation.</span></p><p><span style="">He cut off his toe and triggered Cancel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then an amazing thing happened in front of him, just like watching a movie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The toe he placed on his desk returned to its original place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only thing was that Cancel could only be used up to 60 minutes after a surgery was done.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Cutting my neck is impossible, but I can cut off my arms or legs.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a bizarre skill that allowed him to freely do things with the human body.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;First, I have to take this out.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Due to having something foreign in his body, it felt like he had indigestion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to get rid of it as soon as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to perform an incision, he needed tools such as a scalpel, tweezers, and a clamp.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had the Illegal Surgery skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was possible to cut it with something like a kitchen knife or scissors.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;But the problem is that this is a prison, not the outside world. There is no such thing available.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was natural that prisoners would be restricted in handling anything that could be used as a weapon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same with utensils like forks or chopsticks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Chopsticks sharpened using bricks could be used to hurt someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the same reason, pages from a notebook or shoelaces from shoes were removed.</span></p><p><span style="">But could he cut his belly with cutlery?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t an easy task.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had lived here for 10 years, so he knew more about the Blue Dragon&#x2019;s environment than the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First, I need a worker.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Worker referred to a person who took a job in prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Usually they were model prisoners or people who gave bribes to the guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew very well how to get close to one.</span></p><p><span style="">As he checked the wall clock, he saw that it was almost time for dinner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he would meet the prisoners here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was also a testing place for every newbie.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Beep!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The signal sounded and the firmly closed door opened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A guard with a rod entered and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Numbers 1047 and 747, it is time for your meal. Gather in the dining room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey Newbie. Huhu. Did you learn many things from this friend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I learned very thoroughly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kukuk! Don&#x2019;t be too scared. This is a place where people live.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike the warden, whom he provoked, he had to see the guards every day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, his answers would be as close to what they wanted as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to look like a moderately frightened newbie.</span></p><p><span style="">The guard looked at Yoo Cheol-ho lying on the bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He poked Yoo Cheol-ho with his rod and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, it is time to eat. Stand up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho was lying quietly without any movements.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was stunned due to being hit by an iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be hard for him to get up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the guard didn&#x2019;t know this and screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This bastard is completely crazy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard tried to pull back the blanket covering Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk said quietly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He told the other guard but I don&#x2019;t think his body is that good. I think he received a doctor&#x2019;s diagnosis to sleep for the rest of the day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Say that sooner you brat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard looked at Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s body with an annoyed expression before leaving the cell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the violent incidents in Blue Dragon Prison mainly took place in the dining room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was one of the few times that criminals of all nationalities gathered in the same space.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rule of don&#x2019;t touch other animals when eating didn&#x2019;t apply here.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered in a small voice so that the guard walking in front of him couldn&#x2019;t hear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s try the best way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The eyes of the prisoners eating at the tables shone as they saw the newcomer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, Newbie. Why is your face rotten?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve seen you on the 9 o&#x2019;clock news. What did you get caught for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did the kid bring a little spoon? If not, he will have to eat by hand. Kilkil.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t tease. Don&#x2019;t you remember how the newcomer last week was so frightened that he urinated himself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aish, that should happen with that face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ignored the other prisoners teasing him and went to the rationing area.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sarcastic remarks like these were already tedious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he reacted, then it would just become more severe.</span></p><p><span style="">As he walked forward with a plastic plate, a staff member wearing a hygiene mask gave him rice and various side dishes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it was the principle of quantitative food distribution, it was normally done at the discretion of the staff worker.</span></p><p><span style="">This was one of the reasons why prisoners wanted to become a worker.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the pancake and soup that he saw.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He watched the other prisoners receive the best food for a minute.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the worker passed him a note under the tray.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was so natural that he had obviously done it a lot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t deceive Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s Gambling skill that was well-versed in many tricks.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It seems like this guy is in charge of trading.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke in a small voice so that only the worker could here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to buy it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a gesture like he was holding a cigarette and paused.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The worker knew what it meant and smiled,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you a newbie entering today? If you can&#x2019;t suppress yourself now, what will happen in the future?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t what you think. Please sell it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, if you have money then I will sell it at any time. However, it is a bit expensive because this is an island.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk remembered that the price of cigarettes was around 20,000 won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he thought about how it could be purchased for 5,000 won at a convenience store, it was an exorbitant price.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;100,000 won for one pack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That sounds a bit expensive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t buy it if you don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he bargained here, then he could cut the price in half.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk needed to get what he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will buy 20 packs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, that is a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The worker gave a small whistle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the prisoners here were criminals who committed terrible crimes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike other prisons, there were few scammers or people who committed economic crimes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But buying 20 packs of cigarettes for 100,000 won?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was probably the first financier in a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">The stiff face of the worker relaxed and he gave a friendly smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are a newcomer so I&#x2019;ll let you know how we handle trades.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is no need as I&#x2019;ll pay in advance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled an envelope from his sleeve and extended it under the tray.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Criminals in prison were allowed a certain amount of money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was up to two million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After that, they could receive one million at a time through mail or money transfer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With that money, it was possible to buy things like snacks from the prison kiosk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The amount should be right. Please check it so I can receive the goods as soon as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu, understood. It will be ready soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even a prison on a remote island wasn&#x2019;t completely disconnected from the outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Many vendors brought in foodstuffs and there were goods sold at kiosks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was probably the best thing for the workers here.</span></p><p><span style="">The workers would bribe the contractors in order to bring some things into the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was mainly cigarettes, but sometimes there were psychotropic medicines and cutlery being smuggled in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the higher the risk, the more expensive it was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A newbie would be able to buy cigarettes, but it would take longer for anything else.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of course, they aren&#x2019;t necessary. I&#x2019;ll obtain everything with just cigarettes.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and bowed slightly.</span></p><p><span style="">There were many people here who couldn&#x2019;t buy cigarettes because they had no money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he gave them one pack then they would kill for him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rumour that there was a person who bought a huge amount of cigarettes spread quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at his plate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The menu of the day was miso soup, stir fried anchovies, radish kimchi, and soy sauce beef.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t bad because there was meat.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it because Tae-hyuk bought 20 packs of cigarettes?&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were two big lumps of meat on his plate.</span></p><p><span style="">He took it and sat in a vacant seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A hulking person who looked like he did martial arts sat across Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey Newbie. Do you know that you are famous?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The hulking person had nothing to say as Tae-hyuk smiled and picked up his spoon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I guess you are still used to homemade food. You should be glad that you were given decent food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said nothing before grabbing the oversize fist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the opponent&#x2019;s face distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuong. W-Why is this bastard so strong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Next time, it will be your crotch instead of your hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kuong, let go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He drew the attention of the other prisoners around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then someone deliberately poured a plate containing hot soup towards Tae-hyuk, which would literally burn the face.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;They aren&#x2019;t kids. If you want to harass me then you should do it right.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and grabbed the collar of the big guy sitting near him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the big guy sat in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s spot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a superhuman move that was only possible due to his agility.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-Ack! Hot, hotttt!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead of Tae-hyuk, the big person was the one hit by the miso soup.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guards watching from the entrance of the dining room cried out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other prisoner explained,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. My leg caught on the chair and I accidentally poured my soup as I slipped.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Take him to the infirmary right now! Don&#x2019;t cause any more problems for me today. Che!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The big guy walked out with a face covered in a cold towel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t forget to curse Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It looks like you have a bit of strength. I&#x2019;ll let you know who is in charge here. Just wait.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t the end of the newcomer&#x2019;s welcome.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eat some rice and soybeans.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">10 prisoners surrounded Tae-hyuk like he was a novelty toy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be difficult to expect the help of the guards if anything happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once Tae-hyuk saw the people gathered, he realized it was time for him to lay down his cards.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&#x2019;t have any money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What is this dog?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want some cigarettes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The criminals gulped since they knew that Tae-hyuk had bought 20 packs of cigarettes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they couldn&#x2019;t bend to a newcomer.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he noticed everyone watching him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no big person among here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At most, they were &#x2018;Commoners&#x2019;, those with a sentence that was shorter than three years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was easy to take care of those types of people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you do me a favor then I&#x2019;ll give you a cigarette.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is simple. I&#x2019;m too bored in here. You can get a cigarette if you tell me one of the funny stories that happens here. Isn&#x2019;t it a good deal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could hear gulps from around him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were prisoners who still had their pride even with no money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey Newbie. Are you crazy? Do you think we are beggars? If you keep talking like that then I&#x2019;ll make you eat glass powder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Glass powder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When finely grounded and put into food, the stomach would become a mess, and the person would bleed out and die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t easy to find glass in this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was even more so for those who didn&#x2019;t even have the money to buy cigarettes.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;In my 10 years of staying here, I&#x2019;ve only seen three people die from powdered glass.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then how about one story per pack? You don&#x2019;t have to if you don&#x2019;t want it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The eyes of the complaining prisoner changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt like he would be the first one to come and see Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, the cigarettes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were the beginning of his plan.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
