<p><span style="">Chapter 139 - Everybody Gather! #5</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho was excited as he was eating his meal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The moment he had longed for since entering prison was finally going to be realized.</span></p><p><span style="">The inmate sitting with him at the dining room asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did something good happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kukukuk, it isn&#x2019;t anything big. Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, today is the special meal day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were grilled ribs on Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s plate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a meal that only appeared twice a year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho picked up the meat with a spoon and placed it on the plate of the man who was slobbering.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;G-Giving this to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not hungry right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah... But it is grilled ribs. Well, if you are giving it to me then I will eat it well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He moved the spoon and started eating at a tremendous rate.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho chuckled in a low voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The ribs were so thick that it felt like chewing roots.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, this was still a luxurious dish in prison.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he would soon be able to get out of here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yes, this evening he would eat sirloin!&#xA0;</span><span style="">His smile stretched from ear to ear at the thought.</span></p><p><span style="">When he looked at the clock, it was time for the afternoon work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He went to the restroom, shaved neatly, and put on the cleanest clothes he had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After grabbing the detergent and a few camouflage tools, he was ready for the escape.</span></p><p><span style="">As today was visitation day, so the number of guards overseeing the work was much less than usual.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho could roam around more freely compared to other inmates so that he could keep an eye on Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who would think I would use it for escaping?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho muttered and headed to the place where he promised to meet Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were already people waiting when he arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry. I was a little late preparing some things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay. It is hard to keep the promised time in prison. You don&#x2019;t have watch or a phone to check.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho felt some doubts as he answered.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how he looked at it, Phantom... He seemed strangely familiar with prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surely he hadn&#x2019;t been a prisoner?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Aish, it couldn&#x2019;t be.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom had the abilities to avoid getting captured by the police.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then show me what you brought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Here it is.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho pulled out a bottle of water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It looked like paint had been released into the water.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung asked in a trembling voice after seeing it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I have to drink this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom can change his face, but that won&#x2019;t help us get out of here. You don&#x2019;t have to drink if you don&#x2019;t want to leave.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho wasn&#x2019;t interested in Kim Tae-sung and looked at Phantom instead.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but can I check the face? Oh, I don&#x2019;t doubt your abilities. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to make sure?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Just wait a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk changed his voice and face to the guard that he had targeted during lunch time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard was someone who treated Kim Byung-gun as his&#xA0;master.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is it? Is it the same?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh, oh my god... I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it if I hadn&#x2019;t seen it with my own eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an amazing ability, no matter how many times Yoo Cheol-ho saw it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He touched the face, but the texture was correct.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But it is hard to get out of here just with a guard. At the very least, the doctor&#x2019;s medical certificate and the warden&#x2019;s permission...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a piece of paper and showed it to Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...White paper?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he moved his palm over the paper.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had clearly been a blank piece of white paper, but now there were words written on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a medical certificate stamped with the seal of the doctor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We will leave on the ship today. And if the person in charge tries to check, I will copy the warden&#x2019;s voice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow, wow, it is perfect!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho looked at Phantom with respect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho only gave a brief overview of the operation, but Phantom was able to see through it and prepare a step further.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is your expertise, so you can check it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Wasn&#x2019;t this clearly blank just now? But how...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed more real than the real one.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s review the plan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s eyes were shining with the hope of getting out of here soon.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">A transport ship for visitors was docked at the port.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was strictly managed as a ship for visitors.</span></p><p><span style="">The guard in charge of the ship raised his hand as a familiar face approached.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a guard in uniform.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kim Sang-jin sunbae? Who are these prisoners?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, two people suddenly had epileptic seizures, so they are being sent to the hospital for treatment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. They are clearly suffering. Is that foaming I see at their mouths? Their eyes are also completely unfocused. This is truly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard clicked his tongue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk prepared to board the ship with the prisoners who were tied up together.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the guard asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I didn&#x2019;t hear about this in advance. Can you show me the official document and medical certificate? Ah, I&#x2019;m not doubting Sunbae, but I will be punished if I ignore official procedures.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk extended some papers to the guard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard, who thought his senior was about to scold him, sighed with relief.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you want me to call the warden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, the warden is busy. This is okay. Two prisoners suddenly having epileptic seizures... If there was one more, then wouldn&#x2019;t it be a complete curse? They came in separately, but will leave together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? Haha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put the two people in the prisoners quarters of the ship and locked the door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After some time, people started to board the ship.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were civilians returning from their visits.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, four extra guards boarded.</span></p><p><span style="">At the time of departure, one of the guards started checking the passengers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? These people are?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I allowed them on. They are being transported by Kim Sang-jin sunbae. I also got confirmation from the warden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is awkward to have prisoners in proximity of the guests. Make sure the civilians are unaware of it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then tell the captain to depart.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were 31 civilians, four guards, three sailors, and two criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the boat carrying Phantom started to sail.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">As the ship sailed without any problems, an incident occurred.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho and Kim Tae-sung, who had been locked inside, suddenly slipped out with hoods covering their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This ship has been hijacked!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The atmosphere wasn&#x2019;t clear so the passengers left their rooms to look.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;F-Fight?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What just happened?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Then someone discovered Phantom carrying a gun and screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack! G-Gun...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I won&#x2019;t do anything so please don&#x2019;t shoot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was currently Phantom wearing the opera mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He entered the steering room and told the sailors inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you follow my commands, then no one will be hurt! All of the ship&#x2019;s crew members and guards will gather in one place!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was broadcasted all over the ship.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The scattered guards panicked at the sudden incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They didn&#x2019;t think that Phantom had been hiding among the civilians.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Sunbae. A gun. Phantom is armed with a gun...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know! Fuck, he looked like a nice guy on TV. Hijacking a ship...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A white mask appeared before the two people who were talking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is the cool criminal? He is just a criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are armed with taser guns. It is a weapon that can be used against unarmed people. But I have this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He aimed the gun towards the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hik!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a bit cliche but it is fun. Hands up! If you move then I will shoot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom easily defeated the guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He gathered the passengers, guards and sailors in the middle of the boat.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, everybody is here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you going to do with us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Spare me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you listen to what I say then no one will get hurt. I guarantee it in the name of Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The passengers inwardly sighed with relief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the guards were different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If someone had to die then it would clearly be one of the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">Everybody on board was gathered here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was someone missing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;S-Sang-jin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They started to look for Kim Sang-jin who was responsible for transporting the prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two hooded people were clearly the prisoners...</span></p><p><span style="">One guard asked with a despairing expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom turned towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Kim Sang-jin? I&apos;m sorry, but I threw him into the sea for trying to rebel. Right now, fish are probably feasting on him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N-No!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, right now the real Kim Sang-jin was eating chicken and drinking cold beer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was forbidden to drink alcohol on the job, but sometimes it was necessary to survive on the island.</span></p><p><span style="">The guards on the ship didn&#x2019;t know this and were in shock.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They decided to follow Phantom&#x2019;s words and didn&#x2019;t rebel.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho followed him around like a dog chasing after its owner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom. I&#x2019;ve tied everyone up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the captain tied to the pole with the navigator shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Release us! If the ship continues this way then it will be completely off route!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I will be deciding the route from now on. By the time we arrive at the port, then the police will already be there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will steer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho asked him,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you steer a ship?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I&apos;ve never done it before, but I&#x2019;m sure I can do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As expected from Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had the Vehicle Theft skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It allowed him to steal anything with an engine and drive it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk left the hostages to Yoo Cheol-ho and went to the steering room.</span></p><p><span style="">The ship had followed the currents and was floating aimlessly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung was unfamiliar with this situation and asked with an anxious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The engine is off. Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The ship is mine now. Can&#x2019;t I freely control it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime skill: Vehicle Theft has been triggered.] </span></p><p><span style="">-This ship is now yours.</span></p><p><span style="">There was one drawback to the Vehicle Theft skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was that an embarrassing remark needed to be said to trigger it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What did you just say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just felt like I needed to say those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, Tae-hyuk stole the ship and headed somewhere else.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There was a frenzy at the port once the scheduled ship didn&#x2019;t arrive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The radio in the steering room started making loud sounds, so Tae-hyuk completely cut off the line.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the maritime police were dispatched.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the three criminals had already fled after abandoning the ship at another port.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It worked like a charm.</span></p><p><span style="">Vehicle Theft wasn&#x2019;t just about stealing the vehicle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After stealing the car, the person had to escape and avoid being detected by the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, there were two attributes attached to Vehicle Theft.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;One attribute can temporarily camouflage the stolen vehicle and the other one will boost the speed. With this, I would be able to escape from an army.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He used 20 points to raise these two attributes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In no time, he only had 30 affinity points left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The points were difficult to earn, but he used them so quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But it is worth learning them if I can arrive safely, so I won&#x2019;t begrudge it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho kissed the ground after succeeding in the prison break.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hahaha! Freedom! I am free!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You look like someone who has been locked up for 30 years.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! I am just happy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung looked around blankly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t seem to believe that he had escaped from jail.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho moved first.</span></p><p><span style="">He approached Phantom and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hehe, Phantom. Isn&#x2019;t it a shame to split up here? This is now a relationship. Shall we continue working as a team in the future? With my brains and Phantom&#x2019;s abilities, we will be able to eat up South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled at Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, he still had to take care of this guy.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
