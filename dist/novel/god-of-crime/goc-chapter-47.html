<p><span style="">Chapter 47: The Family&#x2019;s Condition #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s words contained a strange eloquence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He blended one lie among 10 facts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That way, it sounded like he was just telling the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">The contents of Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s words were simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Large corporations regarded their employees like slaves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, they bribed politicians to try to pass labour reform laws.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how hard someone worked, they could be thrown away like a used tissue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would never be rewarded for their efforts.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tiwai was different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By default, in order to join the company, a person had to purchase a certain amount of shares.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a relationship between an employer and employee, but one where everyone was an owner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there were tangible results, then their rating would go up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The higher the rating, the greater the distribution.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well, it sounds like a plausible story.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">It was no use if people were owners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the exploitation targets just changed to a higher grade.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Choi Sung-yeol was extremely good at cajoling the new members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were men and women next to him, all decoys planted by Tiwai.</span></p><p><span style="">The old people praised him by using their years of experience.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The young ones said they had a burning passion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were those who didn&#x2019;t have proper jobs, and were now living well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every one of them spoke words of praise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The praise, that was as smooth as butter, poured out of their mouths and were caught in the people&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">While the sense of confidence increased, the final blow was dealt.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they joined now, then they could go up to a higher grade.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could reach the status of other people, who had worked for a few years, in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">In that way, the participants were persuaded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Interviews with members of Tiwai were broadcasted on the screen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The attendees looked at the screen with flushed faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look at this. Many people are making more than five million a month. Are you willing to do that? Do you lack experience? Or is there a lack of enthusiasm?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A person who earned around 800,000 a month would become someone who earned more than 10 million won in the first three months.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A man, who said he was in his first year of employment, took out the key for a foreign car from his pocket and shook it.</span></p><p><span style="">Now everything was gathered for the perfect situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is like taking off the label and replacing it with one from a deluxe brand. Furthermore, that isn&#x2019;t a key no matter how I look at it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a fake made for use as a movie prop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was made elaborately so that it couldn&#x2019;t be distinguished from the real thing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had the ability to grasp the authenticity of an object, due to the Forgery skill improving his discerning eye.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wondered if he would receive a new crime skill and checked the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Um. There is no new skill.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">So far, Tae-hyuk had met seven blacklist members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, except for Big Mama, he didn&#x2019;t receive any of their crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it necessary to upgrade to Noble?</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;By the way, what is An Eun-jeong doing? She isn&#x2019;t a decoy?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She hadn&#x2019;t appeared with Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s party.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked around the meeting room and was able to find her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong was sitting in a corner and writing down Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s notes in a notebook.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She looked just like An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... They are truly family.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The other people were busy talking to each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat next to An Eun-jeong and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have been writing really hard. What is the content?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong laughed and held out her notes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This? I was writing about Choi Sung-yeol sunbae. He really is great, &#xA0;and none of his words are ridiculous. The money he earns as well... I want to be like him someday.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong was looking at Choi Sung-yeol with sincerely respectful eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">She was completely deceived without knowing it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The good news was that she hadn&#x2019;t been completely corrupted yet.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I need to discover how deep her feet are.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An Eun-jeong is working really hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, how did you know my name...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong asked with wide eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed to the employee ID hanging around her neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I saw the name hanging around your neck. Oh right, my name is Lee Cheol-su.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave the pseudonym he used during the voyeur incident.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I see. Anyway, I am currently a silver member. If I can recruit 10 more people, then I can upgrade to gold... I need to work harder!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong took a fighting posture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had a similar atmosphere to Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he was watching a child.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lowered his voice as much as possible and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s amazing. Already a silver member... You must have spent a large amount of money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong hesitated before opening her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Yes. In fact, it was the money I had set aside to rent a room. I used it all but... I can make a lot more once I become a gold member!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head started to hurt.</span></p><p><span style="">She must have devoted millions of won into this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After becoming a part of the multilevel marketing, a person could easily obtain a higher grade if they spent a certain amount of money.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the problem was after that happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had already invested money, and now they couldn&#x2019;t pull their feet out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once that happened, the appearance of the company would change by 180 degrees.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Gather members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Bring in more money because your shares are low.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Go out and sell new products.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There was constant exploitation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the end of the day, they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to sell enough.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong was laughing with an innocent face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I thought she was moderately quick-witted...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman in front of him never even imagined that she was being deceived.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll ask you just one thing. How many people have you brought here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well... Two or three people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A fool pulled in other fools.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The multilevel scheme was truly scary.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked with a heavy expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So they all became part of Eun-jeong&#x2019;s shares?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;... It isn&#x2019;t like that. It will be given the next time I register a name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. The people Eun-jeong brought in received consultation from another person and was registered under their name. Next time, do better. Is that the method?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong looked at Tae-hyuk with a startled expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Based on her expression, it seemed like he had struck the nail on the head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How did you know?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk told An Eun-jeong the truth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you gather 10 more people, then you can reach the gold rank?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The confident voice from a few minutes ago had become smaller.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That number will never go to zero. Eun-jeong also knows this to a certain extent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong looked at Tae-hyuk with a shocked face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had stabbed her with the sword of truth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he needed to use this degree of shock therapy on Eun-jeong.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a strange thing happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Uh, what?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk noticed a strange smell spreading in the seminar room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a smoke with a sweet, floral scent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt light-headed the moment he breathed it in.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes also became blank.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then suddenly, her eyes became animated again.</span></p><p><span style="">She spoke in a strong tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That can&#x2019;t be. I can surely upgrade my rank if I work hard! Ah, that&apos;s right. Cheol-su! Cheol-su shouldn&#x2019;t think like that. Cheol-su is also in our company. We should work hard together to make a lot of money. Then my father...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Damn...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought it was almost over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, An Eun-jeong was completely possessed by this strange perfume.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror to check his status.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;O-Oh my god! All my stats are being reduced at a tremendous pace!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">His intelligence, that was close to 50, was now near 40 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized that his judgement was gradually falling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Did they even use a hallucinogen?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He grabbed his left little finger in order to regain his spirit.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Wooduk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The twisting of the bones caused his stats to stop falling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly screamed but persisted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This isn&#x2019;t a normal method for a multilevel company. Wait a minute. Didn&#x2019;t Choi Sung-yeol have a partner?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t a criminal who worked alone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He committed his scams with an even worse colleague.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The name of another blacklist member popped into Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... Producer Kim Joon-young!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a famous criminal who produced bizarre shows, a producer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the fragrance with the hallucinatory effect...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps there were three or more criminals gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Damn. Now they are flocking.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Scammer Choi Sung-yeol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Producer Kim Joon-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An unknown perfume user.</span></p><p><span style="">Tiwai International was a lair full of criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was barely able to win against the hippo using all of his skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since then, he hadn&#x2019;t got any new skills or upgrades.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet this place had three criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there was the unidentified man who sent the note to An Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Who was he?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip as he thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;But the fact that the Producer is here...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, there wasn&#x2019;t much written about him in the blacklist. However, he remembered about the Death Circus run by the Producer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a flashy show of human desire and betrayal.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought about the structure of the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The interior was much smaller compared to the size.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like there were secret rooms that couldn&#x2019;t be entered through a normal route.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe the Producer was planning the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized that there was only one way for An Eun-jeong to escape from here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eun-jeong. If there was a way to raise your rating all at once, what would you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? A-All of a sudden?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t gold but the platinum rating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong covered her mouth with her hands at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same rating as Choi Sung-yeol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He led the thousands of silver and gold members and gained a huge amount of money from what they earned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you have any doubts, then you can ask Choi Sung-yeol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t miss the fire blazing in An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She really was an easily convinced woman.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026; If there really is such a method then I will do anything. S-Surely...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It probably isn&#x2019;t what you are thinking. You could die.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How do you know such a thing? Are you not an ordinary member?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now she had noticed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I came for this. Do you understand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I can&#x2019;t do it alone. How about it? Do you want to reach the platinum rating with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong gave a strange groan as she hesitated for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And after a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She came to a conclusion and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I accept. I should put my life on the line to make money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ugh. This woman! Does she even know what she is saying?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly screamed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The words made him feel like puking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to show An Eun-jeong reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... Yes. Let&apos;s try it. Death Circus. If I look at it directly then I&#x2019;ll discover what I need to know.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you wait a minute? I have something to say to Choi Sung-yeol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked towards the front of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two people were talking without any worries to Choi Sung-yeol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he reached Choi Sung-yeol.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is going on? I saw you talking to An Eun-jeong. Is there an incident that you would like to document?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I wanted to join. I came when I heard that Kim Joon-young was here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? You came to see Kim Joon-young...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An Eun-jeong wants to play. Both of us would like to join the Death Circus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s mouth twisted strangely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... There are applicants. How did you court An Eun-jeong? Anyway, it is nice to meet you. The show is scheduled for tonight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m glad that I don&#x2019;t have to wait.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But is it really okay? You are still young. Your lives will be ours the moment you apply to participate in the Death Circus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. I will win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol smiled brightly.</span></p><p><span style="">At best, they were hoping to pluck tens of millions of won from pushovers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet he willingly participated in the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now they could get hundreds of million of won.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That confident expression is good. Then I will introduce you to Director Kim Joon-young.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That night, the Death Circus was going to begin.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
