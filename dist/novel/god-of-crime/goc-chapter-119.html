<p><span style="">Chapter 119 - Prelude to the Mafia Game #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The Takeda family had accumulated wealth through war for a long time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After Japan&#x2019;s defeat was confirmed, they tried to somehow hide their assets, done through a variety of routes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The majority failed to be recovered.</span></p><p><span style="">The descendants of the Takeda family were still wandering the world trying to find it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They gathered together and created the Yakuza group, Kuryu-kai.</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada revealed things that he shouldn&#x2019;t have, like he was drunk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled bitterly at the sight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The effect of the magic show was more amazing than he thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Illegal Surgery was a skill that could be used to perform various surgical operations.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used it to do the impossible in reality and to make the other person think that he was in a dream.</span></p><p><span style="">Anesthesia was essential so that they didn&#x2019;t feel any pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the drug that was found in the warden&#x2019;s safe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to appropriately blend it with the Illegal Surgery skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He directly injected it into the nerves before waking up the sleeping Yakuza member.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Besides the anesthesia, isn&#x2019;t there a hypnotic effect?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk touched the remaining drug and sniffed it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a strangely sweet floral scent.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I think I&#x2019;ve smelled this somewhere before... Ah, wasn&#x2019;t this used in Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s Death Circus?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Scammer Choi Sung-yeol and Producer Kim Joon-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two criminals behind the Death Circus popped into Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol used hallucinogens to attract customers to the multi-level scheme.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The raw material was a real drug.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The prison is filled with ridiculous plots.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Drugs were grown at the request of the Triads while members of Kuryu were secretly hiding here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Blue Dragon Prison could be called the den of the mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t know anything and was just blinded by the gold...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked Nakada one last question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then who is Mister Park? He doesn&#x2019;t seem to be an executive of Kuryu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mister Park? I&apos;m sorry but this is the first time I&#x2019;ve heard that name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then it isn&#x2019;t the name of a henchman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, this person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Nakada&#x2019;s eyes started to come alive as if the drug was wearing away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and raised the cigarette that Yoo Cheol-ho smoked to Nakada&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now that&#x2019;s it. Have a good sleep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he literally collapsed on the bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After confirming that Nakada was asleep, Tae-hyuk quietly left the cell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he woke up, he really would think that everything was a dream.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, he was able to get information about the Kuryu group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They said that they were going to leave here in the aftermath of the war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the gold buried in Blue Dragon Prison were already in the hands of the Kuryu.</span></p><p><span style="">Only a few crumbs remained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These crumbs were revealed to the world in the process of construction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk finally knew why the amount of gold found wasn&#x2019;t revealed to the world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t that big.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, the buried gold was being&#xA0;moved to another country.</span></p><p><span style="">As Nakada said that, there were still gold bullions without a master in this country.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;One ball made it past the goalkeeper. I&#x2019;m not the type to give up just because my opponents are strong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, Tae-hyuk now considered the Kuryu group an enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">Then an amazing thing happened.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t use any skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Despite that, a message appeared on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This had only happened once before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was when he broke the plot of the Doll Play incident and destroyed the conspiracy related to the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a reward, he got a huge amount of points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used it to become a Noble.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gulped and read the message on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[New mission: Find out about the Mafia Game.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The following rewards can be obtained by clearing the mission.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You will become a King.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It sounds simple but... Anyway, it is one more reason to go against the mafia.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Triads committed a crime that was hard to tolerate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Yakuza were deeply rooted in Korean society ever since the Japanese occupation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were closely connected to the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In South Korea, the three criminal groups were fighting for power.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And the &#x2018;Mafia Game.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. There is no real game...They might be symbolic words like Doll Play.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could become a King by achieving this mission.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he became a Noble, he was able to do things that were incomparable to when he was a Commoner.</span></p><p><span style="">But a King...</span></p><p><span style="">What could he do then?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&apos;s eyes shone in anticipation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then first, I should speak with Choi Sung-yeol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could only stay in Blue Dragon Prison for two more days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to get all the information he needed before then.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Habits didn&#x2019;t disappear easily.</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol smirked smugly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a small company and I need talented people like you. I have six months before I am released. I&#x2019;ll give you my phone number so once you go outside, contact me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. I can really make a lot of money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It depends on you. But if you work hard, you can make a few thousand each time. Furthermore, it is a legitimate business...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In Blue Dragon Prison, there were a huge number of criminals around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol was trying to gather them for his business.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In fact, the whole thing is a scam.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed because he knew what Choi Sung-yeol wanted to do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As the prisoner talking to Choi Sung-yeol left, Tae-hyuk naturally sat down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm? Kim Cheol-su? What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A long story is annoying, so let&#x2019;s speak plainly. Don&#x2019;t you need a card shark?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It seems like the rumor that I am collecting people has entered Kim Cheol-su&#x2019;s ears. But I haven&#x2019;t planned for a card shark.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It meant that he already possessed enough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? I thought that superior card sharks were welcomed everywhere? I understand. I&#x2019;ll see about going somewhere else.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah?! Wait a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s expression changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">B grade card sharks could get a profit of millions of won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If an A grade card shark were to be mobilized, then tens of millions of won could be gained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And there were only 0.1% of card sharks who could gain hundreds of millions of won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were called superior card sharks.</span></p><p><span style="">There were in such a minority that the number present in the country could be counted on one hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the card sharks in the Death Circus were B grade.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol knew that the card sharks such as Kim Shin-hyeong and Joo Sung-il were A grade.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet someone who claimed to be superior grade card shark appeared in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol said with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If this is a lie then it won&#x2019;t just be your fingers cut off. Well, I suppose I can&#x2019;t do that in here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the most terrible thing for a card shark to fake their own rating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other words, he needed to show off his skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you want to see, then I will show you. What game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s play simple poker. I will bring two people to play as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Under Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s leadership, the poker game started in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are missing one person so I&#x2019;ll join.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go ahead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A deck of cards was placed in front of them by the human copier.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All the people who remained in the dining room after dinner gathered in front of the gambling table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was possible because there were few guards watching.</span></p><p><span style="">The four people playing each shuffled the cards so that there was no cheating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Choi Sung-yeol started distributing cards in front of everyone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One for himself, one for a pushover, and one for another pushover.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Finally, one to the card shark.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was repeated five times before he was finally ready to draw five cards.</span></p><p><span style="">Now that their hands were completed, they could exchange as many cards as they wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol kept his eyes wide open as he looked at Kim Cheol-su&#xA0;</span><span style="">Card sharks usually distributed the cards directly or shuffled at the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kim Cheol-su didn&#x2019;t do any of that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you just watching the first hand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t know until the hands were revealed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol had received a pair of Aces.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was almost the strongest hand in the first draw.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will only change one card.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will change everything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will change three cards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pushovers also changed their cards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The uncertainty of the cards being changed was the exciting thing about the five card draw.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will leave it as it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. It seems like you were quite lucky.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol gazed at the supposedly supreme card shark with narrowed eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t been able to do any tricks so far.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what was this confidence?</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the full-fledged betting began.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pushovers both forfeited with one pair and two pairs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the game became a 1:1 match between Choi Sung-yeol and Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it boring if we just play for fun?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. What about a pack of cigarettes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol completed a full house of Queens. It was quite hard to get in a five card draw.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With two bets, the pot increased to a pack of cigarettes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Show your cards. I have a Queens full house.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. It was good that you exchanged your cards. But I&#x2019;m sorry, the cigarettes are mine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly revealed his cards.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a 10, a Jack, a Queen, a King, and an Ace.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were all spades.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Royal straight flush?!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the strongest hand with a probability of 1/649,740.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fact that he hadn&#x2019;t changed any cards meant that it was already completed when he received the cards.</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s hands trembled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How was this possible?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The cigarettes are appreciated. But you kept betting. Then let&#x2019;s continue for another pack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The strongest hand wasn&#x2019;t completed due to chance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The card shark&#x2019;s confidence might be due to a trick.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to believe what he saw in front of his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When the hell did he do the trick?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This time I will shuffle alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The second game started.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time, Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t even check his cards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No change is necessary. I will leave it as it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol forfeited with a pair of 9s and the two pushovers also forfeited.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk won the round without needing to show his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need to show it, but this is a test of my gambling skills. Let&#x2019;s open it because I am curious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol carefully revealed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s cards.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;O-Oh my god...</span></p><p><span style="">It was another royal straight flush.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I hope this is enough to believe that I am a superior card shark.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Of course. But how on earth...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but it is a trade secret.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol sighed with a red face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to believe even after seeing it with his own eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a superior card shark that was within the top 0.1%.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu... At any rate, it is a great technique.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t figure out what trick the opponent used, no matter how he squeezed his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol looked at the card shark with respect in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I just need some work. If you are already full then it can&#x2019;t be helped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. A person like you is always welcome. However, if you are that good then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Working with Choi Sung-yeol wouldn&#x2019;t be able to get him hundreds of millions of won.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly reached out his hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Choi Sung-yeol approached and politely bowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard rumors that you use a type of drug. It is hard to find in South Korea. If you give me that, I&#x2019;ll show off my skills. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol nodded with an expression of understanding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he spoke in a small voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. I knew a very good route to get that drug. I will introduce you to them if you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">He had caught the fish.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
