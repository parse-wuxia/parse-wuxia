Aish, when did this fall? &#xA0;Last time I lost it, I had to spend 200,000 won&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">to buy</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a new one from the stolen goods department</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">!</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;I&#x2019;m glad you found it this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It passed!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Furthermore, it was a stolen property.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;is a relief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Kang-suk wasn&#x2019;t the neighbourhood hyung type, but the neighbourhood fool type.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Anyway, a deposit on a house would be difficult with 30 million won. The housing prices have gone insanely expensive these days. Are you living together with just your noona?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Nope. My younger brother as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Three people. Well, you should have at least two rooms. Will the house be near here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes. Noona works at a factory&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">nearby, so</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t needs to be within a walking distance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk was thinking with all his strength</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;as if</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it was his own problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk already knew that Kang-suk was overflowing with kindness and&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">openness</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, he hadn&#x2019;t expected this&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">level of sincerity</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;It is good that I&#x2019;m entrusting it to Kang-suk.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">let out</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a strange moan as he searched through a real estate app.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You&#x2019;ll need at least 30 million won to rent a house. Damn. There are no taxes set on the bounties from companies... Shouldn&#x2019;t the country pay more when such a big criminal is caught?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Wait. A bounty from companies?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m certain that a big company put out a bounty for Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He couldn&#x2019;t remember exactly where.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Where was it... ah. Sungjin Group!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk carefully told this fact to Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk was delighted, as if it was his own work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes. Let&#x2019;s jump and catch two things today!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;We&#x2019;ll go get the bounty from the government first. Do we receive it from Central Bank?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;It is like the lottery. Did you bring what I asked you to?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They were</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;copies of his ID card and a bankbook in his own name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;If you send that to the person in charge ,then it will be deposited by tomorrow. Originally,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">they reward</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;would be received from Central Bank, but it is like Tae-hyuk said. There would be problems if you&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">went</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Certainly. Lotto prizes&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">would be</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;received, there so there&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">would be</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;dung flies buzzing aro</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">und</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;all day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Haha. Yes, dung flies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">people looking for investors,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;saying they had a &#x2018;sure fire&#x2019; item. Businessmen asking for donations. In addition, there were gangsters with crude and rough words. Various groups would be gathered like flies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk gathered the papers that Tae-hyuk gave him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ll give this to the person in charge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Kang-suk hyung</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;I really appreciate</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;what you&#x2019;ve done so far</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No, it</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2019;s fine</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. Anyway, I will be interviewed as the detective who caught Yoo Cheol-ho</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">and it&#x2019;ll</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;come out on the evening news.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Oh. You will be a celebrity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, he wondered what type of clothing would be worn for the interview. Surely, he wouldn&#x2019;t show up on TV like that?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk had an ominous feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;One thing is over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It ended earlier than he thought.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk said with a satisfied expression</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s storm the Sungjin Group.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well. Can we do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Of course. I made a key tip in catching Yoo Cheol-ho. Kang-suk hyung is the one who caught Yoo Cheol-ho. If we can&#x2019;t go, then who can?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I-is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then we will go straight to headquarters. I know the location.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You sound like you worked there or something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk just smiled instead of answering.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Worked there?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the place where he was p</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">reviously</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;framed.</span></p><hr><p></p></div><p></p>
