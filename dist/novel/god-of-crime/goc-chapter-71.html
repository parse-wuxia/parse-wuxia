<p><span style="">Chapter 71 - DATE HARD 2.0 #4 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;The money offered is 200,000 won?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aish, it can&#x2019;t be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;220,000?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was more than he thought, so Kang Han-seong stuttered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk joined his thumb and index finger together to make another circle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough... It isn&#x2019;t a bad opportunity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I&#x2019;m doing this after thinking of your position. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s suggestion was like the devil&#x2019;s temptation to Kang Han-seong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Money was money, but if those photos were known to the neighborhood, then he would have to immediately step down from his position in Nuclear Bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kang Han-seong made a decision and nodded,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are Tae-hyuk? This is a contractual relationship, and I absolutely won&#x2019;t be your subordinate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I did not need such subordinates.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He turned the iron pipe round and round and released the net and glue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The trick was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He stole the net and glue from the other person using Robbery and gathered it neatly in one hand.</span></p><p><span style="">The released people ran towards the clothes that were piled up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, that is my clothing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is mine!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Check your eyes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters fought each other to get dressed before standing in a line in front of Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyone who has a complaint can tell me. I&#x2019;ll make sure that you don&#x2019;t get bored. Of course, then you won&#x2019;t be able to receive compensation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters were quiet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had already been discussed by the representatives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These henchmen were in a situation where they couldn&#x2019;t talk, even if they were disgruntled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Besides, they couldn&#x2019;t defeat Tae-hyuk in a 1 on 1 fight anyways.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, this problem ended well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was two million won per case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if it was shared between 10 people, it was still a large amount.</span></p><p><span style="">Where else could they make that type of money?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk used a carrot and stick approach to tame the wild gangsters.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh right, I have something for you to do right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, relax. Do you see that Hyung out there? </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... Uh. Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t hard. I just want you to act as usual. The details...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk told them his plan for Kang-suk while Kang Han-seong nodded with understanding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! Then you want to increase his manliness through this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Exactly.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can really get two million won if we do this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll give it in cash. Of course, I can&#x2019;t give you the photos I just took. Once I am assured of a good relationship, I will hand it over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Considering Han-seong&#x2019;s position, it wasn&#x2019;t a bad offer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He soon forgot why he came here as he discussed the plan to become a villain.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the ambitious gangsters were ready to go and pick a fight with Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the restaurant was already empty.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered with a blank expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kang-suk hyung. Your progress is too fast! Already...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, after looking like a dog chasing after a chicken, Tae-hyuk mentally educated the gangsters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang Han-seong remembered that Tae-hyuk went to A High School and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t need to babysit your fellow students right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded, as he wasn&#x2019;t their leader.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no obligation to guard all the students.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were exceptions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute. Do you want me to show you something interesting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From now on, this tree will be half gone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked to a big tree outside the restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he literally swung his iron pipe with all his strength.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was a loud sound and half of the wood disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you touch any person under my protection then you will be very sick.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hik!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters&#x2019; paled at the power of the iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How the hell did he have so much strength?</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong realized that he had touched a sleeping lion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was fortunate that Tae-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t used violence on them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m looking forward to your work in the future, Han-seong hyung.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and stretched out his hand, and Kang Han-seong started sweating as he shook it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This considerably improved the relationship between the two people.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You look really beautiful dressed up. But from now on, a change of clothes is needed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s eyes widened with surprise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk sweat the moment he realized what he said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, ugh... H-Ha-ran! I-I absolutely am not taking you to a strange place!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I am Cho Kang-suk. Do you believe me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was speechless.</span></p><p><span style="">The typical words of a bad man had emerged from his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk blushed as he showed her what was in the bag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a Santa suit and a Christmas elf costume.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s face reddened the moment she saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk took the Santa suit and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-After changing, there is a place I want you to come with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...K-Kang-suk. A Santa costume is too crazy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Aaaagh! It isn&#x2019;t like that! Ha-ran will wear the Christmas elf over there. I will wear the Santa costume.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk proposed wearing the Santa suit for his volunteer work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was misunderstood as strange behaviour.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran poked her fingers together in embarrassment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people laughed as they looked at each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Ha-ran. What were you imagining?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kang-suk should&#x2019;ve given me a precise explanation!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk finally realized that his explanation was quite poor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll explain. There is an orphanage that I sponsor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Orphanage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. They have no parents to become Santa, so every year I become Santa. I wanted to go with Ha-ran this year so I prepared the costumes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran started to move her fingers in circles.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I-I didn&#x2019;t know so I had some strange thoughts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&#x2019;t mind, would you like to hand out gifts with me? Maybe you will like it as well. Oh, today was supposed to be a day for Ha-ran. Sorry for asking this all of a sudden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s heart started to beat faster at the gruff, but warm Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I want to go with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Then let&#x2019;s change the clothes we are wearing. If we clearly explain to the owner then he will let us use the locker room. Oh, do you want to be Santa or the elf? It is a little big because the Santa costume is for men.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll take the elf.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The costume that Kang-suk provided wasn&#x2019;t like Tinkerbell, who was often the image when thinking of a fairy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a Christmas elf with pumpkin pants and a green cap.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ve changed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Me too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran couldn&#x2019;t resist laughing after seeing Kang-suk wearing Santa clothes and the beard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;F-Fuhub...! I&#x2019;m sorry. It really suits you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked like he was a mixed martial artist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will really look like it if I carry the gifts. Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! Santa should have presents!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s go. The limo will be waiting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Santa is coming in a limo instead of a sleigh. It is strangely modern.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Indeed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The two people looked at each other and laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">The prepared gifts weren&#x2019;t that expensive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Teddy bears, crayons, sketchbooks, lego toys, etc.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The name of each child was written on the wrapping paper.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran asked after seeing it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you prepare everything they wanted?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Last month, I asked them to write down any gift that they wanted to receive from Grandpa Santa. I prepared their gifts to the best of my ability.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is really great. You do this every year?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I started five years ago. But a few years ago, they started telling me to bring Rudolph or an elf. That reminded me to ask Ha-ran to join me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran realized that the children knew Santa&#x2019;s identity, and she could understand the meaning of the children telling Kang-suk not to come alone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her chest warmed at their consideration towards each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So shall we do this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was carrying heavy gifts but her footsteps seemed strangely light.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hohoho! Kids, Santa is here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! Kang-suk o... No, Santa oppa!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Today I even brought an elf noona!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! Oppa is good!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The children of the orphanage cheered at Santa Kang-suk&#x2019;s appearance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The popularity of Santa Kang-suk was enormous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The amount of gifts was too much for Kang-suk to carry alone, so Ha-ran arrived a bit later with some gifts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! Elf noona is also working!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran raised her hand and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, please stand in a line to make it easier for Grandpa Santa to hand out the gifts!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A girl, who seemed to be an elementary student, shook her head and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not grandpa! Oppa!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, Santa oppa!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was happy not to be called a grandpa.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran felt strangely sorry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The kindergarten kids seemed to know the identity of Santa Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hohoho! Merry Christmas!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Still, Ha-ran burst out laughing after seeing him desperately pretending to be Santa.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! Elf&#xA0;unni! Your smile is so beautiful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. Since Santa oppa is busy, I will give out the gifts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes~&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The kids gathered in front of Ha-ran like baby birds waiting for food.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran laughed at the cute faces.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Ha-ran looked at Kang-suk who had children hanging on him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He did this type of thing every year, but he also worked day and night shifts to catch criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this was more like a family than a sponsorship.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Santa doesn&#x2019;t have enough sense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran suddenly heard a familiar voice from behind her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was Seo Tae-hyuk, dressed as Rudolph.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? T-Tae-hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This can&#x2019;t be missed when it is Christmas.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started stacking some boxes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The children shrieked with joy when they saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! Cake!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Chicken!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Rudolph is amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Santa Kang-suk asked Rudolph Tae-hyuk,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. You suddenly disappeared on the date. If you do this then you should tell me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I forgot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, I will share this. It is one box per two people. There is plenty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As expected from our Rudolph!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Santa Kang-suk, Rudolph Tae-hyuk and Elf Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The three representatives of Christmas earnestly started the Christmas party with the children of the orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everyone gathered shouted with one heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Merry Christmas!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a fun party for a sacred night.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">At dawn, it was a restaurant staff member who came to work and discovered it.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was Christmas morning, but he could get more money on days like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyway, it wasn&#x2019;t like he had family to spend the holidays with.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to make as much money as possible to pay the rent for next month.</span></p><p><span style="">Snow had fallen overnight so the streets were covered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, this is the devil&apos;s dung powder. I&#x2019;ll get rid of all this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to do business, the snow piled in front of the store had to be removed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The staff member grumbled as he shovelled the snow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. It is cold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The weather was cold enough to petrify the brain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time he opened his mouth, a white cloud would emerge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, he found something strange in front of the restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Christmas tree? There was something like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The staff member spat on the white snow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Christmas tree was decorated with something colorful, and the snow piled white on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did Boss put this up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If so, he needed to clean up the tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The staff member started getting rid of the devil&#x2019;s dung powder piled up on the tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then something red emerged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first, he thought it was just a unique looking decoration.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he realized it wasn&#x2019;t ordinary as he looked closer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? It is a little odd looking... Aaaaacck!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The staff member shrieked as he realized what was on the tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like the remains of a broken doll.</span></p><p><span style="">Small arms and slender legs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">10 or more of them hung from the tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The thing he thought was a red ornament was actually blood flowing from the arms and legs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-Body...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">On Christmas morning, a tree decorated with body parts&#xA0;was found in front of a restaurant.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
