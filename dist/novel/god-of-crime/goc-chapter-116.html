<p><span style="">Chapter 116 - The Price of their Sins #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho leaned back in a chair that was so comfortable that it felt like his bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been one month since he entered jail.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk replied from the built in cabinet of the investigation headquarters.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Has it already been that long? Time really goes by quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We were able to find many of the victims that Park Sung-yul killed. Still, isn&#x2019;t there something lacking? I feel like he is acting less compared to Phantom of the past.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, that is certainly true but... Isn&#x2019;t it for the best if we can solve the case without any problems?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, it would be interesting if there was something bigger...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He sounded like a child with a toy that had been taken away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho had expected to solve the puzzles first, so it was natural that he was disappointed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey! It is our fault if something blows up!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I suppose I just don&#x2019;t care?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo! As expected of a building owner!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk talked lightly like it was a joke, but he was actually serious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If anything went wrong, then he was prepared to take all responsibility and resign.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk felt a strange responsibility towards Park Sung-yul who he arrested.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he had acted better during the interrogation then he could&#x2019;ve discovered that Park Sung-yul was a serial killer.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk bit his lip and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom, make sure that Park Sung-yul pays for all the sins he committed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho raised a thumb at Kang-suk&#x2019;s serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh. Sunbae, you look like a detective in a drama.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not a detective in a drama but one in reality.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk decided to give his junior a headlock.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Wait a minute! Stop it! Sunbae, look at the breaking news right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who would believe such lies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is real! H-Here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho, who had been watching the Internet news, raised his phone before Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk released his arm and focused on the phone screen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Bio-business that emerged as the next generation growth engine... I don&#x2019;t think this is it. Controversy over Sungjin Group again... Not it either...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not there, the society side!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho enlarged the screen when Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t find it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, here. Ack what is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Prisoners are bombers? What is happening on Prison Island?]</span></p><p><span style="">The article was half speculative and didn&#x2019;t talk about the incident occurring.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kang-suk sensed that something was happening just from that sentence.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What the hell are you doingggg! Phaaaantooooom!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk screamed with an agonizing expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;G-Great! This is Phantom! Uhaha! Sunbae! Isn&#x2019;t it very interesting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The grinning Hyun-ho raised a thumb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reactions of the two people were completely the opposite.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk experienced his biggest victory at the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many cheaters there that made him feel challenged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he thought about that time, the people that he was dealing with now felt like children.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he imitated the warden&#x2019;s voice and asked for support.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The inmates have made a bomb... it isn&#x2019;t a toy. It has enough power to blow away at least one floor of the building. The damage to the guards isn&#x2019;t great yet, but just in case...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made it seem like an atomic bomb had been made of crude materials obtained in the prison.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">U-Understood.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll make sure someone gets out to you as quickly as possible.</span></i></p><p><span style="">He could tell that the voice of the other person on the phone was shaking.</span></p><p><span style="">The bait was eaten!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">After sending the request for support, Tae-hyuk leaked information to several news organizations about the incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho would do a good job, but Phantom couldn&#x2019;t appear in this case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This had to be an incident occurring due to Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">After all the calls were finished, Tae-hyuk quietly put down the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of the actors are now gathered. Brown Bear should launch the fireworks for the new audience.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Shin Chang-ho was setting up the bomb in a passage that led outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. This is a real bomb so I&#x2019;m pretty nervous...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This would buy time to slow down the enemy&#x2019;s entry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was just one bomb but the opponents didn&#x2019;t know that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once they saw the havoc of one bomb, who could easily enter?</span></p><p><span style="">They were Chinese inmates who were ordered to fight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once they realized that their lives were in danger, they wouldn&#x2019;t move as the warden commanded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The road to victory has finally opened.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho laid the bomb on the flat ground with trembling hands and took out two bags, making sure to mix the contents well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A stain spread like a green liquid was sprinkled inside and it quickly turned purple.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It is complete. Now the wristwatch that will act as the primer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He turned a knob twice and the stopped clock needle starting moving again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The next 30 seconds!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho bolted back to the command room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His head had turned white and he couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a dangerous job with the risk of serious injuries if something went wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he had to know when exactly the bomb was going to explode.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho slowly counted in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">One, two...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...29... 30...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho fell to the ground while running.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a bit hasty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It took a few more seconds to reach 30 and then the bomb went off.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kukukukung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though he had ran to almost the end of the corridor, he could &#xA0;still feel the vibration of the explosion in the air.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho spat out the dust that filled his mouth and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a weak bomb? Just a bit more and the whole prison would be gone!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a bright smile on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The image of his little sister, Shin Seo-yeon appeared in his mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite not seeing her for several years, he was able to vividly recall her features.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes. I did everything that Cigarette Seller asked, and now I can hear where Seo-yeon is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That was clearly the terms of the agreement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he didn&#x2019;t believe everything that Cigarette Seller said. But he showed an unbelievable ability.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So he really might know where Seo-yeon was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Once I find out, will I be able to call her after a long time? Then I will apologize for living as a fool. Will Seo-yeon laugh and forgive me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he would once again ask her to wait.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho laughed as he thought of his sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the man called Brown Bear and an object of terror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was only a cute baby bear in front of the girl he liked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I have to return to the command room first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He got up and brushed off the dust on his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He erased the appearance of Shin Seo-yeon in his head and returned to his usual appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">Once he returned, his men greeted him with excited faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim! Brown Bear did great!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is this really Hyung-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Boss! We will take care of those bastards!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho asked his excited subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened to the enemies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They were going to enter but fled once the bomb exploded.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. I wonder what the warden looks like now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho sighed with relief.</span></p><p><span style="">The operation was a success.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The enemies were less likely to enter due to potential bombs being installed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, they just needed to wait here for the rest of the time.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho turned and looked for the Cigarette Seller.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was sitting in a chair and looking at the prisoners with cold eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cigarette Seller. I&#x2019;ve done everything you said. As promised, tell me where my sister is right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t I already give it to you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Something was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cigarette Seller had only given him the bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t seem like the type to lie in such an obvious manner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then did he receive something without knowing it?</span></p><p><span style="">Seo-yeon&#x2019;s voice was suddenly heard in Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I waited 10 years.</span></i> <i><span style="">Seven years isn&#x2019;t long.</span></i></p><p><span style="">As if to erase it, Cigarette Seller said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can&#x2019;t forget this important thing. Here it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk opened the drawer of the table where he was sitting and threw a bunch of papers at Shin Chang-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho received it with a bemused expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the crime notes that Park Joon-shik had obtained after torturing Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Shin Chang-ho remembered his words.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-If you succeed, you will also get what you want.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;This, this thing, it is what I want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He recalled everything he knew about Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A bastard who brutally murdered a weak woman who couldn&#x2019;t fight back and was caught trying to get rid of the body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would tremble whenever he encountered someone in the restaurant or yard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A typical type of person who was weak against the strong, and strong against the weak.</span></p><p><span style="">Now his crime records were in front of Shin Chang-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He turned the pages as if he was spellbound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He passed through many people before finding his lover that his subordinates couldn&#x2019;t find.</span></p><p><span style="">[13th Puzzle - Shin Seo-yeon]</span></p><p><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll tell you.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll speak!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">She was someone I accidentally met.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">I was upset and riding on a city bus.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">I got to the end point.</span></i> <i><span style="">It was a beach town...</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">There was a woman with a sweet atmosphere sitting by the waterfront.</span></i> <i><span style="">I noticed she was crying and went and sat down next to her.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">However, she wasn&#x2019;t sad.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">No, she looked delighted.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">It was like she received a proposal from someone she liked.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Why, yes that&#x2019;s it.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">So she was crying happy tears.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">Her crying resonated with me.</span></i> <i><span style="">She looked so beautiful...</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">I threw the knife I was holding without knowing it.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">I got her name from her ID card.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">She was older than she looked.</span></i> <i><span style="">I thought she was only 20...</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Oh, please remove the scissors.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll talk!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">I understand.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll tell you simply.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">The body is...</span></i></p><p><span style="">The report continued but Shin Chang-ho was unable to read it anymore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was so furious that everything turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hyung-nim, what is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Where is Park Sung-yul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you looking for Park Sung-yul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will kill him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho no longer cared about winning this war.</span></p><p><span style="">Kill Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">He seemed to be alive just for this.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
