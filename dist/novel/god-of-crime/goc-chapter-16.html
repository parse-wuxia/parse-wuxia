<p><span style="">Chapter 16: Having Too Much of a Good Thing #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha! Seo Tae-hyuk! You raised the white flag to surrender!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang was delighted after hearing that Tae-hyuk wouldn&#x2019;t go against his cheating.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, he hadn&#x2019;t imagined that he would lose so much money as well as a follower.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, in the end, he was able to get what he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was so delighted that it was almost unbearable.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang clicked his tongue and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;By the way, I am sorry. I can&#x2019;t cancel the expulsion. The water has already been spilled.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, that? I&#x2019;m okay. I can just transfer. But I would need a lot of money to move schools. I&#x2019;ll also need to buy a new uniform.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, giving you money... Haha. It seems like we are talking now. By the way, do you still want 500 million?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I&apos;m sorry, that was a joke. I am happy with 500,000.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha! I&#x2019;ll forgive you. I am generous! If this doesn&#x2019;t leak, I will give you 2.5 million? How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang called out to An Eun-young who was behind Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, Class President. You made a very smart choice. It would have been your turn next time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, what a pity. I couldn&#x2019;t take any photos. Well, lately... The composition technology is really great. Won&#x2019;t it look completely real?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang held his belly and laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s face turned white. She could imagine what the photos would show.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang stepped closer to An Eun-young, then he whispered in her ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t there still a long time until graduation? Please take care in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He moved away from An Eun-young and grabbed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s collar.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk just extended his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Give me the money as soon as possible. At any rate. Is this the establishment of a contract?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang held Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hand and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ll deposit it straight away. I am thorough regarding deals.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s hand with his right hand while his left hand manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I really didn&#x2019;t want to use the points on this but&#x2026; damn, I&#x2019;ll bite you to your very bones.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used the three affinity points he had saved up.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Robbery has gained a new attribute.]</span></p><p><span style="">[When a robbery occurs, you will have three seconds to choose the item you want.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The items owned by the other person can be checked by &#x2018;Spying.&#x2019;]</span></p><p><span style="">After confirming that the attribute was bought successfully, Tae-hyuk used Spying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He confirmed that Park Sung-kwang had the item he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sent a signal to An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As promised, she pretended to fall and pushed him to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Class President must have been nervous. Can you lend a helping hand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head like he was uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it was a mistake.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Please select the item you want to steal!</span></p><p><span style="">A variety of items came up.</span></p><p><span style="">He quickly selected the desired item and activated the skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This time, it will be a success! Fighting!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">-You have succeeded in stealing the opponent&#x2019;s belongings!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk cheered inwardly.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will explain how Class President should show me your answer sheet.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">A corner of his mouth went up, and he started to laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;How long can you laugh?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Everything that Tae-hyuk needed was gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now was the time for a counterattack.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s cheating method was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s job was to place her answer sheet on her desk before the test ended.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would take care of the rest of the cheating himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is like Mission Impossible.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang seemed to know what he was doing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had installed a miniature surveillance camera on the ceiling above An Eun-young&#x2019;s desk. </span><span style="">Then someone would look and report it to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The camera must be expensive.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It needed to be able to see the letters on the answer sheet clearly from a distance, so it was impossible without an ultra-high resolution.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang always wore glasses that didn&#x2019;t have any prescription lenses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had thought it was just for his intelligence image.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it served as the receiver of a radio.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is quite rational.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The most critical thing about cheating was if the answer sheet showed the wrong information.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it didn&#x2019;t matter if the person was trustworthy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, half of the people had been coerced through intimidation. There was a possibility they would give wrong information in the desire to die together.</span></p><p><span style="">So, he had to block it.</span></p><p><span style="">It was time for An Eun-young to show Park Sung-kwang the test paper as instructed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she was still concentrating on the paper.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang, who was sitting behind Tae-hyuk, started to feel nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Class President is doing well.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang couldn&#x2019;t imagine that An Eun-young taking her time was part of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to make him feel urgent so he would make rushed decisions.</span></p><p><span style="">It was seven minutes before the end of the test.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Three minutes after Park Sung-kwang instructed, An Eun-young placed her answer sheet by a corner of the desk.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a sigh of relief from behind Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Park Sung-kwang. It seems like you are sitting behind me so that I can&#x2019;t do anything stupid. I bet you never thought it would be an outer shell.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had decided the location in advance, and Park Sung-kwang and his friends were currently not sitting in their usual seats.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s seat, which was originally a little further away, was now right in front of Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the test was over.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang succeeded in copying An Eun-young&#x2019;s answer sheet perfectly as planned.</span></p><p><span style="">The supervising teacher announced the end of the test.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;People sitting in the back, please pick up all the answer sheets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at his answer sheet.</span></p><p><span style="">It was marked with the attendance number of Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Now, it is showtime!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately bumped into the person walking with the answer sheets...</span></p><p><span style="">And the Robbery skill was triggered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s answer sheet had already been collected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was what Tae-hyuk had been aiming for.</span></p><p><span style="">His new attribute that he had spent three affinity points on surfaced.</span></p><p><span style="">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Please select the item you want to steal!</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the list were answer sheets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk picked Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Damn. Failed!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bought himself some time without feeling embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, why aren&#x2019;t you apologizing for bumping into me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-that, Tae-hyuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, did I do something wrong?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he bumped into the other person a few times on purpose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He really seemed like a gangster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Well, his image was already lost. </span><span style="">So, he decided to use everything available.</span></p><p><span style="">The students who were watching clicked their tongues.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he managed to steal what he wanted after three attempts.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s answer sheet was in his pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He succeeded in secretly stealing Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s answer sheet and no one in the class noticed.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Will the success rate go up if I increase dexterity?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like he had to raise both intelligence and dexterity.</span></p><p><span style="">Then with a casual expression, he handed out the answer sheet marked with Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s attendance number.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s answer sheet in his pocket was quickly changed to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s own number with corrective tape.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he handed it to An Eun-young, who was collecting the test papers in the next column.</span></p><p><span style="">One sheet missing from one place. An extra one in another. However, no one was aware because the teacher was collecting everything into one pile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This process was repeated for all the subjects.</span></p><p><span style="">So, An Eun-young&#x2019;s answer sheet was copied by Park Sung-kwang. It then became Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s answer sheet.</span></p><p><span style="">As for Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Sung-kwang, I was learning the basics and didn&#x2019;t even study for this exam. There will be a lot of water falling on my answer sheet.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The test results came out one week later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was also the same day that Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s disciplinary committee would be held.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What will happen if the second ranked person in the school suddenly broke down? I am looking forward to it. Also, there is still one more step.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t going to finish it with just this much.</span></p><p><span style="">The game was just starting.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
