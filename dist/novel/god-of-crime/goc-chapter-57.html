<p><span style="">Chapter 57: Black Sheep Exodus #4 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk checked the badges of the participants with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them had the number 200 or more on the display.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A total of 3.67 billion won...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to collect the target amount 40 minutes earlier than expected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, he was supposed to search for the fifth wolf and reunite with the gambling brothers.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were hiding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe Kim Joon-young had issued some instructions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a result, he could save more than 30 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">There was now a cheerful atmosphere around the group as Yoon Jong-hyun walked out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Boss. What will you do with the wolf?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an expression that indicated he would do anything that was ordered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof! Oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina&#x2019;s face turned white.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her life now depended on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words, and she couldn&#x2019;t even defend herself because she was gagged.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I said that I would take everyone out of here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, even a traitor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk immediately answered like it was a no-brainer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes. I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to talk to her for a bit before that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The other gathered people disappeared and Tae-hyuk approached Mina with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you surprised that you&#x2019;re still alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to hear some information from Mina noona. Do you know anything about the fifth wolf?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina&#x2019;s face changed from white to purple.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m asking you to tell me right away. I&#x2019;m a little bit interested in who he is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had smelled a familiar scent while walking around Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He checked the Demon Revealing Mirror and all of his stats were decreasing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, his concentration didn&#x2019;t decline as fast as before.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyways, there was definitely a criminal who used psychedelic fragrances in the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were clearly a wolf, and not a regular participant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then another wolf, Mina, was more likely to know his identity.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled a syringe containing clear liquid from his pocket and stabbed it in Mina&#x2019;s arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not a professional at this, so please understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof..!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina fiercely struggled but her body was tied up and resistance was impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you curious about what this is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk tossed the syringe and said.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mina looked at him with shaking eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a black and red butterfly stain at the place where he injected her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, don&#x2019;t worry. The stain will disappear in a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started to explain with an emotionless face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, if you don&#x2019;t receive the antidote within a week, then blood will pour out from every hole in your body and you will die... Ah, it is unfortunate that I won&#x2019;t be able to see it directly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head with a grim expression. He truly felt sorry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U...! Ooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Poison?</span></p><p><span style="">Did you inject poison just now?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">An ominous energy was coming from the black butterfly on Mina&#x2019;s arm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, blood pouring from every hole in her body...</span><span style="">This was the first time she heard of this poison.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, think of it as an offering.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned around and walked to the place where everyone else was gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">Mina realized that the moment she left this place, she had to mobilize all of her power to find that man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she didn&#x2019;t, then she would die.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wow. Isn&#x2019;t this really usable?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It stated the remaining number of times he could use the Counterfeit skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Counterfeit skill 1/3]</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;In the end, it is three times a day?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Counterfeit had the ability to make tangible things look different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was particularly useful because it didn&#x2019;t need materials to be used.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Instead, he could only use it three times a day.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled Mina&#x2019;s expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She looked at him like she was seeing a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Aigoo. Today is the day when I am hated by females.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk received information about the fifth wolf.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to do that, it was necessary to trick Jeon Mina.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, that was just water so don&#x2019;t blame me.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="">The Bluff Poker table had a bunch of syringes to draw blood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had taken one, filled it up with water, and injected it in Mina. Then he triggered the Counterfeit skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It made her feel like the drug had turned her skin black.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moreover, the duration of the Counterfeit skill was five minutes, so it would return to its original state.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took full advantage of this to deceive Mina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thinking about it again, his acting was really plausible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now she would try everything she could to meet him in a week.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it is time for the Producer to call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All of the participants had the 200 million won needed to clear the circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was something that Kim Joon-young would need to react to.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The participants, who didn&#x2019;t know what Tae-hyuk was plotting, were talking among themselves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then we&#x2019;ll become platinum members of the company now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course! We cleared the Death Circus!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ohhhh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">They were purely delighted.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">The guests were still here, so there couldn&#x2019;t be any nonsense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyway, they had achieved the goal in accordance to the rules of the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But would 17 people really get the platinum membership card?</span></p><p><span style="">That Choi Sung-yeol?</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, an announcement was heard inside the Death Circus.</span></p><p><i><span style="">- Bravo!</span></i> <i><span style="">Congratulations on clearing the Death Circus!</span></i> <i><span style="">All of you will receive Tiwai International&#x2019;s platinum membership certificate.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then please follow the guide outside.</span></i> <i><span style="">There will also be an award ceremony for Lee Cheol-su as the representative of the participants</span></i><span style="">.</span></p><p><span style="">After the announcement ended, all of the participants threw their badges into the sky and cheered.</span></p><p><span style="">Only An Eun-jeong and Yoon Jong-hyun were watching Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">A platinum member of Tiwai.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant becoming part of those who tried to kill them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there were currently 15 platinum members in Tiwai.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they upgraded all 17 people, then it would double in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If a person thought calmly, they would absolutely never receive the compensation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, they might not even survive this place.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk just spoke with a relaxed smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They called. Don&#x2019;t you have to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In no time, dozens of men in black suits were surrounding the participants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their waists were bulging, as if they were wearing something underneath.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A black suited man gestured to Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other participants stepped closer to Tae-hyuk with uneasy eyes. If they followed him then they could at least live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the men in black suits stopped the participants from walking forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The other people, please wait here. We will bring Lee Cheol-su first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked back at the participants and followed the black suited man in silence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Producer Kim Joon-young would obviously be waiting for him.</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining An Eun-jeong muttered something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The exodus hasn&#x2019;t ended yet? What...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh my god, I never thought you would really clear the Death Circus. You showed me many great things today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young headed towards Tae-hyuk with a welcoming pose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place that Tae-hyuk was guided to was the Producer&#x2019;s office, furnished with a big monitor and luxurious furniture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would watch the Death Circus using this monitor.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young touched a chair and indicated for him to sit down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s get into the specifics.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat down in the chair and Kim Joon-young opened his arms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Congratulations. With this, you have become a member of Tiwai International.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with an impatient look,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not one of the players. Aren&#x2019;t you tired? Won&#x2019;t you cut to the chase?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young looked at Cheol-su with an expression of interest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Indeed, I know it all. Personally, I think that you are a mysterious expert brought by one of the guests.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is something similar.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Indeed! Then I will be blunt. I would like to scout you. I will try to match your conditions as much as possible. If you become the head of the wolves, then I&#x2019;m sure the Death Circus will become the best show in history.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought that Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s actions in the Death Circus were to show off his skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So how much money can you give me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Please wait a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young took out a tablet PC and showed a neatly organized table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a contract stating the terms and conditions.</span></p><p><span style="">Scamming and ruining one person was worth 20 million won, while a frontal match was 30 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And if he created a show like this one, then he would get 200 million in incentives.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pushed away the contract and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will only appear twice. Additionally, if I kill more than 10 people then the payout is doubled.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s fingers trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough. Double?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young briefly thought about it, but he realized the value of the man in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Then let&#x2019;s sign a formal contract.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised his hand as Kim Joon-young was about to hand him the contract.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait. Before that, I want to say hello to the audience as the main character of the Death Circus. If I&#x2019;m lucky, then can&#x2019;t I get tips?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted to ask you that. Everyone wants to meet you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This... Today I made a lot of money. That reminds me, what about the other participants? Surely you won&#x2019;t give all of them a platinum membership card.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s eyes shone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He asked, so naturally the answer was obvious.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, 20 drums will be dumped off the coast tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, indeed! You truly are a bad person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for the compliment. Then let&#x2019;s go greet the guests.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young completely believed in Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">His gait, his gestures, his expression, and especially, his tone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything about Tae-hyuk showed that he was the best criminal around.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was all just acting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk followed behind Kim Joon-young and confirmed the message from Moonlight Flower.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Everything is ready.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled widely.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There was an uproar as Tae-hyuk entered the ballroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he had become a Hollywood star.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh! You are the main character of the Death Circus right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Great skills!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! Truly a wolf candidate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah. I am already looking forward to your next stage!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk entered and greeted them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Applause rang out here and there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello. I am Lee Cheol-su.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">People gathered around him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were holding something in their hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Today&apos;s performance was so good. This is a tip.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a 10 million won check.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a platinum card. You can use up to 100 million freely. Have this glass of wine as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In an instant, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands became heavy with gifts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. By the way, I have something I personally want to say to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He caught the attention of the masked people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Were the tips too burdensome?</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk gestured, the woman in the butterfly mask came out from among the masked people with a bunch of documents.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. Thank you. I will definitely pay this back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah. You didn&#x2019;t keep your promise from before. Still, it was fun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the two people conversed, the lion mask and opera mask came forward.</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...As expected, you know this person!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The opera mask said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the bundle of documents and skimmed through it.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah. The one wearing the lion mask. Aren&#x2019;t you Song Won-jin, the chairman of the Taesung Group? You have a hobby like this. Ah, then the opera mask, you are the daughter of the president of Taesung Group? I thought you were married. An affair like this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started to slowly reveal the identity of the masked people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The inside of the room became frenzied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What is this? Fuck, block his mouth right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is this bastard doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and raised a hand as if to block the masked people rushing towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop moving! If you don&#x2019;t want to die then stay still.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy bastard. Are you pranking us right now? President Kim. Send that bastard out right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young was furious.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been feeling good about finding a worthy wolf after a long time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Death Circus would flourish with him as a wolf, but now everything was messed up.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Cheol-su was revealing the identity of the guests.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now they wouldn&#x2019;t come to see his show again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young thought about how he could painfully kill Cheol-su and called out to the suited men waiting outside.</span></p><p><span style="">The men armed with guns approached.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Stay still if we don&#x2019;t want to die? Let&#x2019;s talk after there are a few more holes in your body. Shoot him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk took off his coat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Dozens of primed explosives, dynamite, could be seen around his body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Didn&#x2019;t I say to stop moving?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaack!&#x201D; It&#x2019;s a bomb!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone in the room screamed.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>TL Note:&#xA0;</strong>Please read this <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">announcement post.</a></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
