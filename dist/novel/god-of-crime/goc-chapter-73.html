<p><span style="">Chapter 73 - Huge Reward #2 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The man stared at the doll with adoring eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the dark room, the doll&#x2019;s&#x2019; eyes stared back from where they were sitting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Its flesh was milky white, and its glistening hair gently swayed in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll fix all the broken parts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man unknowingly brought his nose to the doll&#x2019;s hair and deeply inhaled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah... Smells good...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In particular, it was the doll&#x2019;s large black eyes that caught the man&#x2019;s heart.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was shimmering with a deep light that was charming enough to suck him in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof...! Oof...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man touched the doll&#x2019;s chin as it tried to speak.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems that I need more tools to fix you properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man exited his studio and started the car, a big van for a single man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had purchased this a while ago for some hidden uses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how crazy for dolls the man was, he had to be careful about other people&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">On the surface, the dolls looked exactly like humans, and strange misunderstandings could occur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man went to the nearest store and bought sunglasses before roaming around to a store in order to find a suitable tool.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a salesperson came up to him and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Customer-nim. Are you looking for something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m looking for a stainless steel saw. It should be a big one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It will be in the F-10 section.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, that&apos;s right. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">With the help of the salesperson, he could easily buy what he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Along with the stainless steel saw, he bought iron pipes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, he bought a tarp large enough to cover a small room and a plastic container large enough for someone to enter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Finally, he also purchased a travel bag.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he went up to the counter to pay.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How will you pay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cash.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When combined, the cash was over 400,000 won.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you have a points card?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Would you like a cash receipt?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no need.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man replied bluntly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you planning to travel somewhere? Do you want me to deliver it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man spoke with an expression that seemed to warn the cashier to not interfere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will move it. I brought a car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cashier at the checkout looked at the man with a strange glance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was no need to worry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to buy this, he had deliberately headed to another city that was several hundred kilometres away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was a problem, then his whereabouts wouldn&#x2019;t be easily found.</span></p><p><span style="">The man loaded the things onto his van with a satisfied expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He drove the car thinking about how to fix the doll.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, cut off the legs so that it can&#x2019;t escape. In order to prevent the hands from doing anything bad...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man returned to his workplace with a smile on his face at the pleasant thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The doll he wanted so much was waiting for him.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk arrived at the scene where the mutilated bodies were found.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but you can&#x2019;t come in here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A man in a police uniform blocked the road.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out his police badge and showed it to the officer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am Detective Cho Kang-suk from Kangdong Police Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, thank you for your trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is Investigator Joo Hyun-ho inside?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Please come this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After entering the restaurant with the police officer, he saw Joo Hyun-ho talking to a staff member.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah! Sunbae! This is a big hit, it is quite brilliant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho greeted him with a cheerful face that was unsuitable for the crime scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. It is wrong to say such a thing here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. What about you? Anyway, we aren&#x2019;t the only ones here. Hurry and listen to the explanation. By the way, what is that doing there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho tapped his head with his fingers and Kang-suk realized what it meant as he reached for his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had failed to remove the Santa hat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seemed to be having a good time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, describe the case. What&apos;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, why did Sunbae suddenly come? I asked Coroner Park for support because of a lack of manpower. Sunbae didn&#x2019;t need to come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aish. I am just a little anxious about something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk caught Hyun-ho in a headlock.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kek, kek! I-I surrender!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At this point, Kang-suk thought that this guy might be enjoying it.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho gave a simple overview of the case.</span></p><p><span style="">The body...</span></p><p><span style="">No, the first one who found it was a staff member at the restaurant where they were gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He went to work at dawn to clean up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He said he had been cleaning the overnight snow when he found a Christmas tree that was decorated with arms and legs.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s expression changed as he listened to Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s story.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy... How many were killed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There were five arms and seven legs... There are at least four people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s mouth twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you mean at least four people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That... The explanation is a bit long. Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, tell me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are seven legs, so there are at least four people. What does Sunbae think is the psychology of a person who commits a mutilation murder?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;They are making it smaller so the body is easier to handle?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Something like that. First of all, people often go mad for a while when committing murder. However, when a body is mutilated, the mental state stays extremely rational.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy. Then the person who did this is sane?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Even if someone kills a person accidentally, they can&#x2019;t accidentally cut people up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho said in a casual voice like he was exchanging small talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t help sighing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, the psychology of a person who kills and then mutilates is quite simple. They want to return to a normal life in some way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um... They killed a person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He suddenly felt like a gangster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt wrong today.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They want to get rid of the body in front of them, so they throw it into the sea or bury it on a mountain. In short, they want it to go unnoticed in society.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A question popped into Kang-suk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So why cut it off? You can get rid of the body without doing that. Rather, it would take more time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho used his fingers to make gestures of his arms and legs being cut off.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The reason for a mutilation murder is very simple. They think that cutting that the body into smaller pieces is easier to carry and less noticeable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t want to know this about the psychology of criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But this case is unusual.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Because they were used to decorate a tree?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It isn&#x2019;t typical for a normal mutilation killer. It&#x2019;s like he is boasting of his crime... Did you hear about the person who cut off and kept the body parts of the people that they killed in the war?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What...? There are also such people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like this killer is proud that he murdered so many people. Ah, that is why I said there were at least four victims. That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He ran out of space to decorate the Christmas tree.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Either way, this isn&#x2019;t an ordinary murderer. I&apos;ll try a simple profile. He is probably a fairly educated professional in his early to mid 30s. He cares a lot about his appearance, and in addition, he has a large desire to show off. Did I talk about the loot? He thinks what he does is a work of art. That is why he made a sculpture to show off to others. It is similar to an avant-garde performer using dolls... I don&#x2019;t remember exactly but I saw it in a magazine. Haha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dolls?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Doing strange things like cutting off the arms and legs of the dolls and switching them around. There was a surprisingly good response to it. The exhibition wasn&#x2019;t long ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes sharpened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you find out more about that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm... I don&#x2019;t think it would have anything to do with this incident.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, if Sunbae says so then I&#x2019;ll try.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Have the identities of any of the victims been discovered yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The coroner Park Min-soo is in charge of that. It looks like the results haven&#x2019;t come out yet. You call him, as I am a little uncomfortable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You just don&#x2019;t fit with him. Anyway, I will call...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk called Park Min-soo to see if he confirmed any of the identities.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Uh, yes. Thank you. Work hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The conversation didn&#x2019;t last long.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho asked Kang-suk with an expression similar to a child receiving a gift.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Were the identities of the victims revealed?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Min-soo says that it will be difficult to accurately identify them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk scratched his head with a rough hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Putting aside the legs, won&#x2019;t the hands have fingerprints? I don&#x2019;t think he erased the fingerprints with something like hydrochloric acid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Korean citizens had all 10 fingerprints registered as data which was used to determine the identity of the victim, as well as to arrest the criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was often a tremendous help in the investigation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Sunbae? Are you crying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...What? Dust just entered my eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, please tell me. Otherwise I can&#x2019;t do my job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked at Joo Hyun-ho with red eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His expression was a mixture of many emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unfortunately, all the fingerprints weren&#x2019;t registered.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa! Then perhaps...&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk punched the wall with an angry expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Fuck. Yes. It means that all the victims were underage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Hyun-ho could know what it was like to be able to kill someone with sheer force.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the criminal in the case appeared in front of Kang-suk right now, he would die instantly.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;First of all, let&#x2019;s think about why I was notified of Doll Play just now.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started to slowly analyze the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first thing that happened was Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s disappearance, who lived at St. Mary&#x2019;s Orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After gathering to listen to the details of the story, Kang-suk suddenly received news that a murder had happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After that, Tae-hyuk received the notification to resolve the Doll Play situation.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s disappearance had to do with the mutilation murder case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was right to interpret the two things as being related.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, Kang-suk would soon find out more about the mutilation murders.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he would focus on solving Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s disappearance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In short, it was a division of labor.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to get some clues from Hye-mi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you called Hye-mi? Hello. I am Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was ignored, but that wasn&#x2019;t enough to make Tae-hyuk give up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um. In fact, I also care about the missing Soo-bin. I want you to help me find her. Can you tell me anything?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew how to persuade this type of girl.&#xA0;</span><span style="">To this end, he created a poor atmosphere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He whistled and shook,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hwii~ if Hye-mi doesn&#x2019;t help then I guess I have to look for myself. But if I find her myself, why don&#x2019;t I ask for a kiss? Why are girls attracted to bad guys? Who knows what I will suggest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi&#x2019;s face turned white at my words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Stop. I understand. I&#x2019;ll help you find Unni. Just please, no kiss...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt a lump in his chest at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was he such a bad person?&#xA0;</span><span style="">So far, the only magic that he used...</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi fidgeted with her fingers and started talking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll tell you first. I live with Soo-bin unni at this orphanage, but we aren&#x2019;t orphans. Don&#x2019;t be mistaken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I met Unni for the first time at the Emergency Relief Centre.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi and Soo-bin, two victims of domestic violence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These victims had the nickname of DV.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
