<p><span style="">Chapter 163 - God of Crime #5</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah? Ah? Ahh? Failure? Failureeee?! Me? Never! I didn&#x2019;t fail! Don&#x2019;t talk such nonsense! It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you are a guest! Don&#x2019;t!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The moment was enormous enough to break down a mountain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was just an old man with a burnt body, and his only weapons were a penknife and an iron skewer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t win against Tae-hyuk, who had fought numerous criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Machina.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sent a signal and the robotic arm inside his backpack extended, punching the Clown in the face.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown literally flew back and hit the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He got up and exclaimed,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This! M-Machina! H-How do you have it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, this? I got a lot of sponsorship and received one. It is easy to clean myself in the bathroom now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huuuuuck!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown moved his gaze and watched Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown felt instinctively that he couldn&#x2019;t beat the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the Clown and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can&#x2019;t win against me even if you mobilize all your people. Killing you here will be the most neat way to end this, but I&#x2019;m not comfortable with that. I will stun you and take you to the police.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk struggled because the Clown knew his identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the opponent was completely crazy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyway, he was no longer active as Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he stayed quite than the Clown would just be treated as a madman.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately raised the Machine in a threatening manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Clown, this is checkmate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the Clown commanded the pierrots.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hikikikikik! You ignored what I cherished the most! Then! Yesss! This time, I will take your most precious thing... Thing! My cute little pierrots! Seo Ha-ran over there...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kuk! T-this bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Not even one second passed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All sorts of ideas passed through Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the worst situation.</span></p><p><span style="">He had purposely talked about something else in order to turn the Clown&#x2019;s attention away from Seo Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it the wrong choice?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Would it have been better to obtain Seo Ha-ran first, even if there was a little risk?&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the Clown&#x2019;s command was completed, then Seo Ha-ran would be in danger.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one way to stop it right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to kill the Clown...</span></p><p><span style="">N-No. He couldn&#x2019;t become that monster again...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then what about Ha-ran?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop right there, Director Go Ah-tae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His accelerated throughts stopped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly turned his head and looked at the entrance of the laboratory. There was a man holding a gun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Y-You.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown was so confused that he shut his mouth before issuing the order to kill Seo Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fortunately, it seems like I made it in time. Um, is that Phantom over there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Detective Cho Kang-suk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk narrowed his eyes as he looked around the roo. Then he discovered Ha-ran tied up among the pierrots.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His eyes trembled for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, his pistol was still aiming at the Clown.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked at Tae-hyuk wearing the phantom mask and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I never thought I would meet you here... I was looking for the whereabouts of my missing fiancee. Is it a bingo?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes. It is nice timing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk showed up to save Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t give any hints, but Kang-suk discovered this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the Clown didn&#x2019;t give orders, then the pierrots wouldn&#x2019;t do anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he did anything even slightly suspicious then Kang-suk would fire his gun.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk suddenly asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But how did you get here? There were clearly guards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? There was no one?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Detective Cho Kang-suk, your luck is really good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahat! I will take it as a compliment. At any rate, Director Go Ah-tae. I will arrest you on charges of kidnapping, etc.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kiik! Kikikik! Me? I will get arrested? I have to complete my research that will bring a new prosperity to mankind!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed loudly and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You might have been that before, but now you are just an ugly criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;C-C-Criminal? Me?! Criminal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown fell into a state of cognitive dissonance and became restless.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk spoke to Phantom,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but it is hard for me to move. Can you help me with the kidnapped woman over there? I will definitely pay it back. Well, my actions might be a little bit illegal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk seemed to perfectly think that Tae-hyuk was Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded and went over to Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pierrots didn&#x2019;t receive any orders so they just gave a low moan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran was tied up but he couldn&#x2019;t see any . It seemed like she had taken something similar to a sleeping pill.</span></p><p><span style="">He shook her body a few times before she started blinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How you regained consciousness?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...T-Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with panic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am Phantom. I&apos;m sorry but I think you mistook me for someone else.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Huh... No matter the situation, do you think I wouldn&#x2019;t recognize you, even if you were wearing a mask? Oh, t-this place is dangerous! Get away from here quickly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...We&#x2019;ll talk more later. Just stay still for a moment. It is hard to untie you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk would worry about what to tell Ha-ran after successfully rescuing her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But first, they had to get out of here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk, who was confronting the Clown, shouted with a loud voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Director Go Ah-tae, don&#x2019;t run away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, the Clown started running towards the Core Drive in the centre of the lab.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The confused Kang-suk pulled the trigger of his gun.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cough!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If a culprit was trying to escape then the first place to shoot was the legs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown ignored the blood dripping down his legs and headed into the Core Drive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It happened so quickly that Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t respond properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown manipulated a panel and triggered something.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuooooong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The inside of the Core Drive turned red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The plasma started to rotate around around the Clown&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kiik! Kikikikikik! Kuhahahaha! I have activated the Core Drive! I will prove to everyone that my research hasn&#x2019;t failed! Now from here! The human race! It will be a step towards evolution!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown danced with joy behind the tank made of tempered glass.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The situation inside the Core Drive wasn&#x2019;t clear so Kang-suk fired at the Clown.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop what you are doing and get out of there! Damn! It is tempered glass!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was also confused.</span></p><p><span style="">[Caution!]</span></p><p><span style="">-The Spying skill has detected a danger.</span></p><p><span style="">-The special ability has been triggered and 20 affinity points have been reduced.</span></p><p><span style="">-Amount of time remaining until the Core Drive explodes&#x2015;.</span></p><p><span style="">-00:10:09&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Core Drive explosion?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then what about the Psychotropic Incense?&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, what big explosion?</span></p><p><span style="">There was no doubt that it would be dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho Kang-suk! Drag that clown out! He wants to blow this place up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk made a horrified expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn! I can&#x2019;t die along with that bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took Ha-ran to the entrance of the laboratory and gave her the route to get out of here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he ran to the Clown and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Clown! What will happen if the Core Drive explodes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kikikik! That is impossible! My research was a success! Just stay there and watch the birth of the best invention in human history!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tell me just in case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuk, kukuk. The Core Drive is an antimatter that generates infinite energy. If it explodes, then it will have the energy of one or two hydrogen bombs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You were studying such a dangerous thing here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry! My research! Definitely! It is successful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was dangerous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This place was dangerous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was why the study was frozen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn! I will make you stop this!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;St-op? Stop? Stop?! I won&#x2019;t do it! I won&#x2019;t let anyone interfere with my research! Kuhahat! Kuhahahat! The Core Drive is a success! It is successful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s face turned pale as he heard the story from the side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom... Is that really what Director Go Ah-tae said?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It seems so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn! I will call reinforcements right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are only 10 minutes left. We have no choice but to resolve this by ourselves.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I don&#x2019;t know how much damage the blast will cause. Can we stop the bomb? Damn... Turn off that machine right now! Or else I will kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown ignored Kang-suk&#x2019;s desperate words and declared triumphantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kukuk... It seems like this is the only thing I can do to prevent the Core Drive from being stopped.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown closed his eyes and stabbed his chest with the iron skewer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown laughed even when he was dying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My research is definitely a success! A success! Su...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a pointless death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes filled with despair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He sat on the floor and knocked against the tempered glass with a bitter face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn... Dying like this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Detective Cho Kang-suk. I will try it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am Phantom. Turning this machine off is simple.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I believe you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you. If you go outside, then Seo Ha-ran will be waiting. Get her out of here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk nodded slowly with a firm expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom was a criminal, but he didn&#x2019;t seem the type to lie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once Kang-suk left, Phantom... No, Seo Tae-hyuk muttered in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, what can I do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, he sent Kang-suk and Ha-ran out of here, but the problem was from now on.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t stop the Core Drive then serious damage might occur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t have any luck then the Psychotropic Incense might leak outside the lab.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then it would literally be like a zombie movie.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk first collected the remaining Psychotropic Incense left in the institute and gve it to the pierrots.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Get out of here right now. Head to the nearest hospital.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Un-der-stood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pierrots started to move according to the orders that Tae-hyuk gave.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, Tae-hyuk was left alone in the laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I use the Machine then I can break through that tempered glass. However, if I install a bomb...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk was in distress, someone approached him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at them with confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, you went outside... N-Noona?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A smiling Seo Ha-ran was standing there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She said to him,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a dangerous situation... Is there no time to explain it again?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I couldn&#x2019;t move my body, but my mind was fine the whole time. I heard the entire conversation between Tae-hyuk and Go Ah-tae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N-Noona...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I absolutely won&#x2019;t tell the &#x2018;truth&#x2019; to anyone. No, it will be fine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran smiled and reached out to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. Do you have anything to break that tank and stop the equipment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t look like that. Noona...it will be okay. I&#x2019;m not scared at all. I mean, I&#x2019;ll do it. Sister will stop it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes flashed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was saying that she would sacrifice herself with such a pure expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, yes...&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had seen this look before.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-From now on, I will be your mother and father.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Ever since then, Ha-ran had sacrificed herself for them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Noona. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is need to be sorry! I&#x2019;m doing this because I like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Pushuk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sprinkled some of the Psychotropic Incense in Ha-ran&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her eyes instantly relaxed and she became a puppet who would listen to anything Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Run away from here. And together with Cho Kang-suk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He paused for a moment and looked at Ha-ran&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yes, he came here because he wanted to see a smile on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Finally, he ordered Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Live happily for a long time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Un-der-stood... Ah, no, T-Tae-hyuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Despite being affected by the Psychotropic Incense, she called out the name of her brother until the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But she couldn&#x2019;t disobey the command and left the laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were only four minutes remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What was the condition for upgrading to the &#x2018;God of Crime&#x2019;?</span></p><p><span style="">Acquiring one million affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe the Core Drive exploding would emit a bigger energy than he imagined?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yes, there were one million people in the city.</span></p><p><span style="">The condition for acquiring affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Changing someone&#x2019;s fate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Killing a person who should&#x2019;ve lived, or saving a person who should&#x2019;ve died.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe the God of Crime was...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t help sighing.</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t afraid.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been destined to die from the death penalty anyway.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had returned to the past to create a new relationship and to change his sister&#x2019;s despairing face into a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, this was enough.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was satisfied.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly muttered as he watched the Clown lying on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The crime skills. The evil that exists in the world is gathered and given shape. If a person&#x2019;s mind is weak then they will get corrupted by it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The numerous criminals that he met popped into his head. He had learnt their abilities in the form of the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pickpockets, scammers, kidnappers, murderers, thieves, gangs and the mafia. Their malice gathered and a monster was born. But... Humans who will sacrifice themselves for others exist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran devoted everything to her brothers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Hye-mi and Cho Kang-suk as well...</span></p><p><span style="">The world wasn&#x2019;t simply filled with malice.</span></p><p><span style="">He slowly raised his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was different from the future, where he was falsely charged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, he would change the fates of one million people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, among them...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Sacrificing himself for somebody else? He wasn&#x2019;t such a great person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used to be on death row.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now, he was a criminal who committed numerous crimes.</span></p><p><span style="">So...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At best, I am just trying to be the God of Crime.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
