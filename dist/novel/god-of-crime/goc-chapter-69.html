<p><span style="">Chapter 69 - DATE HARD 2.0 #2 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran returned home on the weekend.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She ran over without gloves, so her hands were red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time she opened her mouth, a white plume of steamy breath billowed out.</span></p><p><span style="">She opened the front door and trembled,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk, s-sorry. Is Noona late? Are you hungry? I&#x2019;ll cook you delicious food at once!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran took off her coat and ran to the kitchen, but there was an unexpected scene awaiting her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her younger brother was cooking in the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Noona came? It&#x2019;s cold out, so sit down and rest. You&#x2019;ve been studying for a long time so I will prepare dinner tonight.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An apron-clad Tae-hyuk carried food to the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first glance, there were many things that looked delicious.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran looked at Tae-hyuk with an impressed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It will only take another 10 minutes. Before that, warm up your body. There is hot water in the bathroom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes. I came home. My Tae-hyuk is all grown up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Ms. Go in and wash your body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran picked clothes from her room and entered the bathroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hot water came out, even in the winter.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In their old room in the basement, the boiler would be frozen, if it was only slightly cold outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, she had to boil water with a portable burner for her younger brothers and clean with lukewarm water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She also had a brief shower with freezing cold water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was cold enough in winter to make her stunned.</span></p><p><span style="">Her eyes turned red as she remembered those times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A smile came to her face as she bathed in warm water.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, shall I see how good my little brother is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a variety of dishes on the table, such as steak and salad. There were also California rolls that looked appetizing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were all Ha-ran&#x2019;s favorite foods.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, these things were expensive and not easily eaten.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Wah. Tae-hyuk prepared all of this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, a friend helped me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Girlfriend?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, we just study together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahum. I see. You should bring some back for them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, An Eun-young had prepared most of these dishes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk only cut the cabbage, roasted the meat in the oven, and placed it in bowls.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know if this will suit Chef Seo Ha-ran, but let&#x2019;s eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. But I can&#x2019;t eat so much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will wrap the leftovers and give it to Tae-min.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-min still hasn&#x2019;t finished?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He won&#x2019;t be done until 10 p.m.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran chatted as they started to eat.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran sliced the steak and was pleasantly surprised.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The knife smoothly sunk into the meat, as if she was cutting through tofu.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She could feel that the meat was of the finest quality.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The red flesh and white fat layer were in perfect harmony.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The steak looked so delicious that saliva filled her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran asked gently.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This seems very expensive...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t slice the meat. He just tore it with his mouth and spoke while chewing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, the local butcher store was having a sale. It wasn&#x2019;t that expensive so feel free to eat.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it was an absolute lie.</span></p><p><span style="">The identity of the meat was Kobe beef, one of the top three wagyu in Japan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was also the most expensive Chateau brand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a dish that boasted a price of over 100,000 won per person, even if it was just the cheap lunch menu.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran cut it into small pieces and raised it to her mouth without knowing it was such an expensive meat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Wah... So delicious...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The rich juices ran down her chin as Ha-ran started to energetically eat the steak.</span></p><p><span style="">Next, her fork headed towards the salmon salad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran was baffled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were unidentified black things sprinkled into the salad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When she looked closely, they seemed to be fish eggs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What type of fish egg is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I got it in a 1+1 sale at the mart. It is delicious when eaten with salmon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t know that the fish eggs were caviar, one of the three great delicacies that caught the taste of gourmets all around the world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just seven ounces of it were sold for an exorbitant price of over $500.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That precious food was now being eaten with salmon salad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Although it is a little salty... It is unbelievably delicious, and completely changes the flavor of the salmon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran made a sound of admiration with every bite of food.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is okay. There is still a lot left so we can eat it with some rice tomorrow morning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;These ingredients seem expensive...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aish. They are cheap.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s eyes narrowed and she sent him a suspicious glance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk just smiled like he didn&#x2019;t know anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had been a long time since he last met his sister, so he wanted to give her the best foods.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people faced each other and smiled brightly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, Noona can just study hard and not worry about money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That sounds like something I used to say.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran twisted her brother&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk once again swore to himself after seeing his sister smiling so brightly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t make his sister unhappy unlike the previous life.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the only favor that Tae-hyuk could do for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right. Kang-suk hyung says to expect a date. He is preparing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo. Kang-suk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;m sure it will be the best date.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran blinked.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t show it on the outside, but it seemed like she was expected a lot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The concept of this date isn&#x2019;t Beauty and the Beast, but Cinderella...! The problem is whether Kang-suk hyung can do this properly. If it was Beauty and the Beast then he could do well as the beast.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The actors were ready, but he was worried about how well Cho Kang-suk could do.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">In the base of the Nuclear Bomb, the second ranked Kang Han-seong stared at his juniors with cold eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung-nim helped you... It wasn&#x2019;t for you to look like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His position in the circle wasn&#x2019;t low.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rather, his charisma and strong power made him one of the high ranking members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only thing he was lacking in was his amount of contacts.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, Kang Han-seong desperately tried to increase the number of his followers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he added just five more people, then he could become a captain of Nuclear Bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had no intention of being underneath someone in a gang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He planned to grow it as much as possible and turn it into an organization.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he would do his job, but once he was recognized, he would be able to relax from a high position.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The juniors he gathered were his footholds to success.</span></p><p><span style="">But what were these pathetic brats?&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to join the group, they had to be able to take money and then hand the money over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They roamed around this area for that reason.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So... You were beaten up by one person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong caught the eye of a nearby junior, who had one arm in a cast.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t go to the toilet alone.</span></p><p><span style="">The sight was enough to make Kang Han-seong sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">His juniors bowed their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. I-If that bastard didn&#x2019;t have the iron pipe then... He is a cowardly bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong struck the cheek of his pathetic junior.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, you jerk. Is that something to be proud of? Aigoo. I can&#x2019;t believe I invested in scum like this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hyung-nim!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The juniors clung to Kang Han-seong and bowed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how pathetic, they were still people who followed him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s heart weakened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand, you brats. This strong Kang Han-seong will solve it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thank you. I swear allegiance to Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m getting goosebumps. Stop before you make me sick. Yes, he was wearing the uniform of A High School?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right. It is a school in the area. I am sure he goes to that school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A High School was a famous school nearby, not necessarily as a prestigious school, but for the second generation of good families attending it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, it had an ambiguous position.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, their money entered the wallets of this gang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if the school had a good fighter, then he should check it out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once they met, Kang Han-seong would see about bringing him into Nuclear Bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he did have an iron pipe, he had fought four people alone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He might not be a good guy. So let&#x2019;s act in moderation and go to A High School.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hyung-nim, then we...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. I&#x2019;m not your mother. Handle this yourself. Wipe your feet and go home and sleep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand. Thank you, Hyung-nim.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong sighed and started to investigate A High School.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Oh, it must be Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></i> <i><span style="">But he isn&#x2019;t 1st in the school.</span></i> <i><span style="">He did a test a while ago and was ranked 2nd.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, is that so?</span></i> <i><span style="">Then who is 1st?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That...</span></i> <i><span style="">An Eun-young.</span></i> <i><span style="">She is completely crazy (about studying).</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hah.</span></i> <i><span style="">That female is good (at fighting)? </span></i><span style="">[TL: the words in brackets are implied but aren&#x2019;t actually said.]</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Completely brilliant.</span></i> <i><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk is her apprentice.</span></i> <i><span style="">He can&#x2019;t even compete with An Eun-young.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...H-Hyung-nim! I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. It really was like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong glared at his henchmen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is someone bigger than him? In addition, a woman?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu, I see. I guess I have to believe what you are saying. What type of person is she?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong imagined Arnold Schwarzenegger with long hair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, his palms became damp.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I guess I should take a look for myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like it would become a mess if he left the job to his henchmen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Kang Han-seong decided to go himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So, where is that person called Tae-hyuk now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A henchman stuttered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was hesitant about something.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong muttered with annoyance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you to know for sure!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. I know.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Where?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard he is at a restaurant cafe in the suburbs right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a restaurant popular with couples.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong was currently sitting in a factory where the heat wasn&#x2019;t working properly and he was surrounded with the smell of stinky men.</span></p><p><span style="">What, a date?</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s lips twitched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The suburbs were usually deserted, and thus, it wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem if he wanted to beat someone up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is playing very wildly on Christmas Eve. Are 10 people available right now? We have to take care of that bastard, even if we get in trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong chuckled.</span></p><p><span style="">They were still minors, so they wouldn&#x2019;t be punished properly, even if they damaged the restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The laws protected them.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he would punish that bastard who ridiculed four of his men.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is me. Gather immediately. From now on, we will start a war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong mobilized all the strong people.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk asked nervously as he gazed at the suit that was tailored to his body.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised a thumb.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah... You look really cool. It is like a drama.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The custom made Oxford suit with a expensive price of three million won transformed the bear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? But this clings to my body too much. If a criminal suddenly appeared...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Kang-suk hyung! You should only think about dating today!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk smiled as he placed a handkerchief in his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, the booked limousine will soon come. Then you will go pick up Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought of the bleak days where he just caught criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never once had a date, yet Tae-hyuk had prepared everything perfectly.</span></p><p><span style="">He really was the best brother.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk prepared everything: His clothes, his transportation, and even his reservation at the restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made Kang-suk practice all of the scripts until he memorized them completely.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung. I&apos;ll be watching from afar. Don&#x2019;t tremble. Have a good time with Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two men gazed at each other warmly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Soon, a gorgeous limo arrived in front of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he would go and meet the princess.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as Kang-suk went to pick up Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nevertheless, doesn&#x2019;t a prince need a villain?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew that the gang he just met were looking for him so he had deliberately leaked information and even bribed people to spread rumors for the past three days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, there was going to be a fight today.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Indeed, Kang-suk was the best when catching criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, what if he fought to defend the princess?</span></p><p><span style="">A wonderful scene from a fairy tale would come out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The actors were gathering without knowing they were being used.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it will be the best date.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
