<p><span style="">Chapter 114: The Price of their Sins #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The dawn of a war didn&#x2019;t mean that there would be an armed conflict.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, if the power on both sides was equal, then the standoff would just persist.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho, the leader of the prisoners, built his base in the logistics warehouse.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a bunch of dangerous items that could be used as weapons.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, the access of the inmates was strictly controlled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Several layers of security had to be passed through to enter it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Without Cigarette Seller&#x2019;s help, they wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to obtain the weapons so easily.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho emphasized the most important facts to his men.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keep the armed conflict to a minimum. I know that your hearts are heating up, but show some restraint.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If anybody else gave these instructions then complaints would be popping out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Shin Chang-ho was the man who reigned over the other inmates with his charisma and future status in the organization.&#xA0;</span><span style="">None of the prisoners refused his orders.</span></p><p><span style="">A simple barricade was made at the entrance with furniture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prisoners took up positions behind it as if they were trained soldiers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t that difficult since the majority of them had gone to the army.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That experience really helped in this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a command room in a corner of the dining room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From there, Shin Chang-ho and Seo Tae-hyuk looked at the prisoners working.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cigarette Seller. Is this enough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is very wonderful. The time limit is 72 hours, which is when the guard shift changes. If we hang on until then, victory will be ours.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho gave a low groan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Would it work out as well as planned?&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was better than doing nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">In this place, Tae-hyuk was the criminal Kim Cheol-su.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His eyes shone with the madness unique to psychopaths.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even Shin Chang-ho, who had lived in the back alleys for more than a decade, was surprised at how frightening he was.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are the other inmates doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Most of them are waiting for this war to end soon and are in their cells.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">If they exited, then there was a possibility of getting involved.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the prisoners chose to stay in their cells despite the fact that there were no guards watching over them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you already, but the reason I am cooperating with you is because I need your help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You want Park Sung-yul to be interrogated for information?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. If you succeed, you will also get what you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he said the meaningful words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know why Cigarette Seller was so hostile to Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t need to know.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt sorry for Park Sung-yul, but he had to accept Cigarette Seller&#x2019;s offer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand. I know someone who will do a good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a pleased face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a while, the bandaged Park Joon-shik appeared in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry but I want you to do something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik wanted to make up for starting the war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that opportunity came sooner than he thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know Park Sung-yul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, that gloomy bastard?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. There is something I need you to find out from him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Find out the identities of the people he killed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik closed his mouth and a serious expression appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he required a convincing explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, it is an unwritten law here not to care about what a person did outside. But there is a personal grudge against him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were short words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, that was enough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. I will find out what you want quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik hit his chest with a confident expression and he disappeared towards the cells.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He definitely was a man of great ability.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked from where he was watching on the sidelines.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t see any special skills in that area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to worry. Although Joon-shik looks like that, he is very good at torturing people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a compliment that wasn&#x2019;t a compliment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho added to emphasize his meaning.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;His skills are enough to work at the NIS.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um, the NIS.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were really trustworthy words.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul was quietly resting in his cell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Something was happening outside, but it didn&#x2019;t have anything to do with him.</span></p><p><span style="">How could he improve the puzzles that he had completed?&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was the only thing he was concentrating on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... The eighth puzzle is really good. I think that Cho Kang-suk will like it a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, he would&#x2019;ve sent his second puzzle by now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, since last week, all postal services in the prison were suspended.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the first time it happened but it wasn&#x2019;t a problem.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be normal anyway. The letter could be sent at any time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only the police would become frustrated.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Knock knock.</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, someone knocked on the door of his cell and looked inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a single room without a roommate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person who was looking this way...</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul made a confused sound as he confirmed the identity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Park Joon-shik?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was one of the people following Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, there aren&#x2019;t any guards so I was wondering how you got in. The door is open.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik smiled as he entered and sat on the bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Sung-yul wanted to get rid of him straight away, but his size was too large to deal with.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik was holding the scissors used for cutting hair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Sung-yul spoke with reluctance,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The other person was famous in the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But for Park Sung-yul, they were just crows crowding around rotten meat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When compared to himself...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are resting so I&#x2019;m sorry. In fact, I absolutely don&#x2019;t have any bad feelings towards you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik opened and closed the scissors with his fingers in the handle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time it opened and closed, there was a distinctive metallic sound.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung-nim seems interested in you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik was injured, so one arm didn&#x2019;t move properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, one hand was enough to deal with weaklings.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-W-What do you want to do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s eyes trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Are you afraid? But isn&#x2019;t it funny? I know you killed a lot of people before coming here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik smiled and aimed the scissors at Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Blood spurted as a scream burst from Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The people you brutally killed were weaker than you. Now that the situation is the opposite, you are crying out with a very cute voice. Disgusting bastard. But I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik placed the opponent&#x2019;s fingers between the scissors handles and twisted lightly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bones were twisted and the fingers bend in a strange direction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Joon-shik looked at his work with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I am the same.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, Park Joon-shik started his one hour torture.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What, why...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s whole body was bloody.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he learnt that scissors could be used to give pain in many different ways.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then this is enough warm up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul glared at the other person. Now his legs would weaken every time he heard the sound of the scissors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Joon-shik was an expert in torture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was very simple to dig at the weak parts of the target&#x2019;s psychology.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to do that, he had to put the other person in an extreme situation without giving reasons for the torture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...T-This, the reason...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul begged.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Park Joon-shik constantly tormented his target.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By this time, Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s reaction had weakened.</span></p><p><span style="">He realized that it was time to move on.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Joon-shik placed his fingers in the handle of the scissors.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, I&apos;ve only twisted it so far. Aren&#x2019;t scissors used to cut things off? So I should try that out now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s body trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Don&#x2019;t! I&apos;ll do whatever you say...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. It has been a fun time. By the way, do you know what the basis of torture is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I, don&#x2019;t, know...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik twisted two fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Work in opposition, and absolutely never kill the opponent. Make it as painful as possible without the person dying. This is surprisingly difficult. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik brought his mouth to the ears of the trembling Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he whispered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I&#x2019;m used to cutter knives and needles. This is my first time using scissors, so I might accidentally cut some things off that I shouldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ll ask for your understanding in advance.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aaaaacck!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A pained scream echoed in the cell.</span></p><p><span style="">Two hours had passed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Joon-shik looked at Park Sung-yul with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah. This is a human cultural asset. You can still breathe without being in danger of dying. But won&#x2019;t it get really dangerous if you don&#x2019;t receive treatment soon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...K, kuoock, kuooock.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you want to live then answer my questions from now on. Of course, you have the right to refuse. But every time you do, something precious will be cut off one by one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik smiled brightly and winked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And Park Sung-yul realized.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the Blue Dragon prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no one normal inside.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was happily shopping while waiting for Park Joon-shik to gather the information.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a variety of tools in the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Detergent to clean the inside of the prison, and fertilizer to grow drugs on the farms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, there were very toxic pesticides to lower the amount of labor the prison would have to mobilize.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gathered all of them and checked the note that Kim Tae-sung had given him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He can make a bomb using these ingredients. What a great person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">To make a bomb, various chemicals such as: potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, ammonium nitrate and sulfuric acid were needed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were classified as accident-prone goods and were not readily available on the market.</span></p><p><span style="">But curiously, most of these things were stored in the warehouse of the Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, they needed to be separated from the fertilizer to be used.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would give the materials to Kim Tae-sung and let him take care of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this ammonium nitrate? Is the warden completely crazy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a chemical that exploded easily when exposed to high temperatures or combustible materials.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is this used to make ice packs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Summer was coming to Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be best if there were air conditioners, but it was hard to expect such products of civilization.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, the prisoners were offered ice packs. It was a necessary medicine.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked around and discovered bleach used to wash the sweat and dust from the guards&#x2019; uniforms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Potassium chlorate could be extracted from that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With these materials, a bomb could be created that would blow up one of these rooms.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If there are more materials, then he&#x2019;ll be able to create an even bigger bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the materials inside the prison were limited.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the first place, a bomb with huge explosive power wasn&#x2019;t necessary.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is enough to just have fireworks. The prisoners... No, I will use it as a salute to signify the victory of the prisoners.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and kept collecting the materials that Bomber had written down.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik would come back soon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he could gather everything he needed.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
