<p><span style="">Chapter 104 - Pieces of the Puzzle #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">There was a newcomer arriving on a boat.</span></p><p><span style="">The prisoners doing their exercises started to talk with a shine in their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like a Korean&#xA0;is entering.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I hope he is a Chinese.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reason why they were keen on getting a newcomer was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Depending on the nationality, the power structure inside the prison would change.</span></p><p><span style="">Blue Dragon was unusual in that it was a foreign correctional facility as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Foreign inmates were confined by nationality and religion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the Korean criminals were the most abundant, but the ratio of foreigners had begun to increase lately.</span></p><p><span style="">Here, there was power in numbers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were no idiots that would face off against a larger force.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I saw the latest news that a Chinese killer was caught. Surely he isn&#x2019;t that bastard?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought he died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. Caught.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck, we shouldn&#x2019;t have any more Chinese...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since a few years ago, the number of Chinese criminals started to increase tremendously.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most were death penalty cases, making it hard to send them back to their homeland.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So the number of Chinese inmates in Blue Dragon Prison grew steadily.</span></p><p><span style="">But if a new Chinese killer entered?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The power structure inside the prison could completely reverse.</span></p><p><span style="">One criminal with exceptional eyesight raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The newbie is entering!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The eyes of the criminals turned towards the barbed wire near the port.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t it seem to be just one person? Uh, isn&#x2019;t that the warden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Does that mean he is big enough for the warden himself to go collect him? Maybe it really is that killer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The criminal in charge of cleaning the inside of the prison said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was working near the General Affairs Department yesterday and heard something. The person entering today is Korean.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were sighs of relief from the people who were in opposition to the Chinese.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the guards, keeping an eye on the criminals in the area, yelled,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is this a zoo? Don&#x2019;t crowd around. If there is one more problem then there won&#x2019;t be exercise time this week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes~&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The gathered prisoners answered before scattering, but their eyes were still following the newbie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, they were able to see the newbie going through the entrance with a detective.</span></p><p><span style="">Someone muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t want to say this, but he looks like a fucked-up bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The prisoners listening nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Kang-suk arrived at Blue Dragon Prison and were talking to the warden.</span></p><p><span style="">The warden emphasized it again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will tell you a few times, but you have to be very careful. There are many dangerous people in this prison. If they find out that you are an investigator who infiltrated in order to get information, your life will be in danger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked relaxed like he was returning to his home.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden said in an impressed voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are really an investigator right? You seem to be very used to a place like this. I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of investigators who infiltrated here. It is the first time I&#x2019;ve seen one like Kim Cheol-su.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked like a criminal hiding his identity.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk interrupted the conversation between Tae-hyuk and the warden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t much time left until the transport departed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim, I&apos;ll go first. Thank you for doing me this favor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for coming such a long way. Then the guard will guide you out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk handed over the documents he brought to the warden and whispered to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I wish you luck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk just smiled instead of answering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Kang-suk left and there were only two people remaining in the room.</span></p><p><span style="">The first one to open his mouth was the warden.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cheol-su. Welcome to Blue Dragon Prison. I couldn&#x2019;t tell you properly while the detective was here. There are a few things I would like to ask you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the eyes of the warden shook,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you overacting this? We are the only ones here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Acting? I am originally like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden felt the breath clogging in his throat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know where Cho Kang-suk found Kim Cheol-su, but he really seemed like a criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like the warden wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough. I understand. You&#x2019;ll be put in straight away so don&#x2019;t relax. By the way, I didn&#x2019;t tell you when Detective Cho Kang-suk was here, but you should be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden didn&#x2019;t like the man called Kim Cheol-su in front of him, so the warden decided to scare him a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Be careful?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. All the prisoners here are bad guys. Don&#x2019;t forget that you will never be safe as a spy planted by the police. Ah, don&#x2019;t you already know up to here? But so far, all the spies planted here have been killed or disfigured. Cheol-su is only protected during the day. At night, you&apos;ll have to hold out alone among the beasts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a smile of satisfaction as the warden finished his story and looked at the other person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He thought this would be a suitable warning.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim doesn&#x2019;t need to worry about me.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough! Cheol-su. As warden, I can&#x2019;t take care of you. Here I am the law. Even if you don&#x2019;t know that now, you will soon find out. Then I hope you stay safe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he watched the warden&#x2019;s face reddening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, this level of provocation wasn&#x2019;t enough to faze him at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop chatting and get to the bottom line.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shall I put you in Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s sally? &#xA0;Ah, this prison is American style so I used words that aren&#x2019;t common. Sally is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is referring to the same room mate. I know that much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, you must&#x2019;ve studied a lot beforehand. There are only one or two people per room. It is different from other prisons, where people are gathered together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt like he had come home after entering this prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Put me in with Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden&#x2019;s eyes widened with surprise as Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s name came out of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-Yoo Cheol-ho?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;His room is empty. Can I hear why? Didn&#x2019;t you come to get information from Park Sung-yul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the warden with a disbelieving expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He will be suspicious if a guy, who is suddenly roomed with him, is asking him questions. Rather, it is better to get information from the people around Park Sung-yul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had thought that Cheol-su was just a brat, but he seemed surprisingly good at spying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warden called the guards and ordered them to put Kim Cheol-su as Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s cellmate.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, keep this in mind. Don&#x2019;t get involved with foreign inmates. Anyway, isn&#x2019;t it enough to get information from the Koreans?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will take that into account if possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is Kim Cheol-su&#x2019;s life at risk. Please be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After waiting a while, a patrol agent in blue clothing came into the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked straight at Tae-hyuk and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk followed the guard and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But don&#x2019;t you want to do more?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There were many foreign residents in Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were in a hostile relationship with each other, so several doors with bars on them had to be crossed to enter another area.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Breaking through the barrier was necessary to get what he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Before entering the prison, the guard stripped Tae-hyuk of his clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was because there was a chance he was concealing something like a weapon in a secret place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um. There is nothing. By the way, your body is quite small compared to the size of your head. Huhu... Then you can wear these clothes here. Your clothes will be put in a box and kept in the storage room. You will receive them again then they are released. Any questions?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head without saying anything and put on the clothes that inmates wore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he was a perfect member of Blue Dragon Prison.</span></p><p><span style="">Once he was ready, the guard took Tae-hyuk to a general cell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the A-1 zone that had the most inmates.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Number 1047, this is where you will live starting from today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was wearing a nametag with a number on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Starting today, it would be Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s default title.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard went into the deepest part of the cell and knocked on the iron door with a grate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Number 747. Have you been bored due to being alone? A roommate has come.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a sink and toilet, a small table, and bunk bed where two men could sleep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Inmates spent more than half the day in the cells.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Number 747...! Hey, Yoo Cheol-ho!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a bump on the bed where someone was lying.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the guard didn&#x2019;t hesitate to call out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the guard opened the door with a key and entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, you son of a bitch. You must be crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard pulled out the club he was wearing at his waist and tried to hit Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, Yoo Cheol-ho stretched out his hand from the futon and grabbed the guard&#x2019;s arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Next, the face popped out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu. Guard-nim. I&#x2019;m not feeling well. Check with the doctor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck, then say that! And how long will you hold my arm? Do you want to go to hell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo, I&#x2019;m sorry. I unconsciously did it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Leave it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho smirked and released the hand holding the guard&#x2019;s arm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard gestured to Tae-hyuk to come in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Number 747. Take care of this newbie. Don&#x2019;t tell him anything strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Huhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho grinned and sat up on the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, unlucky child.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard spat at the entrance before closing the cell door and disappearing somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only Tae-hyuk and Yoo Cheol-ho remained in the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho smacked his lips like a person deprived of snacks and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The guards here are very tough. They are so cute that I am going crazy. Hey Newbie, do you know who I am?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I don&#x2019;t know very well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... Your face looks like you&#x2019;ve eaten a lot of boiled rice. In any case, don&#x2019;t ask for age here. All prisoners are the same. Looking at your face, you were in a different prison for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged instead of answering.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a special prison for heinous criminals like me, so the guards are very rough. If there is even the smallest gap then they will try to half kill a person. Huhu... But you know what? No matter how strong someone pretends to be, they are fresh and white once they take off their clothes. Tearing that to shreds...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and summoned the iron pipe with the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he struck Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuheok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s eyes rolled into the back of his head and he lost consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You talk too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk carefully covered Yoo Cheol-ho with a bedspread.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Keep occupying this bed. You have a cold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had entered Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s room as planned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He told the warden that it was to investigate the people around Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk&apos;s purpose was something else.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s see how the mole dug his tunnel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he looked at Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a criminal who had already successfully escaped from prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After becoming aware of his future memories, the first thing Tae-hyuk did was catch Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a really old bond.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho was trapped in this place, that was several kilometres away from land, so that he wouldn&#x2019;t try to escape again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Yoo Cheol-ho once again succeeded in breaking out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He gained the nickname the &#x2018;King of Escape&#x2019; after that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew the method that Yoo Cheol-ho used for his second escape.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If I want to find the gold, I need to be able to roam around the prison freely. To do that, I need the tunnel created by Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used Spying to identity nearby features.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There really is a tunnel. I&#x2019;d like to draw a picture of it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had no paper or pen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s escape started behind the sink.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed a few things in order to use it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, I need to put a drug in Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s cup...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t make Yoo Cheol-ho unconscious every time with the iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t plan to escape from jail with Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk brought everything he could use inside the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, a small tool was needed to get them out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You didn&#x2019;t think I would bring it in this way, did you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he recalled the guard who body-searched him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard could never find the hidden things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared at his bulging body and touched something firm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I brought it inside my body.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
