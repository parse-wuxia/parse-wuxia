<p><span style="">Chapter 160 - God of Crime #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The Clown leaned back in his chair and made a sad expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He inspected the researchers addicted to the Psychotropic Incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a trial, he gave one of them an order to commit suicide.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuweeeeek!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The faithful slave stabbed his belly.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a fatal drawback to the Psychotropic Incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was okay for simple manual labour.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the project required doing tasks with a little more difficulty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to expect a lot from the zombies.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&#x2019;t use these things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At most, he could use them as security guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown moved his fingers and some of the researchers brought him the Psychotropic Incense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuweeeoooh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kilkil, I should use a more moderate amount of Psychotropic Incense the next time I need subordinates since these have become defective products that can&#x2019;t even speak properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were almost 100 bottles of Psychotropic Incense in the box.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could create thousands of slaves.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is possible to proceed with the Core Drive project that was frozen...! What absurd theory? If my research succeeds, then it will be an innovation that will change human life itself! Uhahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole the fire of the gods and gave it to humans.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It completely changed the lives of the humans who were living a primitive life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What about electricity, or the telephone?&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were literally revolutionary.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t need to go that far.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was easy to think about how much the Internet and smartphones had enriched human lives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With one single click, they could access anywhere in the world, at any time they wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">100 years ago, it would&#x2019;ve been called a miracle of the gods.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I will create an infinite energy called &#x2018;Core Drive&#x2019;! It will bring a new prosperity to humans! Uha, uhahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he did it, wouldn&#x2019;t the academics who ignored him look at him with astonished faces?&#xA0;</span><span style="">His heart beat wildly just thinking about it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown touched his chin and started thinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuook. I require the help of an assistant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His eyes rolled as he went through all the possibilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be anyone addicted to the incense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The right person... Ah!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The face of a freshman entered the Clown&#x2019;s mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was quite bright and he could teach her what was required to be an assistant.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown called a subordinate over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was one that had a certain degree of consciousness and could slightly communicate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is Seo Ha-ran right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That...not, h-here...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So where is she?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Gett-ing, read-y, wedding, home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhuhu, that&#x2019;s right.</span></p><p><span style="">Come to think of it, he remembered hearing something like that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like there was a fog around his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Some of his memories were hazy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. These are still the same! Yihihihit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He drummed his fingers against the keyboard in a familiar manner and the machines in the laboratory started moving.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Core Drive project was still fresh in his mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he could start his research right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I need research funds since the Core Drive doesn&#x2019;t have enough material. Ah, before that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown beckoned for a subordinate to hand him his phone and entered in a number.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Ha-ran? Hello, Clown... No, it is Go Ah-tae. I&#x2019;m sorry if you&#x2019;re busy, but I have something important to discuss with you. Can we talk for 10 minutes? No, I&#x2019;ll pick you up. You need to come here... Ah, I really appreciate it! Then I will meet you at the bus stop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown hung up and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He believed that everything he was doing was essential for the development of mankind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hihihi! Then let&#x2019;s open the circus stage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A few days passed by.</span></p><p><span style="">An article appeared on the Internet about a group of clowns attacking people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And at the same time, Seo Tae-hyuk realized why the Clown was born three years earlier than planned.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&apos;t stop his trembling hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Forgery skill showed the Clown dressed in a white coat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His eyes were familiar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had gone with his sister to the institute. Then he met a middle-aged man called Go Ah-tae.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go Ah-tae... Kwang-tae, no, Clown? What, he was the clown?&#x201D; (Wordplay since clown in Korean =Kwangdae)</span></p><p><span style="">Why hadn&#x2019;t he realized such a simple pun?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown that Tae-hyuk met in prison had a bizarre appearance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His whole body was covered in burns, and he wore clown makeup like he was trying to hid it.</span></p><p><span style="">The prison turned a blind eye to a certain extent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he wasn&#x2019;t wearing his clown makeup, then the other prisoners would be too disgusted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was no wonder that his nickname became the Clown.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought he was just called the Clown due to how he looked, but his name was actually the cause.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled everything he knew about the Clown. </span><span style="">He was in an accident and suffered massive burns to his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The impact damaged his pituitary gland that controlled reasoning and self-control, things that were essential for a normal social life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He literally became a monster that acted on instincts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the process of changing the future, I hastened the Clown&#x2019;s accident by three years. Wait a minute, that means...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face turned white.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a place that his mind went to.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Surely the Clown wasn&#x2019;t at Taesung Institute?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had blown up that place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the only explosive severe enough to cause burns that occurred recently.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough damage to blow away the whole building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t think that anyone could survive that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Clown was injured in an accident when he worked at a research institute. Then the institute is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was likely the Taesung institute that was blown up a week ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">If Go Ah-tae, the Clown, was related to Taesung Institute...</span></p><p><span style="">It was likely that Tae-hyuk had turned Go Ah-tae into the Clown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the same time, the possibility existed that he just became the Clown earlier than expected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter what it was, the worst result happened..</span></p><p><span style="">As a result, the Clown kidnapped Seo Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn, I changed history...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, he was going to find clues and give Kang-suk&#x2019;s hints to solve the case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t stay still now that fate had started to distort this way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t the Clown&#x2019;s purpose to continue his research?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew that the project could never succeed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So something might&#x2019;ve appeared on the news.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A few strange articles stood out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...People dressed as clowns are attacking citizens.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Something was strange.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clearly remembered that the Clown worked alone in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a scientist who lived without acknowledging his failure until the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no one who could sympathize with such madness.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thanks to acting alone, he was easily caught by the police despite his great abilities.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But how did he have subordinates now?&#xA0;</span><span style="">What created such a difference?</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he needed to understand the enemy&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">-...</span><i><span style="">A bunch of people dressed as clowns are rioting...</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shone as he heard the words from the police radio that he stole.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was planning to use Transformation, but decided to stop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to stop relying so much on the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, this much is enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He bought a baseball cap from a nearby store and covered his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was just going to watch from a distance anyway.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the appearance of a slightly bad-looking high school student.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Nobody would be suspicious.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What are those people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are they completely crazy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A group of people burst out of the department store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cracking sounds could be heard from inside the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An old man came running up to Tae-hyuk and cried out,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Student! Call the police and get out of here! Crazy people are rioting in there!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied blankly,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Crazy people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! They are dressed up like clowns! Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The clowns smashed the department store door and came out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The old man ran away as soon as he saw them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked inside and saw people who looked like security guards lying on the floor with blood coming from their heads.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuweeeoooh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Osu! Osu!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuaah! Kuaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They let out strange yells and had bloodshot eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">They would have no problems appearing as the villains of a horror movie right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk examined the clowns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their appearances were strangely familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Are they addicted to the Psychotropic Incense?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the thing that Mister Park used.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously it had burned with the institute, but how could so many people be affected by the Psychotropic Incense?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk heard the police sirens and hid himself in an alley.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be complicated if he was discovered by the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pressed himself as close to the wall as possible and started organizing the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The emergence of the Clown three years earlier... And unlike the future, he has followers. Was there some Psychotropic Incense left?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown had appeared three years earlier and also had the Psychotropic Incense as a weapon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk lightly used Spying and determined the number of clowns in the department store.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;30... No, it is over 40. Isn&#x2019;t that almost like the mafia?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The more terrifying thing was that he could use the Psychotropic Incense to increase that number.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The Clown has subordinates? This balance isn&#x2019;t right!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown was armed with future technology not available to the public, and now he had the clowns that robbed the department store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They held things like iron pipes or baseball bats.</span></p><p><span style="">The Clown couldn&#x2019;t be allowed access to another research institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What would happen if he armed his subordinates with the technology?&#xA0;</span><span style="">A power incomparable to the mafia would be born.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There would be clowns who could dissolve a steel rail or be armed with things like Machina.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Hell.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran had been kidnapped by such a terrible person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, I have to appear as Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the last time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was over if he just handled the Clown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would just his crime skills just this once.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it is the co-performance of the Clown and Phantom. Let&#x2019;s do a spectacular retirement stage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk headed for a deserted hideout.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He started to prepare to fight the Clown.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
