<p><span style=""> Chapter 159 - God of Crime #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Three days had passed by since Seo Ha-ran first went missing.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk, who wanted to find her more than anyone else, was nervously pacing around the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His motto as a detective was that he should jump in directly to solve the case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was forced to be a bystander in this case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The investigation was slow and frustrating.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn! It is too much to exclude me from the investigation!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t have the authority to overturn the decision.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was glad that a large-scale investigation was being held in regards to the disappearance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu... Although many people go missing in this country...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He never thought his family would fall victim to it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, Kang-suk had a network of people whom he could trust with the investigation.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk took out his smartphone and called someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a voice was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, Sunbae.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You worked hard. Did you find anything?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;m sorry.</span></i> <i><span style="">We searched around the place where she was last seen but...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wolsang University?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the place where Ha-ran was last seen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She left the house saying she had to go to the university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she didn&#x2019;t come back.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That...</span></i> <i><span style="">We searched so thoroughly that not even an ant could hide.</span></i> <i><span style="">But there was nothing.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-how was a seemingly unreliable man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was the most proficient investigator in this country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was one of the few colleagues who Kang-suk could trust.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the missing person was his bride just a few days before their marriage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was torture not being able to do anything.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sat down and sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho told Kang-suk in a concerned tone.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I have mobilized all of my connections to look for her.</span></i> <i><span style="">So don&#x2019;t worry too much...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just focus on Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">...Well, that&#x2019;s right.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Phantom no longer contacted them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that made the higher-ups more jumpy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, they didn&#x2019;t want Kang-suk away for too long in case Phantom contacted him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For a while, he could only support the other teams.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At any rate, let me know if there are any additional clues.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Understood.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t worry.</span></i> <i><span style="">The country&#x2019;s top agents are looking for her so we will find her soon.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I hope so. Really.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk hung up and leaned back on his seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to ask Phantom for help.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom... wouldn&#x2019;t you be able to easily solve this case?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The number of cases solved by Phantom appeared in Kang-suk&#x2019;s mind.</span></p><p><span style="">He hated to admit it, but everything was great.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The mysterious masked man, Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What if he was in a situation like this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would probably solve everything with a strange idea.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk fell deep into thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, if it was Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had an order from his superiors to stay where he was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I have to do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stood up, opened the door and left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A detective writing a report outside asked with surprise,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh! Detective Cho! Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to wait here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey! I have to eat to survive! I&#x2019;m going to talk a walk and eat a bowl of short rib soup. If I stay stuck in the corner any longer, then spider webs will cover my nose.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I understand. I will tell Inspector-nim that you went to eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk left the police station and put on sunglasses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t a lie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was going out to eat something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was just a coincidence that the direction he was heading in was the place where Seo Ha-ran was last seen.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, a coincidence.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, if something goes wrong then I can write an apology.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk smiled playfully and started his car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before he knew it, he had a similar atmosphere to Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk glared at the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">He had started investigating as soon as he realized that he was possessed by it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, his stats, such as intelligence and stamina, remained the same.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other words, his physical abilities had actually been increased.</span></p><p><span style="">It was through his own efforts, rather than the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed the notification and rose from his spot.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wished I didn&#x2019;t have to use the crime skills... Hu, dammit. Right now, I should be refraining from trying to use it as much as possible...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s current location was on the screen of his smartphone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fact that he was moving meant the police hadn&#x2019;t found any clues to Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s disappearance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was hoping that the police would find her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the opera mask and put it on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could figure out Kang-suk&#x2019;s movements without the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he activated Spying to check on his sister&#x2019;s condition.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It reduced a lot of his stamina, so he was exhausted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she was alive.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A moan emerged from his Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had only used the crime skill for one second, yet his desperate need to murder someone increased.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If this continued, then he would become the psychopathic murderer once again.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Jjak!</span></i></p><p><span style="">After slapping his cheeks, he felt his sanity returning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes, I should be able to endure this much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His theory was that the skills he learned in the early days, such as Spying and Robbery, were slow to pollute his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The place where my sister was last seen...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He turned on the map application and headed to the location he loaded in advance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a bus stop not far from the Wolsang Institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was late in the afternoon so no one was passing by.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed slowly.</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to stop using his crime skills but he needed to find his sister as quickly as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He took out a small notebook and pen, then he triggered a crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Forgery!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Blurry images appeared in front of Tae-hyuk like a broken projector.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There are definitely traces of a crime here... There was something here.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He gulped and looked at the video of the kidnapping.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was noon judging by the sun floating directly overhead.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t see the exact date because he was just watching a video.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bus arrived at the stop, a woman stepping down from the vehicle.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Ha-ran wearing a white dress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A man sitting at the bus stop got up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did they make a promise in advance to meet?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved his gaze to try and see the man&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the visibility was fixed, so Tae-hyuk could only see his back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t see his face because his cap is covering his face too deeply!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran bowed politely to the man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She seemed to know him quite well.</span></p><p><span style="">Shortly after this, Seo Ha-ran went missing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was very likely that this man was the culprit.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now, just turn a little and show me your face. Yes? Just a little... Ah, why is it suddenly on the other side?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He could only see the intense image engraved on this spot. &#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t affect it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though he knew this, he couldn&#x2019;t stop watching.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere of Seo Ha-ran and the man changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man suddenly took off his hat and Seo Ha-ran looked astonished.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the man rushed towards Seo Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-T-That bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&apos;s face filled with anger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man pulled something out from his pocket and slammed it over Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s body twisted desperately as she tried to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">This was just a recorded video.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He calmed his trembling hands and focused on seeing the opponent&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is the criminal. Yes, who are you? Look this way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and waited for the man to move.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man put Ha-ran in a suitcase and turned around with light footsteps.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">The face was deformed, like a monster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was painted over with white paint.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only the lips were a bright red that looked like blood..</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew who that person was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Clown... Why is he coming out already...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The most dangerous criminal on the blacklist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The kidnapping of Ha-ran was due to the mad scientist, the Clown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">According to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s memories of the future, the Clown didn&#x2019;t appear for three more years.</span></p><p><span style="">Then why?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">It was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was because he changed history, no, destiny, with his own hands.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heok...heook...heok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae felt like his face was being baked on a hot plate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was going to die if this continued!&#xA0;</span><span style="">He forced himself to live.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Chiiiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">His arms felt like they were frying.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kkuck... Keuok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Every time he breathed, it felt like he was on fire.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Go Ah-tae slowly looked around.</span></p><p><span style="">He was burning all over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wondered why he was in such a place.</span></p><p><span style="">The Wolsang Institute, which he directed, was in a chronic deficit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had no choice but to cooperate with another institute to complete the &#x2018;Core Drive&#x2019; that he named himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the Taesung Institute of Physics and Chemistry that had the greatest wealth in the country.</span></p><p><span style="">Director Jang Ik-sam welcomed Go Ah-tae and said he would help with his research.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Both of them were rivals from the same university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One specialized in chemistry while the other specialized in physics.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their area of specialty was different, but their enthusiasm for research was unmatched by anyone else.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the two institutes joined together to proceed with the research project.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Today, he came to support the project at the Taesung institute, but the atmosphere was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Jang Ik-sam took Go Ah-tae down to the basement where there was a strange scent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he recovered his spirit, he was here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a computer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae took the computer hard disk from the half burned Jang Ik-sam and left the institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to survive because he had fainted in a secret space in a corner of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K-Kiik! W-What? E-Everybody is dead. Kikikik...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Why did laughter keep on bursting out?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was something broken due to the impact of the accident?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Or maybe it was because Jang Ik-sam accidentally had him swallow the Psychotropic Incense.</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae was clearly broken.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He walked back to his research laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hihihit! First of all, I need to check what is on the hard disk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a few locks but he could easily solve it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hard disk contained information about the Psychotropic Incense and Mister Park&#x2019;s plot to use it to turn humans into puppets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t resist laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kikikiki! These people were doing something very interesting! It would&#x2019;ve been more fun if they told me sooner!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae realized that his body&#x2019;s status was unusual and that he was close to dying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He entered the cell regenerator that was being studied in the next building. He didn&#x2019;t know the side effects, but he needed to survive first.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hihit! Yihihihihi!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If this failed, then he would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the laughter didn&#x2019;t stop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hehehehehehet!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He entered the cell regenerator that looked like a big aquarium tank.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he pressed the button.</span></p><p><span style="">One day passed by.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His burnt and charred skin regenerated to some extent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kikikiki! I fortunately lived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t do anything about the burns that distorted his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was too ugly to leave like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He recalled that he still had the tools used to dress as a clown for a Halloween party last year in the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used makeup to cover his face to a certain extent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe somebody blew up the Taesung institute to get rid of the Psychotropic Incense, but I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae laughed with his distorted face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know how to make it. Yihihihihihit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he went to the institute, he saw his people working hard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Director-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This appearance...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae sprinkled a few bottles of the Psychotropic Incense that he took from the Taesung Institute in here.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Chiiiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">This would make the researchers his faithful slaves who would cut their own necks if he asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Director G-Go Ah-tae... W-What are you...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What was with this person? The Psychotropic Incense didn&#x2019;t work on him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe he had an unusual constitution.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was one researcher who didn&#x2019;t fall slave to the Psychotropic Incense.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to dispose of defective products. Yihihihit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae walked over to the researcher with an axe he found from somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he smiled brightly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go Ah-tae. I am the Clown.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;C-Clown...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He slammed the axe down on the other person&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Hwaaaaack!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Blood splattered the white coat that he was wearing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yihihihit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Go Ah-tae...&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, the Clown laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he muttered in a low voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what should I do now?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
