<p><span style="">Chapter 42: The Hippo Hunt #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style=""> &quot;T-thank you...&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jung Yuri accepted Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s leather jacket and started to put it on.&#xA0;</span>She wasn&#x2019;t wearing any clothes besides the jacket she had just put on.</p><p><span style=""> In the end, she wasn&#x2019;t even wearing any underwear.&#xA0;</span>She was quite tall for a woman so even with a jacket, parts of her body were still exposed. If she didn&#x2019;t pull her clothes down with her hand, then her butt would be seen.</p><p><span style=""> However, her upper body was more serious.&#xA0;</span>Her chest was big enough to cause every man to take a second look. Thus, the buttons on the jacket could only be done up partway.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Hah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> A moan escaped from Jung Yuri&#x2019;s pale white lips.&#xA0;</span>She hugged herself to warm up her body even a little bit.</p><p><span style=""> She looked so pathetic that Tae-hyuk felt strangely dizzy for a moment.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk stretched his hand out to Yuri and said.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. I&#x2019;m not trying to touch your chest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Uh... yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk exercised tremendous self-control as he turned his gaze away from the chest that was visible through the leather jacket.</span></p><p><span style=""> When he touched Yuri&#x2019;s forehead, he could feel that it was as cold as ice.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Haang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Yuri shrieked as Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hand touched her forehead; however, she didn&#x2019;t resist.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Cold... Still, there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be any risk to her life. Once her body warms up...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Severe hypothermia was a risk.&#xA0;</span>The muscles of her body would be stiff and she would feel extreme fatigue.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Wipe the water from your body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Haang... Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk looked around, but he couldn&#x2019;t find anything resembling a towel.&#xA0;</span>In the end, he had to take off his t-shirt so that Yuri could have something to wipe her body down with.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Hum hum. I do laundry everyday so it shouldn&#x2019;t smell of sweat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... No. It seems good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk looked at Yuri&apos;s complexion.</span></p><p><span style=""> A red glow was starting to appear on the previously white face.&#xA0;</span>Her body temperature was rising, but it was still dangerous.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Can you get on my back? If we go to a concession stand, then there will be a heater. You can warm up there. </span></p><p><span style=""> Yuri nodded.</span></p><p><span style=""> Her lips were blue and her whole body was shaking.&#xA0;</span>Occasional moans couldn&#x2019;t help emerging from her mouth. The first thing to do was to take her to a safe place, since her legs didn&#x2019;t work.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk knelt down in a good posture.&#xA0;</span>Yuri couldn&#x2019;t support her body properly and fell on his back. Tae-hyuk e felt a heavy weight...</p><p><i><span style="">Mulkeong!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Heok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> There was something as soft as a marshmallow touching Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s back.&#xA0;</span>Yuri relaxed her grip on the leather jacket and clung onto Tae-hyuk. In the end, her breasts were touching Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s back.</p><p><span style=""> &apos;C-Cold... But very soft... N-no! Wake up Seo Tae-hyuk!&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Haaang...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s back was very warm, so a pleasant moan emerged from Yuri&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span>She was naked on the back of a man who she didn&#x2019;t know well. She would&#x2019;ve been terribly embarrassed if she was in her normal mental state.</p><p><span style=""> However, was it due to the sense of relief from her survival?&#xA0;</span>Jung Yuri couldn&#x2019;t feel any shame. It was comfortable, as if she was on her father&#x2019;s back.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk was more embarrassed about being hugged from behind than Jung Yuri was embarrassed form being on his back.&#xA0;</span>Her legs didn&#x2019;t move, so he carefully held her thighs with both hands. The soft texture was conveyed directly. Strangely, she smelled good.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;I-I don&#x2019;t know who is doing a service for whom!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jung Yuri was 170 cm tall, a height that was similar to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span>It was harder than he thought to lift up Yuri.</p><p><span style=""> &apos;But what if I use the Violence skill? I can do it with my stamina!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk used the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span>Both hands were holding Jung Yuri&#x2019;s thighs, so he had to put the iron pipe in his mouth.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk and Yuri headed to a concession stand.&#xA0;</span>He had to stop once in awhile due to the sound of Yuri&#x2019;s breathing getting too close. Then he had to calm something excited down.</p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am a man. A man who is made for this job!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho hummed as he walked around the performance venue.&#xA0;</span>Kang-suk was looking at the aquarium, while Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s task was to check this place. There was no one on the stage and in the audience seats.&#xA0;The only place left was the performer&#x2019;s waiting room.&#xA0;There was a bathtub where animals such as seals and penguins could be washed. If he were the Hippo, then he would commit the crime there.</p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho was holding a handgun.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I just picked up a gas gun. It isn&#x2019;t real like Sunbae&#x2019;s. Still, isn&#x2019;t it better than nothing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho majored in criminology and psychology and became a profiler. However, in order to serve as an investigator, he completed two years of basic education at the police academy.&#xA0;</span>He knew the perfect method to hold a gun. Furthermore, unlike his frail appearance, he was a master of judo.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Bang bang! Haha! Isn&#x2019;t this good?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho aimed towards an imaginary criminal.&#xA0;</span>He didn&#x2019;t seem like a genius investigator at this moment.</p><p><span style=""> Hyun-ho released his finger from the trigger and spun the gas gun around.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That&#x2019;s enough playing. Then let&#x2019;s start searching in earnest!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> He walked towards the place where the Hippo was hiding with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span>As he arrived at the back of the performance venue, a door with STAFF ONLY appeared.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Here.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Hyun-ho looked at the door with a serious expression and kicked it open with his foot.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> The closed door opened with a loud sound.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hands up! If you move then I will shoot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Hyun-ho knelt down and aimed the gun forward. Then he looked around.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Sheesh. There is no one here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The room only contained a large fish tank, rope and buckets.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Uh, wait a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Hyun-ho put the gun away and approached.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Here... Someone was clearly just here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> There wasn&#x2019;t anyone here. However, the evidence still remained.&#xA0;</span>The fish tank was half filled with water. He checked it by hand and the water was ice cold.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s think like Archimedes. The tank is half full. This means there was something in the water. Roughly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Hyun-ho calculated the volume of the tank and the amount that it was empty.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;.... It sound be one person who weighs around 50 kg.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> There was a lot of water on the floor.&#xA0;</span>It meant that someone had pulled out another person from the fish tank.</p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho looked around.</span></p><p><span style=""> There were rope and several buckets filled with liquid.&#xA0;</span>Hyun-ho checked the contents of the bucket.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Milk, soy sauce and cooking oil...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> There was only a one metre long tube near the fish tank.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I should be glad since my reasoning is correct. It is amazing, even if the culprit is gone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Hyun-ho touched the surface of the fish tank. &#xA0;</span><span style="">Water was splattered from someone leaving the fish tank.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;This means the person was in here until recently.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The surface of the fish tank was smooth.&#xA0;</span>Even if the water splashed, it would flow down to the ground after 10 minutes.</p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-ho swallowed his saliva.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... This is the Hippo&#x2019;s workshop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> And the Hippo was gone.&#xA0;</span>His victim was inside the fish tank.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Has he killed her already?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> It couldn&#x2019;t be. The liquids used for the murder were still inside the buckets.</span></p><p><span style=""> This meant...</span></p><p><span style=""> Joo Hyun-hos face turned white.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... Sunbae is in danger!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk stood in the dark aquarium.&#xA0;</span>Whether it was from tiredness due to the continuous overtime, Kang-suk&#x2019;s face was stiff, as if he were a wax doll.</p><p><span style=""> Then someone approached him.&#xA0;</span>Cho Kang-suk felt it and turned around quickly.&#xA0;It was someone that Cho Kang-suk knew.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ah. Kim Jong-wook? Have you come to catch the hippo?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kim Jong-wook was a police officer working in the jurisdiction.&#xA0;</span>Whenever a murder took place in the area, he was a cop who would take turns guarding the crime scene. Kim Jong-wook was responsible for the bathroom where the hippo committed his second murder. The location wasn&#x2019;t far from here. It seemed he rushed here after hearing the request for reinforcements.</p><p><span style=""> Jong-wook yelled with a pleasantly surprised face.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ah Detective Cho Kang-suk! What&#x2019;s going on here? The hippo...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk replied.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I received a tip that the hippo was here so I came to check. It&#x2019;s been a bust so far, as there&#x2019;s nobody here. Ah, I need to catch the hippo as quickly as possible. This whole day seems to be all a waste.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk&#x2019;s face was covered with a dark shadow.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Haha, indeed. I ran here after suddenly receiving an order.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Kim Jong-wook should take a break.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Haha! Isn&#x2019;t this our job?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk stared at Kim Jong-wook with a blank expression.</span></p><p><span style=""> He was dressed in civilian clothes.&#xA0;</span>He had one hand in his pocket, and his pants were all wet.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Was it raining outside? Your clothes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jong-wook gave a deep sigh.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Aigoo. It just suddenly rained. Did you bring an umbrella?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I didn&apos;t bring one. When I leave then I&#x2019;ll just use a newspaper. I&#x2019;d like to call a taxi, but I can&#x2019;t. You should know. The salary of a detective is poor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;It seems so. You must have suffered.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Anyway, I think that the tip is likely to be a joke. Then, I will look around the performance venue. Do you want to come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jong-wook nodded.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;That seems best. By the way, are you alone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk paused for a moment before asking in surprise.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Why do you ask?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jong-wook slowly approached Kang-suk and laughed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The two of them were now close enough to touch if he stretched out his hand.&#xA0;</span>Jong-wook&#x2019;s mouth twisted oddly.&#xA0;There was a sharp knife in his hand.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;I need to know how many people I have to kill!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jong-wook stepped forward and plunged the knife into Kang-suk&#x2019;s chest.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Puok!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk screamed. </span></p><p><span style=""> The attack was so unexpected that there was no resistance at all.&#xA0;</span>He instantly fell down.</p><p><span style=""> Jong-wook giggled like he was enjoying the scene and said,</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ohuhu... I wonder how you knew I was here. Will you listen to me before dying? Huh? Detective Cho Kang-suk. Please say something. Uhahahaha! That&apos;s correct. I am the Hippo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Jong-wook... No, the hippo grinned brutally as he twisted the knife stuck in Kang-suk&#x2019;s chest.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
