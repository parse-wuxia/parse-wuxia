<p><span style=""> Chapter 156 - End of the Revenge #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, Machina&#x2019;s maneuvering limit is around two hours.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, Tae-hyuk had the Machina replacing both of his arms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since upgrading to &#x2018;King&#x2019;, his &#x2018;Illegal Surgery&#x2019; skill had evolved into &#x2018;Body Modification&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was like a converted human who appeared in the movies.</span></p><p><span style="">Machina was a machine.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It took a lot of training to move it properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk forced it using Body Modification.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just using it in simple everyday life was a burden.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I used it to smash a wall and to block bullets, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be strange if the Machina broke down right now.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The stamina that had risen after becoming a King was barely hanging on.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk massaged his arms and looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror, which marked the location of the remaining survivors in the underground research institute.</span></p><p><span style="">After two hours of fighting, the number of Yakuza members remaining was less than half.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The survivors lost their will to fight and started to protest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to take control of them, he would receive some damage, even with the help of the crime skills and Machina.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why the power of the Bomber was necessary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible to blow up an institute of this size with just one or two bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, seven bombs were installed at the optimal points and would explode at the same time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All the preparations were finished, and he could now blow up the place at any time by pressing the switch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First of all, I have to wait for the Bomber&#x2019;s revenge to end and then the institute...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk noticed something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...Eh? What the?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">This was an underground research facility.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally a ventilation system was installed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, a light pink smoke was emerging from it.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wasn&#x2019;t the only one to notice this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A place not far from where Tae-hyuk was located.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Yakuza were doing their best to build a base in the laboratory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of them looked at the smoke being emitted from the vents and shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-The Psychotropic Incense?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Surely they aren&#x2019;t sacrificing us...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Damn! Mister Park has left us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack! N-no! This can&#x2019;t...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even those who maintained their composure started to panic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The smoke was a vivid pink.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At this level, it was almost like a raw solution.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The smoke that was diluted a hundred times could turn people into puppets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this concentration...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;L-Let me out of here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza felt like prisoners of war who were trapped in a gas chamber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Psychotropic Incense instantly spread to cover the Yakuza.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwaaaack! U-Uwak, kuoock!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Through numerous research, its effectiveness had reached the limit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, it was mixed with alcohol and the fragrant scent spread in the air.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what if it was sent through the ventilation system?</span></p><p><span style="">The undiluted solution was sprayed.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t poisonous, so it didn&#x2019;t kill the Yakuza.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kkuck...! Keeok....kuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But at this moment, the Psychotropic Incense showed an unexpected effect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Grr... Grrrrrrr!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The eyes of a Yakuza member affected by the Psychotropic Incense turned red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The muscles of his body relaxed and blood vessels bulged out on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuaah! Aaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza member started to attack his colleague.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He reached out for the neck of the person next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kkuck. Kkuk! Keuok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His mouth started foaming.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From the eyes, blood mixed with water started to flow down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Some people were scratching their necks and vomiting up blood.</span></p><p><span style="">Those who inhaled the Psychotropic Incense were no longer human.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All reasoning disappeared and they became monsters that wanted to kill.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned as he watched the scene unfolding before him.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Once all reason is taken away from the Yakuza, only violence remains.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The area around him was filled with the smoke of the Psychotropic Incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite his stats reducing by half, he managed to retain his sanity.</span></p><p><span style="">However, his stats were still falling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The moment it reached zero, he would lose control.</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror let out a warning sound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would become dangerous if he didn&#x2019;t get out of here right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought that the Psychotropic Incense just turned humans into puppets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But something this ridiculous was happening.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In the end, the Psychotropic Incense is similar to dynamite.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Sometimes, inventions made in goodwill were distorted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Dynamite was made for mines to work safely in the mines.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the dynamite became bombs that killed many people.</span></p><p><span style="">The Psychotropic Incense was created to steer people to buy the company&#x2019;s products.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It gave birth to a larger evil.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The virus that they were studying here could propagate infinitely.</span></p><p><span style="">From what Tae-hyuk remembered, it had never appeared in the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...I know as far as 14 years in the future. Then after that...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If that were to happen, the world would fall into chaos.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe even World War Three would happen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had a bomb switch that could blow this whole place up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Psychotropic Incense was a perfume.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he set it on fire before it was absorbed in the body, he could burn it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This meant that he could get rid of everything simply by pressing the switch.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s forehead was sweaty as he thought about it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe he was doing something great without knowing it.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Let&#x2019;s get out of here first and wait for the Bomber to contact me. However, that situation...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe the Bomber was in a crisis.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I prepared &#x2018;that&#x2019; for such a situation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled wickedly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he wouldn&#x2019;t care even if the world was destroyed.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s body moved at lightning speed.</span></p><p><span style="">People said that if there was a crisis, a human could exert the power of Superman.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At this moment, he surely transcended human movements.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bujik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A rough groan emerged from Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His body blocked the door of the shelter that was attempting to close.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung lost all sensation in his lower body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His spine was crushed by the shock.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, his mind was clear.</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Jang Ik-sam shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you doing? You blocked it with your body? Are you that eager to die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...J-Jang Ik-sam.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A fierce look was in Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s eyes as he glared at Jang Ik-sam.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park was shocked as he watched from behind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t something any sane person could do.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung spat out blood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he still managed to grab a bomb in his hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were seven points from A to G where he had to install the bombs, but there had been eight bombs in his bag.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T...th...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What was he trying to say?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung had blood flowing from his mouth and couldn&#x2019;t speak properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, his hand installed the bomb on the glass.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park realized what he was trying to do and moved swiftly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he couldn&#x2019;t stop the Bomber then he would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to stop it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing? Shoot! Shoot him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, yes!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The bodyguards, who had been staring blankly, aimed their guns.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dududu!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Dozens of bullets were fired.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Wasn&#x2019;t this place bulletproof?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park wanted to shout.</span></p><p><span style="">Jang Ik-sam howled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K-Kim Tae-sung. I made a mistake. S-So please, my life... I-I will also give you money... How about one billion won?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoh, eooh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung would lose his life in a few minutes after suffering a fatal injury, so what good was offering him money?&#xA0;</span><span style="">But Jang Ik-sam was so confused that he couldn&#x2019;t even think.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He put his head to the ground.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i> <i><span style="">Kung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please spare me! I was wrong! Y-Yes. It was all Mister Park. I didn&#x2019;t want to kill your family. So...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But Kim Tae-sung already couldn&#x2019;t hear anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He just stared at Jang Ik-sam beyond the glass and looked at the bomb that he just installed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had made it several times stronger than the other seven bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It could tear apart the glass and blow up the shelter.</span></p><p><span style="">Had Phantom expected that something like this would happen?&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, that wasn&#x2019;t important right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The life of that person in front of him...</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Honey...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sang-ah...</span></p><p><span style="">From now on, he would be going to the place where they were waiting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could smile and go.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jang Ik-sam threw himself back as Kim Tae-sung pressed the bomb switch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the tempered glass didn&#x2019;t do anything.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was a huge explosion that burst the eardrums.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Inside the shelter were Jang Ik-sam, Mister Park, and Yakuza members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything including the Psychotropic Incense started to burn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the last moment, Kim Tae-sung smirked and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes, I am the Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He himself became the bomb that scorched his enemies.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">F-Father!</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes?</span></i> <i><span style="">Sang-ah?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Even if this is a picnic, why are you sleeping on the bench?</span></i> <i><span style="">You have been in the research institute for several months, so this chance to play...</span></i> <i><span style="">It will be wasted if you are sleeping.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Oh, I fell asleep while waiting for my beautiful daughter.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Eh?</span></i> <i><span style="">Is Daddy crying?</span></i> <i><span style="">Did you have a strange dream?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Haha...</span></i> <i><span style="">It was a dream, a dream.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hihi.</span></i> <i><span style="">I made sushi and sandwiches for you.</span></i> <i><span style="">Mother will be angry so let&#x2019;s go quickly.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Oh, she is scary when angry.</span></i> <i><span style="">Let&#x2019;s go quickly.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes!</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Once we finish eating, do you want to go on the rides at the amusement park?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wahh!</span></i> <i><span style="">Daddy!</span></i> <i><span style="">Hooray!</span></i> <i><span style="">Can I go on the Blue Dragon Train?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Of course.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then hurry.</span></i> <i><span style="">Mommy will be waiting.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes?</span></i> <i><span style="">Okay!</span></i> <i><span style="">Mommy will wait forever for Daddy!</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Really?</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Ah, I see.</span></i> <i><span style="">How lucky.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">But it is okay now Honey.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">You don&#x2019;t have to wait anymore.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">I&#x2019;m going right now.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;.</span></p><p>....</p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuuong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">He felt a tremendous vibration from his feet like there was an earthquake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew what it meant.</span></p><p><span style="">He had the switch for the seven bombs installed in the institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung only had the switch for one bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Your revenge was successful, Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He tried to get in contact with the radio, just in case. However, only empty noise was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk left the research institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he exited, there was a black van hiding behind a wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had prepared it for the escape.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will wait one more minute as promised.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">60...</span></p><p><span style="">59...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk closed his eyes and counted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter if Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s revenge succeeded or not.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In one minute, he would blow up the entire laboratory by pressing his switch.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Psychotropic Incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Virus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would all disappear into flames.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It was really long.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The persistent relationship from his previous life was finally ending.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...1.
