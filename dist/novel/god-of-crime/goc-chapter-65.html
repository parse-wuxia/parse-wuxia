<p>Chapter 65 - Bomber #3</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik was troubled after receiving the call from the unidentified person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The commissioner of the National Police Agency had given him field authority, but the case had grown too big to make a judgement alone.</span></p><p><span style="">The SWAT team members also didn&#x2019;t look good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their abilities were lacking and they needed to get help from an unknown person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The SWAT team leader said with a resolute expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, why don&#x2019;t we try to do as much as we can? Then we can ask for cooperation if we need it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, this time they had half a day to spare.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First, they had to wait for Joo Hyun-ho to arrive.</span></p><p><span style="">Shortly afterwards, a BMW arrived at the scene of the incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a luxury car that wasn&#x2019;t suitable for the field, but it was a ride that was bought using his own money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. I&#x2019;m sorry for the delay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, it was faster than I thought. Just listen to the tape recorder.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;ll solve the riddle right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Numerous people paid attention as Joo Hyun-ho listened to the hint that the Bomber left behind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the one who solved the first problem instantly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They thought he could do it again this time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they could solve this case without the help of the God of Crime.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik thought so as he looked at Joo Hyun-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it? Will it take more time? The time for the bomb to go of is still five hours away. Relax.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho made a difficult expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t that he couldn&#x2019;t solve the problem, it was just not the answer that he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s expression became serious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like Joo Hyun-ho was unable to say the answer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is being a petty jerk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. That&#x2019;s exactly what it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho sighed and wrote down the answer to the problem on the piece of paper.</span></p><p><span style="">[Educational institutions in Seoul.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;That is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scope was too broad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, if the bomb went off then the damage to young students would be enormous.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho bit his lip and answered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The answer I got is an educational institute. More details are needed but it just leads to an endless loop. The problem itself is literally a trap.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh my god...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho was a Mensa member and the owner of a very high IQ.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His reasoning was top class among the investigators.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That Joo Hyun-ho was saying this.</span></p><p><span style="">He was very nervous about the content.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, a bomb is hidden in one of the many educational institutes in Seoul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This hint can&#x2019;t be narrowed down further.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you sure?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. King Solomon would say the same thing if he were to be resurrected.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Investigator Joo. Do you know how many educational institutions there are in Seoul?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Three years ago, there were a total of 872 kindergartens, 594 elementary schools, 379 middle schools, 317 high schools, 29 special schools and 17 others for a total of 2208. I think we will need at least 20,000 people to search all of them for the bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;20,000...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an impossible number.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even if all the police officers in Seoul were gathered together, it is impossible. In the end, you will need to obtain the cooperation of the private sector. So the presence of the bomb will spread to the mass media.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh... That can&#x2019;t happen!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bombs occurring in the middle of the city.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it spread to the media then there would be a huge uproar, and the censure would be tremendous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Do-shik was prepared to take off all his clothes and take responsibility if this case went wrong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know it was a situation where he would have to go to the army rather than ending it with the police.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kim Do-shik made a firm decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be helped. No matter how big it gets, the safety of the public is the top priority I will take responsibility. Immediately contact all educational institutions in downtown Seoul and ask them to search for bombs on campus. I also have to make a call to the commissioner. I will do it on my line.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik picked up his phone to call the commissioner of the NPA.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the same time, someone called him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he picked up the call, the person he expected was on the other line.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It looks like you are asking for help from the police commissioner.</span></i> <i><span style="">As expected of Inspector Kim Do-shik.</span></i> <i><span style="">You will accept full responsibility to protect the people.</span></i> <i><span style="">But I am sorry.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;...What does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have time to think about this person.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I have already found the bomb.</span></i> <i><span style="">Why don&#x2019;t you go to H High School in K district?</span></i> <i><span style="">Ah right, this is a service.</span></i> <i><span style="">It isn&#x2019;t easy to mobilize 20,000 people.</span></i> <i><span style="">The choice is yours to make.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Then the call cut out.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t sure what the other person knew, but if his information was true, then he would get 150 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they would be able to handle the remaining bombs.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho. Do you want to go to K High School to check if there is really a bomb?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He would soon see if the other person was a fraud or not.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Bomber or that bastard. I don&#x2019;t know who is worse. The person doing it, or the one trying to make money from it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik suddenly wanted to smoke a cigarette.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There really was a bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moaned as he finished the phone call and sat on a bench.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He seemed to have overdone it this time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been running hard for almost three hours, and now he was completely exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyways, the one coming to check the bomb is probably Kang-suk hyung. Shouldn&#x2019;t I finish the preparations before that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Just finding the bomb ahead of the police wasn&#x2019;t enough.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also had to do a lot of work behind the scenes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, Ha-yang noona is very useful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk found it hard to imagine her as security company employee.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was with her help that he could call Kim Do-shik with such confidence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She manipulated the origin of the call every time Tae-hyuk called.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like putting a swan in water - on the surface, they floated gracefully. However, their feet were actually moving rapidly in the water.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My agility has increased, thanks to running around so much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In Atlantis, he had to go beyond the limits of his flesh to escape, so his agility had gone up by five.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now when he checked, it had risen by another three.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m already at 33.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he thought about it, his agility stat mainly rose when he was with Yoo Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe Yoo Ha-yang had something special like An Eun-young&#x2019;s studying skill?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Next time I have to find out more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That wasn&#x2019;t all that was available.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was necessary to check everything as the God of Crime.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was sitting on a bench in the corner of the playground at H High School, near the school where he caught the voyeur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to blend in naturally because he had the uniform.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now. I will finish this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a large courier box at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s feet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s liquid bomb was hidden inside it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the primer was triggered, the two liquids would mix and cause an explosion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had removed the primer.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Originally, 20,000 people were mobilized because of this bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The information spread to the media and caused an uproar around the whole country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was exactly what the Bomber wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">Distract the police and kill his real target.</span></p><p><span style="">Why did he become the Bomber when he was an ordinary chemistry teacher?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was clear that Yoo Ha-yang was interested in this.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s thoughts were different.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A bad guy is just bad. All the people I met in prison were heinous criminals.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All criminals had their circumstances, but it was no excuse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk had a memorable stay in prison for 10 years, and had met countless criminals there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, Tae-hyuk believed that criminals were just criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are just a good money source.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and looked at the box containing the bomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the police discovered this, they would have to deal with him.</span></p><p><span style="">He had received a bounty for catching Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t earn that much despite catching some criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally a free service.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no enthusiasm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to catch a criminal who didn&#x2019;t have a bounty.</span></p><p><span style="">But the police would eventually given Tae-hyuk 150 million to catch the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A criminal who caught other criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Today, the God of Crime appeared in the world for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are still more than 100 people on the blacklist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Some of them couldn&#x2019;t be judged by the law such as Park Seong-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Some people he couldn&#x2019;t turn over to the police, like Big Mama and Moonlight Flower.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were at least 50 people he could catch with their own crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Depending on the risk, the bounty applied would be between 50 million to 200 million.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he could get them all, then he could receive over five billion won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With that type of money, his family wouldn&#x2019;t need to worry for a lifetime.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, we can buy a good apartment. Noona can open a small shop. Would Tae-min like an office?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was starting now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Until now, he had dealt with the criminals without thinking, but now it was different.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was important to pursue Park Jung-hwan&#x2019;s whereabouts, but he needed money for the happy future of his family.</span></p><p><span style="">It was very deep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The blacklist would make him big money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to act while concealing his identity, he thought of the title, the God of Crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shall I finish this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he checked the time, Kang-suk would be coming soon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the bomb box on the bench and hung a banner from the tree.</span></p><p><span style="">The bomb wouldn&#x2019;t be difficult to find.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When they looked at this, the police would cry out the name of the God of Crime, rather than the Bomber.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t look back and moved to find the next bomb.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keok... This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could find the bomb at H High School.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other person clearly said that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been wondering what it meant, but the person did something cute like this..</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha... He is called the God of Crime? I don&#x2019;t know who you are but you are a delightful person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The SWAT team leader muttered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A box containing the bomb was placed in a corner of the school.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was a large banner above it.</span></p><p><span style="">[Feel free to eat - God of Crime.]</span></p><p><span style="">There were three boxes containing ramyun noodles underneath.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Inspector. I think he brought this for us to eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck. Then he should have given us hot water as well!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, the school gave the police warm water and they could eat warm noodles.</span></p><p><span style="">In the meantime, Kim Do-shik finished his conversation with the commissioner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He delivered the contents directly to Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have permission. I will appoint Detective Cho as the head of the Special Headquarters for the God of Crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the future, I will tell him to speak to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik handed his phone to Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the typical boss dumping the unenviable task onto his subordinate.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk made a dumbfounded expression at the promotion.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik added,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A special budget will be organized.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik spoke angrily with a red face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Deal with the God of Crime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t decide if this was right or not.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know if this is really good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But with his help, nobody will get hurt and we can catch the Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, the opponent is a criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. A criminal who catches other criminals.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was left holding the phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the future, it was his task to deal with the God of Crime.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
