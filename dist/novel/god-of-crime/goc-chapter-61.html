<p><span style="">Chapter 61: It seems like something is going on #3 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The affinity points could only be obtained from people related to the blacklist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other words, he wouldn&#x2019;t get anything if he saved people not related to the blacklist.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had smashed the Death Circus and saved the lives of hundreds of people, but had only gotten 20 affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other words, those 20 points represented the number of victims Choi Sung-yeol and Kim Joon-young would&#x2019;ve killed in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&#x2019;t kill the participants directly; they only crafted extreme situations to make people kill each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the victims died at the hands of other participants, which why he didn&#x2019;t get as much as he hoped after saving a lot of people.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this time he was sure.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The culprit was an IED, a mass killer on the rampage with bombs.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clearly remembered from the blacklist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he saved the victims of this case then he could gain a lot of affinity points.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk remembered everything he could about the disaster at Atlantis.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to guess the situation to a certain extent because it had been blasted on the news every day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The water in the tanks completely filled up the third underground floor and slowly overflowed, eventually reaching the fourth floor.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, it was just recently opened so most of the audience was gathered on the first and second basement floors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the capacity of the tanks was slightly larger, than the damage would have been several times greater.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were perhaps around 30~40 people here, and he had to get them out as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But it wasn&#x2019;t as easy as he thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk found someone hiding in the dining room and tried to persuade him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Staying here is dangerous! I know a way out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was definitely an announcement to stay where I am!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Damn...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">Someone had broadcasted a message that a small problem had occurred and that they were trying to recognize what it was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, don&#x2019;t move and remain at your current position.</span></p><p><span style="">The one who made the announcement was probably Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It turned out like this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">When a person received conflicting information, they would always choose the more reliable one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The announcement was more reliable than someone who looked like a gangster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to save anyone here if they didn&#x2019;t believe him.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang was probably suffering for the same reason.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I need to confront authority with authority.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk headed to the broadcasting room in a corner of the 4B floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The door lock was firmly locked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I have a key to open any lock.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed his iron pipe with both hands and swung it using all his strength.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Iron hit iron and sparks emerged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to confirm that the lock had loosened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um. How about one more time? Well, I will keep going until it works!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took advantage of his centrifugal force to open it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The attack that burst out had great destructive power, thanks to the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In less than 10 seconds, the iron lock was shattered and Tae-hyuk was able to enter the broadcasting room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an unauthorized intrusion, but Tae-hyuk wasn&#x2019;t going to worry about such things.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it enough if they don&#x2019;t notice?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk entered the room and looked around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is simple.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were several chairs and machinery for broadcasting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk could make an announcement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But then he saw a strange device installed on the machine, a recorder connected to a clock that was attached to the timer switch of the broadcast device.</span></p><p><span style="">That only meant one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quickly realized what it was supposed to do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the identity of the person who made the announcement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. Who installed this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk separated the recorder from the machine and pressed the power button.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a voice was heard, mixed with some noises.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This is the management.</span></i> <i><span style="">The park is currently experiencing a small trouble and we are investigating the cause of it.</span></i> <i><span style="">Although it is somewhat noisy now, please wait where you are.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The timer showed that it was broadcast exactly six minutes ago.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, people died because of this broadcast without even knowing it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t like it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was only one way to counter this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror at lightning speed to activate Voice Modulation.</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can imitate the voice of Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;That bastard Kim Tae-sung...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The identity behind the voice was Kim Tae-sung, and the timer device attached to the recorder was obviously something used for his IEDs as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, I will be releasing that firecracker soon.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were bruises on the area where he had rolled around less than one hour ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he continuously used the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All his muscles would be in hell tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the broadcasting device and turned on the power.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The practice he had in speaking would be useful.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed a few times to check that the voice was correct before speaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the management. It has been confirmed that the cause of the disturbance is damage to the water tanks. All of the fourth floor will likely be submerged within 20 minutes. Please gather in the central plaza and evacuate in the manner provided by the guide.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned off the microphone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he no longer needed to argue with people to save them.</span></p><p><span style="">He checked the time and there were four minutes remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How many people could he save?</span></p><p><span style="">He would go to the places that he thought would have people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could probably save seven or eight people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only thing left was to see how many Yoo Ha-yang could secure.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, let&apos;s get another rise in agility today...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started running again beyond his limits.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Tae-hyuk headed to the central plaza with nine people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Those who listened to the broadcast followed Tae-hyuk obediently.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus he could gather more people than he previously thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang just needed to rescue one person for him to gain enough affinity points to have his plan succeed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it almost time?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Without realizing it, the water was up to his thighs.</span></p><p><span style="">Nevertheless, there were still people waiting for the next instructions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The water would gradually rise until they could no longer move.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most people were gathered in the same space so he could rescue nine people in four minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">No one sensed any danger as they followed him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everyone else was quiet so they should do so as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there was the broadcast.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if it seemed a little dangerous, everything would be fine; it was that type of crowd psychology.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung used the bomb to exploit that.</span></p><p><span style="">A sound emerged from Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth as soon as he got to the central plaza.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;1-17?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang brought almost twice his number.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk cut through the people and said to Yoo Ha-yang.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. How did you collect so many people in four minutes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? It wasn&#x2019;t four minutes. It was 10 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So... People followed you before the broadcast?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang was baffled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, that broadcast was Tae-hyuk? But people just followed me because they wanted to go with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized that the vast majority of people here were men.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s looks were pretty enough for her to become a celebrity right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was natural for men to not refuse to go with Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help laughing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he thought about it, he had been defeated by beauty.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk imitated Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s voice using Voice Modulation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he shouted towards the people gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All of you were suddenly assembled here so I don&#x2019;t think you understand the situation. However, this is a very urgent situation. Thank you for your understanding.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then a big man opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is this place really flooding?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s right. The proof is the water on the floor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sighs emerged here and there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t rescue coming?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The third underground floor is completely immersed in water. Perhaps the earliest time will be in one hour. However, we will be completely covered in water in 10 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then we are going to die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is only one way to escape. It is through the vents in the ceiling.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But if we go to the wrong place and head to the third underground floor then we can&#x2019;t go back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk paused for a moment, then continued in Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s distinctive charismatic voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, I know where the blueprints to this place is. I plan to check it for a safe route and then we will escape.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Exclamations popped out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now give me the points! Don&#x2019;t make me dizzy waiting!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Obviously he should get affinity points for the people here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He fiddled with the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he received the notification message he had been waiting for.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps it was caught in a lag.</span></p><p><span style=""><span><a id="footnoteref-26" href="#footnote-26">[26]</a></span></span></p><p><span style="">[You can use the affinity points to enhance crime skills or activate hidden attributes.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;T-That&apos;s great!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly cheered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Along with the one point from Oh Soo-ah, he had 27 points.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then wait a few minutes and I will bring back the blueprint.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t use Spying and Forgery with so many eyes on him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just as Tae-hyuk was about to move, a man asked sharply.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I am Yoo Tae-soo. By the way, if there is no time then why didn&#x2019;t you get the blueprint in advance?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled lightly as he replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A few minutes is enough. I don&#x2019;t think there will be any problems.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am just wondering if we can all escape within the time limit. If you made a mistake by not getting the blueprint in advance, will you be responsible if someone else dies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo felt like an enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If that situation comes up then I will be the last one to leave. So are there any problems?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo closed his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hurriedly moved to a place where he could avoid their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">He first invested 10 affinity points into buying the new attribute for the Spying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among the items, he selected the &#x2018;Extend Range&#x2019; one and there was the sound effect of success.</span></p><p><span style="">[A new attribute has been given to the Spying skill.]</span></p><p><span style="">-The area that can be detected has increased.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he had 17 points remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk boldly used 15 points to strengthen the Forgery skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Rapid Production.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an attribute that increased his production speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&#x2019;t the salary of a worker... By affinity points fell to two in an instant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Both of them boasted a tremendous performance so they cost a lot of points.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, Spying!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror and activated Spying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that time, it felt like pain like a hot iron was poking him in every nerve.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuaah... Oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hurriedly covered his mouth with both hands to block the scream that escaped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t far from the place where everyone was gathered, so he couldn&#x2019;t show them anything strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His senses expanded by hundreds of times to cover all of Atlantis.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What is this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His brain was burning from the pain!&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed as if his body couldn&#x2019;t withstand the crime skill, but he had to hang in there.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth and shoved all the information in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">9%...</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Crazy, it is only 9% done?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk watched the progress on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was 10 seconds of hell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It might be because his stats had already exceeded the limit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His eyes turned bloodshot.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I still have a step left!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Now it was time to draw the blueprint using the Forgery skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used trembling fingers to manipulate the Demon Revealing Mirror and activate Forgery.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the world was accelerating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Time flowed in milliseconds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then nanoseconds and so on...</span></p><p><span style="">As time flowed thousands of times faster, Tae-hyuk saw a hallucination where everything was broken into pieces.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two minutes felt like eternity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk puked up something black as soon as it finished.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His intestines were clearly damaged, and therefore he knew that the skill he used now wasn&#x2019;t possible with the body of a Commoner.</span></p><p><span style="">At the very least, Noble...</span></p><p><span style="">No, he had to be a King in order to use it effortlessly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had used it with a Commoner&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And it was a success.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the blueprint in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything was perfectly contained in a 841mm by 594 mm piece of paper.</span></p><p><span style="">With this, they would be able to go anywhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything needed for the escape from Atlantis was prepared.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wiped off the blood at his mouth with his sleeve and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He repeated a line of dialogue from a famous artist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is it? Simple, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><div class="footnotes"><ol><li><span id="footnote-26">affinity points have been acquired.<a href="#footnoteref-26" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li></ol></div><p></p>
