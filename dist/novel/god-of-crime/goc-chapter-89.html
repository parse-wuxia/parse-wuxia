<p><span style="">Chapter 89 - Genius and Genius #5</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god... Then everything was manipulated...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik sighed as he listened to Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s report.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never thought that a criminal organization would have planted a spy within the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like someone unseen was pointing a gun at his back.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But you are truly amazing. How did you know that Lee Shi-hyun was lying? I was also tricked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is because I am a genius.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then why are you broken by that Phantom bastard?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s words caused Joo Hyun-ho to tremble.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had a showdown with Phantom over the bombs and was fully defeated.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, isn&#x2019;t that the same for everyone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">On that day, the police had been puppets dancing on the stage prepared by Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho had been so mentally wounded by the event that he couldn&#x2019;t eat properly for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had such an optimistic personality that his childhood nickname was Beagle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to that, he recovered quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But Phantom is being surprisingly quiet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. He hasn&#x2019;t appeared after the broadcast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a possibility that he might&#x2019;ve gone overseas.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speaking of overseas... The place that Phantom blew up...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho was thinking about T Medical Centre that Phantom broke. </span><span style="">They were in business with the Chinese mafia, the Triads.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The Chinese mafia.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik raised his finger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, there was a Red Mafia crime shortly after that incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If Japan&#x2019;s Yakuza show up here, then all three forces will gather in Korea. If there is a fight against Phantom... If this continues, something huge will happen in Korea.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is our job to prevent it. I have obtained the complete cooperation from Incheon International Airport. I am worried.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, if Phantom shows back up then I will surely catch him this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha... I wish that would happen. The pressure from above to catch Phantom is no joke right now. Have you gone to take a look at the Phantom of the Opera?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm... Why? I already know it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, you are the main investigator. Aren&#x2019;t you responsible for it now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then try to profile the people working at the police station. Make up some excuse for it. Perhaps a rough psychological counseling? Normally it would cost 100,000 won, but it would be nice if you offered it for free. Come to think of it, I don&#x2019;t think you have a psychologist license.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Joo Hyun-ho stuttered out,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That is because I graduated from another course at university.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was good at profiling, but there were over 100 people working at this police station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would take 50 hours to talk with them for 30 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why, don&#x2019;t you want to do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho sighed,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;ll do it. It is true that a competent person is too busy to breathe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seems that it will be hard to go home from work on time for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, I found a trustworthy person so you just focus on the profiling.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Umm... I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik spoke confidently.</span></p><p><span style="">This time, he made sure that he selected a very competent appraiser.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, the new appraiser that Kim Do-shik selected was also a Red Mafia spy.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it really okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do looked at the opera mask that Tae-hyuk was wearing with an uneasy expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I showed you my skills.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed to the Rubens hanging on the wall of the director&#x2019;s office.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before fully embarking on the mission, he had copied the Rubens painting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he showed the final product to Kim Hyun-do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although Kim Hyun-do had no professional knowledge, he had the experience of living and working with paintings all throughout his life.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even though it is a fake, sometimes the fake can seem&#x200B; real.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do nodded quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plan was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Red Mafia would once again send a spy as the appraiser, and the painting displayed here would unconditionally become authentic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After that, the Red Mafia would release their fakes onto the market.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Those who thought they bought the genuine one would flock to compare it to the Rubens painting on display at S University&#x2019;s museum.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what Tae-hyuk was aiming for: to paint his fake on top of the Red Mafia&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, there would be very small changes to the composition of brush strokes and oil paint.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If the fake I made becomes real, then the Red Mafia&#x2019;s plan would be completely smashed.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said nothing as he looked at Kim Hyun-do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sometimes silence was more convincing than 100 words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. If you are able to thwart the Red Mafia&#x2019;s plan then I will cooperate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a satisfied expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to do that, he first had to recover the fake hanging in the museum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Guards patrolled the museum 24 hours a day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if the security device was released using Kim Hyun-do&#x2019;s master key, he had to avoid being seen.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the forgery of the Rubens painting that he had already drawn.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. You can hang that instead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is painted on drawing paper. Won&#x2019;t it be noticed when touched?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A security guard would know not to get close to the painting due to the security devices.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do nodded with a convinced expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fake that Tae-hyuk was hard to distinguish from the original without touching it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guards couldn&#x2019;t get close so it was perfect to deceive them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard about the guard&#x2019;s patrol route so I will take care of that. Then exactly seven minutes later, turn off the security system for one minute. In the meantime, I will switch the paintings.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plan progressed smoothly and he was able to obtain the fake made by the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Hyun-do opened his mouth once he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You succeeded. I&#x2019;m glad you don&#x2019;t have a bad heart. If you did, all the museums in the country would be wiped out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will start.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made his own studio in the director&#x2019;s office.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The estimated work time on the Demon Revealing Mirror was 120 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">[Forgery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Analyzing the specified artwork.</span></p><p><span style="">[A forgery of &#x2018;Descent from the Cross&#x2019;.]</span></p><p><span style="">-A craftsman with great skill has copied and painted Rubens &#x2018;Descent from the Cross.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">-The detailed information is hidden because the rating is too low.</span></p><p><span style="">-Tools needed: Pigment, colour, soluble oil...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The opponent is someone who is superior to me in forgery. Perhaps even more than Big Mama... The Russian mafia has huge monsters.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk admired the opponent&#x2019;s skills, and couldn&#x2019;t help wondering who made this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If his rating was higher then would it be possible to know that information?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, he didn&#x2019;t even know the conditions to upgrade to a &#x2018;King&#x2019;.</span></p><p><span style="">In the future, he would definitely have a confrontation with the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The criminals on the blacklist were heinous criminals, but they were mainly just individuals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the mafia was a criminal group that boasted tremendous power.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A hint to become a &#x2018;king&#x2019; might be hiding in the fight against them.</span></p><p><span style="">Once the crime skill was activated, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body started moving at a tremendous speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh god... Is that the movement of a human?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do stared at Tae-hyuk with a blank expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands moved at a tremendous speed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was no change in the painting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a great thing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was putting pigments on the painting but the place where his brush passed was still the same.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Hyun-do wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it if he wasn&#x2019;t seeing it with his own eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom... You...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After two hours, Tae-hyuk looked at his work with a satisfied expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t touch the things that the Red Mafia&#x2019;s artist used to make it look like an old masterpiece.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the color of the Phantom was coming out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was now the work of Phantom instead of the Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror popped up in front of Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Huh?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">[A great work of art has been completed.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Dexterity has increased by 1.</span></p><p><span style="">-You have exceeded the 100% limit and a new attribute is born.</span></p><p><span style="">[The Hawk Eyes attribute can be learnt.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hawk Eyes?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like something new had been added to the attributes that formerly could only be raised by affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he checked, the Spying skill was shining.</span></p><p><span style="">[Hawk Eyes]</span></p><p><span style="">-Able to see the abilities of the specified target in detail.</span></p><p><span style="">-If the other person is using a pseudonym then you can confirm their true name.</span></p><p><span style="">-Necessary affinity points required: 10 </span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Hawk Eyes attribute could increase the number of details that he saw.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he learned it, then the uses for it were endless.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Is this DLC (downloadable content)... Shouldn&#x2019;t a great ability like this be the default? By the way, I didn&#x2019;t know that Forgery would strengthen Spying. Indeed, there is truly something about the growth of the crime skills.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">His skills had been constantly growing after becoming a Noble.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Voice Modulation evolved into Disguise. Now a new Spying added. What the hell is the criteria?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Phantom stared into the air for a while, Kim Hyun-do asked in a quivering voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is it completed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It is perfect. Now I just need to put this back in the original place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it truly possible to destroy the Red Mafia&#x2019;s plan with this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Very interesting things will happen soon. Director Kim Hyun-do, you should eat popcorn while you&#x2019;re watching.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Popcorn?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After repeating what he did two hours ago, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s imitation was displayed in S University&#x2019;s museum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he watched it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This time, there is no flashy reversal or colourful explosions. That is why it is even more enjoyable. From now on, it&apos;s showtime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">A few days later, as Phantom said, another appraiser showed up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After spending one hour looking at the Rubens, he said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is authentic.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Director Kim Hyun-do swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that the person in front of him was a spy from the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he exposed to the dark side of the world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s presence felt even scarier.</span></p><p><span style="">The next day, a huge number of VIPs from all over the world came to the museum where Kim Hyun-do worked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello? I am James Trevor, a spokesperson for Pineapple.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The blonde man, James, smiled brightly and shook Kim Hyun-do&#x2019;s hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was very fluent in Korean for an American.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Pineapple was an industry giant famous for their smartphones, so Kim Hyun-do was stunned by their visit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard that you have Rubens&#x2019; Descent of the Cross on display? I got permission from the Hermitage Museum. Can I look at the painting directly for a while?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the first place, the Rubens painting was from the Hermitage Museum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they gave permission, then Kim Hyun-do couldn&#x2019;t say no.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Hyun-do contacted the director of the Hermitage Museum and told him that James had come.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he heard that it was okay to show the painting.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He has confirmed it. I will turn the security devices off for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">James told the man standing behind him something in English.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the man nodded and started to look at the Rubens painting.</span></p><p><span style="">How much time passed?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man looking at the Rubens painting turned pale.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He walked over to James and whispered something in his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;WHAT?! SON OF BITCH!!!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">James, who was wearing a neat suit, pulled at his tie, and started screaming curses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He left the museum without a proper goodbye and called someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Hyun-do didn&#x2019;t speak English, but he seemed to know what the man was saying.</span></p><p><span style="">This...</span></p><p><i><span style="">-It is Mr James.</span></i> <i><span style="">The painting we purchased is a fake.</span></i></p><p><span style="">That would obviously be the content of the call.</span></p><p><span style="">After James left, three Arab oil kings and a wealthy person from China appeared in front of Kim Hyun-do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If all their possessions were combined, then it would be possible to buy a country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Hyun-do felt like he was losing his mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And the reactions of the guests were all the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard curse words from all over the world today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia was screwed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It grew very big.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to Phantom, the billions of dollars they would&#x2019;ve earned had turned into tissue paper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The boss of the Red Mafia would know what it was like to be struck from heaven.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally a disaster.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
