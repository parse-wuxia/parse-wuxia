<p><span style="">Chapter 155 - End of the Revenge #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Chairman Song Won-jin died.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been killed while in hiding.</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza panicked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only a few people in the Taesung Group knew where he was hiding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But how did the killer know where he was hiding?&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, he always stuck with his carefully selected bodyguards.</span></p><p><span style="">Plus, a spy had been planted among Song Won-jin&#x2019;s guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was anything suspicious, then it would&#x2019;ve been reported to the higher-ups immediately.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Song Won-jin ever attempted to leak anything confidential then the spy would make it seem like he committed suicide.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Song Won-jin was just a chess pawn for the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Song Won-jin and his bodyguards were annihilated.</span></p><p><span style="">Who killed him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eventually, an investigator was sent to find out what happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oh my god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The investigator doubted his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything was turned to ashes like a bomb had blown up the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And the black things scattered around were probably...&#xA0;</span><span style="">The investigator gathered them and started analyzing what caused this.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t figure out the exact cause of the explosion because it was so intense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was a firefight, then there would be things like bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The investigator didn&#x2019;t find anything and concluded that Song Won-jin&#x2019;s death was due to a bomb attack.</span></p><p><span style="">The most likely culprit was Kim Tae-sung, the bomber who had bad feelings towards the Taesung Group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the Yakuza prepared for a war against the Bomber.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, they never dreamt that Tae-hyuk had used Robbery and Forgery to erase all signs from the room.</span></p><p><span style="">They were unaware that their enemy was Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There was no need to look with his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to see the positions of the enemies with the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;As expected, the remnants of the Yakuza are gathered here. This means...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The bombs had a wide range of explosion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that was only if the bombs were installed.</span></p><p><span style="">Gathering a large number of guards here was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park put pressure on the prosecutors to catch the Bomber before turning this place into a fortress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, if Tae-hyuk crushed this place, then he would be able to cut his fate with the Yakuza, which had continued since his previous life.</span></p><p><span style="">Yakuza members poured from the other side of the hallway and fired their guns at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tutututu!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Loud noises filled the air that were enough to burst his eardrums.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M-Monster! D-Die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, they couldn&#x2019;t inflict any injuries on Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kikikiki!</span></i></p><p><span style="">By moving Machina, he could easily block the bullets fired at his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is a monster? How many people have you killed in the meantime? Personally, it is a little unfair.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He activated Bullet Time as they fired.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to this, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s perception of time was reduced by dozens of times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like the world moved in slow motion.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Two people behind the wall. And seven across the hallway.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The map showed the people trying to ambush him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He moved forward and easily overpowered the seven opponents.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But what I have to do now is not just get rid of the enemy. I need to turn their gaze away from the Bomber towards me.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to do that, he had to act very loudly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By scanning the map, Tae-hyuk could tell that the Bomber wasn&#x2019;t far from his location.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was one of the points where a bomb should be installed to blow up the laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The next two!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">1/3 of the Yakuza in the institute were already cold bodies on the floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was approaching his limit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how overwhelming the abilities, even the crime skills weren&#x2019;t invincible.</span></p><p><span style="">Bullet Time had a duration of one minute and Machina didn&#x2019;t have endless durability.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he couldn&#x2019;t go to the centre of the institute where Mister Park was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The key to this operation was the Bomber.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk concealed himself in the darkness and watched the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponents were already overwhelmed with panic.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What the hell is this?! Why won&#x2019;t he die? Wasn&#x2019;t he clearly shot?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-The opponent is a g-ghost...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ack! I ran out of bullets! You, do you have any spare mags left?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The opponent is obviously the Bomber! This doesn&#x2019;t make sense!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Call for reinforcements!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the Yakuza members did something they should never do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They tried to confront the enemy away from the important defense points of the fortress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If someone had a good understanding of tactics and strategy then it was something they would&#x2019;ve never done.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Come to think of it, maybe one of them are the descendants of the Japanese who invaded Korea during the Joseon Dynasty? If I think about that time, their decisions were pretty cute.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he attacked the place where the Yakuza were busy servicing their equipment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Truly easy opponents!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a water pipe on the ceiling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He aimed the pistol at it and water started to pour down with a thunderous sound.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Hwaaaaack!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you are in the basement then you should be careful of flooding!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A masked gunman attacked from behind the water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a terrible predicament!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza were soaked in water and randomly fired their guns.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. If you shoot me like this then you won&#x2019;t have enough bullets left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was more difficult than when they were aiming properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to avoid all the random bullet lines.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to defend himself against a few with Machina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the diamond like strength, the Machina couldn&#x2019;t withstand the hail of bullets and started breaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I&apos;m sorry. I was trying to relax. This is the time limit. Now I&#x2019;ll go faster.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza were shocked after hearing Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been relaxed until now?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then showtime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed a pistol in both hands and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber, Kim Tae-sung, grabbed his shaking right arm..</span></p><p><span style="">All the preparations were finished.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He succeeded in installing the bombs in all the places indicated on the map.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he could blow up the institute at any time by just pressing the detonator.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pant... Pant... Pant!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber leaned against the wall and breathed roughly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to run for almost two hours through the institute to install the bombs.</span></p><p><span style="">He heard fighting from a place not far away from him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a war zone with gunshots and shouting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then somebody died.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew who did it.</span></p><p><span style="">The masked man, &#x2018;Phantom.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Miracles were always created from his fingertips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung couldn&#x2019;t do anything but make bombs. He had gotten this far thanks to Phantom.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Biiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Then the radio made a noise.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I guess it is around the time that the installation is finished.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Point G has been completed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then be careful.</span></i> <i><span style="">There might be a few people in the hallways.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t worry, it isn&#x2019;t impossible for you to move.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The Bomber got goose bumps as he realized what Phantom was saying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was something white across the hallway.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a corridor deep underground but he didn&#x2019;t care what was down there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he took a deep breath once he realized what Phantom was suggestion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom...what are you...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I can blow this up right now but it won&#x2019;t be your revenge.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll give you 10 minutes.</span></i> <i><span style="">Finish everything and come to Point A.</span></i> <i><span style="">There will be a vehicle for you to escape.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He closed off contact with Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber gulped and looked at the darkness in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like an abyss that led to hell.</span></p><p><span style="">...It seemed like not even moonlight could penetrate the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber... No, very little remained in Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s heart.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to finish everything before this warmth disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sang-ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The enemies of his wife and daughter were there.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung bit his lip and headed to the underground laboratory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Not long after, Kim Tae-sung arrived in front of a firmly closed door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once it opened...</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">When on Earth did things go wrong?</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park was tense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t been a week since Phantom defeated them in the mafia game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been concentrating on finishing the Psychotropic Incense, but now he received news that Taesung Chemical&#x2019;s chairman Song Won-jin had died.</span></p><p><span style="">The culprit was a researcher who used to work for Taesung Chemical&#x2019;s research institute.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director Jang Ik-sam. What was the name of the researcher?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The elderly man walking nervously around the shelter answered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Kim Tae-sung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. It is obviously more famous under the nickname the Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...that&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;m sorry. I should&#x2019;ve taken care of him properly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Mister Park shouted in a tense voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn...! If you knew that then you should&#x2019;ve reported it properly! Do I have to pay attention to everything?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No matter how great the Bomber is, he won&#x2019;t be able to get in here. At best, he will be crushed by the building.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even if a bomb went off, they were safe inside this shelter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park and Jang Ik-sam were in the core of the research institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a place where confidential secrets that absolutely couldn&#x2019;t be leaked were kept.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The downside was that radio waves couldn&#x2019;t pass through, so communication had to be done through specially designed handsets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it had recently been jammed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No way out...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the door opened and someone entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Jang Ik-sam knew that face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K-Kim Tae-sung! H-How did you get through security...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung aimed a gun at Jang Ik-sam with trembling hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Now, Jang Ik-sam! I will send you to hell!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jang Ik-sam started to laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hahaha! Do you want to kill me with a gun?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jang Ik-sam made a gesture and the bodyguards waiting with him pulled out their guns.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I praise the fact that you made it here. But you are surely dead. Can you kill me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is a lot of talk, Jang Ik-sam!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung fired his gun.</span></p><p><span style="">It flew towards Jang Ik-sam and literally stopped in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponent didn&#x2019;t die.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pfft! Puhahaha! How funny, funny! Didn&#x2019;t you know? This shelter is protected by bulletproof glass! Did you shoot a gun in the army? Aren&#x2019;t you a moderately good shot? Puhuhuhu! Well, it was nice to see you after a long time, but this is the end. Goodbye Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jang Ik-sam motioned to his bodyguards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Apart from the bulletproof glass, he coldly closed the door of the shelter completely by pressing a switch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then no matter how many bombs exploded outside, the dust wouldn&#x2019;t be able to enter here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Plus...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I almost forgot. The special Psychotropic Incense made at the institute is installed in the air vents. If an intruder enters then it can be sprayed. Then what would happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The person responsible for the incense will fall victim to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the guards outside will be sacrificed but it doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Jang Ik-sam smirked and pressed the containment button of the shelter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now the Psychotropic Incense would spread through the entire research institute except for here.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
