<p><span style=""> Chapter 32 - Ill-Fated Relationship from a Past Life #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style=""> Lessons were over.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk stayed in the classroom with An Eun-young.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Give me some recommendations for cram schools.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> An Eun-young was confused by Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Cram schools?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Noona got a job straight after high school, and this time she wants to sit the university entrance exam again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> There was less than a month until this year&#x2019;s university entrance exam, so it was impossible to start preparing for it now.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;When are you going to take the exam?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Next year.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What university is she aiming for? What is its current rating? Liberal arts? Science?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> An Eun-young&#x2019;s specialty came out as she started firing off specific questions.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk scratched his head and replied to the questions that he knew the answer to.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care as long as it isn&#x2019;t expensive. She hasn&#x2019;t studied for several years, so I want her to learn from the basics.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> An Eun-young looked at various cram schools with her phone and checked them thoroughly.&#xA0;</span>In the end, she showed him the homepage of the best place.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Then this one should be the best. The teachers are okay and the pass rate is also the highest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk checked how much the school expenses were.</span></p><p><span style=""> 700,000 won a month.&#xA0;</span>Including food expenses and transportation costs, it would be one million a month.&#xA0;There was one year left, so Ha-ran&#x2019;s tuition fee would be 12 million won.&#xA0;However, this wasn&#x2019;t the end.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;The costs of the textbooks and special lectures... It all costs almost two million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> It was more than 25 million won combined for both of them.</span></p><p><span style=""> An Eun-young spoke while Tae-hyuk was looking at the school expenses page.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I-I looked for the cheapest place possible. The boarding cram schools are three million won a month.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style=""> This was a world of money.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;I wish I had a surplus of funds... Are there any more bounties?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Unfortunately, there were no more big jackpots until next year.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk muttered as if he were making a promise.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I will cling to all of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#xA0;An Eun-young made a fighting posture.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Tae-hyuk, you can do it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes. The three of us should pass next year.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Uh, yes... T-three...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> An Eun-young looked strangely disappointed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;In addition, there are the interviews and essays... It isn&#x2019;t just the exam?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;T-That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> An Eun-young lecture on university admissions began and Tae-hyuk wrote everything down in his notebook.&#xA0;</span>This would be useful to Tae-min, who would sit his university entrance exam in a few years.</p><p><i><span style="">Brr!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> All of a sudden, there was a vibration from his pocket.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Did my stats rise or something?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror, showing nothing on the screen.</span></p><p><span style=""> An Eun-young giggled from where she was watching.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;You mistook your phone with the mirror.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ah, phone...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> He forgot, because most of his notifications came from the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk pulled out the phone from deep within his pocket and checked the contents of the notification. It was a text message from someone.</p><p><i><span style="">-Tae-hyuk I</span></i></p><p><span style=""> The message cut off there.&#xA0;</span>He checked and saw that it came from Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s phone.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Eun-young, I&#x2019;m sorry but I have to leave early. I have an urgent matter so I&#x2019;ll be going first.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;H-huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk grabbed the jacket hanging on his chair and ran out.&#xA0;</span>The contents of the message had been omitted, but he could tell.</p><p><span style=""> &apos;Something big has happened!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> The situation was so urgent that she couldn&#x2019;t even send a message properly.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk called a taxi in order to get home even one minute faster.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Noona, please be safe...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk worried as he rode in the taxi.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Why isn&#x2019;t Kang-suk hyung picking up his phone?!&apos;</span></p><p><span style=""> He must be in a meeting where he needed to turn it off.&#xA0;</span>It had been a while since Tae-hyuk saw Kang-suk&#x2019;s face.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk made a strong fist. He couldn&#x2019;t expect any help from Kang-suk, so he had to get through this with his own strength. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> This was the second time that something unforeseen had happened.&#xA0;</span>Knowing the future wasn&#x2019;t enough, as taking different actions produced different results.</p><p><span style=""> After the Rosario incident, Tae-hyuk had searched for related books in the library.&#xA0;</span>He learnt of the phenomenon called the &#x2018;Time Leap&#x2019;. The Time Leap said that he didn&#x2019;t return to the past with his memories. Instead, an infinite number of parallel words existed, and he obtained the memories of one of those worlds.</p><p><span style=""> Of course, it was just a hypothesis, albeit a convincing one.&#xA0;</span>The book was thick enough to be used as a pillow, but he came to one conclusion. The future wasn&#x2019;t fixed, it was constantly changing. Someday, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s future knowledge would lose its power. Before that, he needed to learn as many crime skills as possible, since it was his second weapon.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Pull yourself together Tae-hyuk. You are walking a tightrope right now.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk arrived at the road near his house and handed the driver a 10,000 won bill. There was no time to get the change.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Please make it in time!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk jumped out and ran home.</span></p><p><span style=""> Fortunately, his sister was at home; however, she wasn&#x2019;t alone.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Seo Ha-ran ~ You didn&#x2019;t pay back our money, and yet you moved to such a good place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> A large number of men were surrounding Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span>They were neatly dressed in suits, but the atmosphere was terrifying.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;If you borrowed money from us, then you should pay it back! Isn&apos;t that right? Kids.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, Hyung-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The man called &#x2018;Hyung-nim&#x2019; seemed to be in his mid-30s. &#xA0;Every time he laughed, a gold tooth quickly flashed as it reflected the bright sunlight.</span></p><p><span style=""> The leader of the group extended a hand as he noticed Tae-hyuk entering.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aigoo. Who is this? Seo Tae-min?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is Tae-hyuk, Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Uh, yes. Tae-hyuk! Come come. The head of the house has come, so let&#x2019;s talk business.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk suppressed his anger and spoke.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;What are you doing in someone else&#x2019;s house? I&#x2019;ll call the police.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> They knew his name.</span></p><p><span style=""> Creditors?</span></p><p><span style=""> Based on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s memories, they never came to his house.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Aigoo! Sir! &#xA0;We aren&#x2019;t bad people. It&#x2019;s just us. We work with unions and are following all of the laws. Do you want to see our business card?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The man pulled a business card from his wallet.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... SY Capital. You are Han Sang-won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. We have come to receive the debt, all according to legitimate procedures.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk stared at Ha-ran, who was shaking with a pale face, from amongst the men.&#xA0;</span>She was biting her lips so hard that blood started to emerge.</p><p><span style=""> This was a legitimate procedure?&#xA0;</span>More than 10 men surrounding a woman was legitimate? Tae-hyuk looked at the baseball bats and iron pipes placed neatly in the corner as threats. The group didn&#x2019;t carry them, but they were willing to use it at any time.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk said towards Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Noona, don&#x2019;t worry. I won&#x2019;t let even one of them touch you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Aigoo ~ Sir! You have a strange misconception. We just came to reclaim the debt! Is there any need to touch her if we receive the money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... What type of debt are you here to take?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;There is a guarantor debt in Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s name... with the interest, it is approximately 300 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;There was a clear exemption.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Their parents had passed away in an accident, leaving behind a huge debt. &#xA0;They were able to solve it by giving up the inheritance.&#xA0;</span>The problem was that the debt was in Ha-ran&#x2019;s name. She couldn&#x2019;t do it, so the last resort was applying for personal bankruptcy. It was a debt that their family had barely escaped from.</p><p><span style=""> Why had it shown up again?</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won extended an envelope.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Read it. This is an order of payment from the courts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk examined the documents. Han Sang-won&#x2019;s words were real.&#xA0;</span>Han Sang-won smiled at him.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Even if there was an exemption, if a claim is made, then the debt will become valid again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> At that moment, Tae-hyuk realized what Han Sang-won was doing.</span></p><p><span style=""> It was a type of illegal collection act that indiscriminately purchased dead debts at a cheap price and used lawsuits to activate them again. If the person couldn&#x2019;t pay, then they would have to register for bankruptcy.&#xA0;</span>Of course, there were no prohibitions or penalties, as it was a legitimate business. If someone was hit by this, then they would become a slave, paying off the debt for life due to the huge interest.</p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won waved Ha-ran&#x2019;s bankbook.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;At any rate, I had forgotten about it. Then not long ago, you bought this house, so I hurried to file a lawsuit to get an order of payment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The house...?</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk instantly realized why this had happened.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;They found out about the house and came sniffing around...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Creditors could view the property details of those who owed them money.&#xA0;</span>In the end, money brought the hyenas around.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk bit his lip and glanced at Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span>Her face looked like she would burst into tears at any moment. However, her desire to protect the money at all costs was seen in her eyes.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;At any rate, tell me your password and nobody will get hurt. Yes? How long has it been? I couldn&#x2019;t even eat lunch. The account name is Cho Kang-suk? I didn&#x2019;t expect you to keep this money in a bank account under someone else&#x2019;s name. Do you want to be kicked out of the house in this cold winter? First of all, I&#x2019;ll just take this money. I am a very merciful person. Haha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Cho Kang-suk?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Ha-ran had deposited money into a bankbook in Kang-suk&#x2019;s name. It was her own idea.&#xA0;</span>If they found the cash, then they would have just taken it. However it was harder with a bankbook that had a password.</p><p><i><span style="">Wooduk!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk grinded his teeth together.</span></p><p><span style=""> These guys hadn&#x2019;t just come. They had been here for at least half a day.&#xA0;</span>Han Sang-won had the bankbook and seal in his hands, which were clearly taken from Ha-ran.&#xA0;<span style="">However, she didn&#x2019;t tell them the password until the end.</span></p><p><span style=""> They didn&#x2019;t touch Ha-ran directly.&#xA0;</span>However, Ha-ran&#x2019;s expression made it obvious that they had threatened her. How had she felt when she was surrounded by 10 men?</p><p><span style=""> Ha-ran had bravely fought alone.&#xA0;</span>In order to protect the precious money necessary for the family&#x2019;s dreams...</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk wanted to kill these people right now.&#xA0;</span>But first, he had to secure Ha-ran&#x2019;s safety.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... The password is Public Employment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Hahaha! As expected from a friend! Hey kids, let&#x2019;s go. Pack up your tools.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The henchmen chuckled and started to pick up the equipment they brought.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Sir! We have just received 50 million won! Although, don&#x2019;t you know that there is still 250 million won left? See you next time. Hahahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won and his henchmen were gone in an instant.</span></p><p><span style=""> Ha-ran&#x2019;s shoulders shook.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk... S-sorry.. Noona is a fool... Huaaang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> In the end, Ha-ran burst into tears.&#xA0;</span>They were the desperate tears that she had tried to keep from falling.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... I will make them pay for every tear that fell from Noona&#x2019;s eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk gazed coldly at Han Sang-won&#x2019;s business card.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;SY Capital...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Seo Ha-ran had fought against them to the end.</span></p><p><span style=""> Now it was Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s turn to fight. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Noona. Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll get it back tenfold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk stood up.</span></p><p><span style=""> He would put everything he had into destroying them.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
