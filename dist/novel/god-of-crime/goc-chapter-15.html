<p><span style="">Chapter 15 - Having Too Much of a Good Thing #2&#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s power was considerable since he was the son of a politician.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the day after he declared war.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt it the moment he went to school.</span></p><p><span style="">The mood of the students had changed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Seo Tae-hyuk. Is he late again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shh. Talk quietly. He&#x2019;s going to hear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What does it matter if he hears? Will he bite my head off? Or beat me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...T-that. Last night...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;V-violent incident? Hiik!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">This was just at first glance.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Buzz buzz!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Many students on the road were talking about Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he was a celebrity!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... That isn&#x2019;t it. Also, aren&#x2019;t the rumors about me spreading quicker than I initially thought?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought that at the least, it would take one more day for them to spread.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had become the worst gangster of the school overnight.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Conquering all the bad groups in the area. Bullying money from students in other schools. Using violence. Playing naughty pranks on girls passing by. ... I&#x2019;m not some hero of a manhwa!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">All of this occurred in around half a day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was ridiculous, but the students believed the rumors either way.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk could guess why it spread so quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang had probably used SNS (Korean social media) as a means to spread these rumors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He probably opened around half a dozen chat rooms, in which he freely slandered Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rumors would then blow up by themselves as they were reinterpreted and spread to more people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was repeated so many times that most of the students now knew of Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s bad deeds.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed bitterly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He really is the same as his father.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Manipulating public opinion using the media.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although there was no proof behind that claim, it was still a clever use of both technology and psychology.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was doing bad things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if someone didn&#x2019;t believe that claim at first, their doubts would soon turn to conviction after hearing several people repeating it.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang had many friends, and put the money that came from being the son of a politician to good use.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were at least 10 people involved in this matter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That number was enough to incite most of the students in school.</span></p><p><span style="">Now no one would believe him if Tae-hyuk accused Park Sung-kwang of cheating.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I just wanted to be a model student. Isn&#x2019;t this the opposite from what I wanted?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">Furthermore, it was obvious that it wouldn&#x2019;t end with just this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Oh my god...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">A miracle was occurring as Tae-hyuk walked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Students parted in front of him like he was the plague.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The situation was more serious than he thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Once he opened the door and walked in, the loud classroom suddenly became quiet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People started whispering in small voices; and although he didn&#x2019;t hear them, he knew what they were talking about.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked to his seat and sat down, prompting the person next to him to increase the distance between their seats.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young, sitting in the seat in front of him, spoke in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Is this Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wiped at his eyes like he was moved.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you believe in my innocence?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;O-Of course! S-sorry. Because of me... Do you regret it now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I&#x2019;m kidding... Why are you so serious?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">That was just in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t hesitate as he replied to An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about? If I could travel back in time, then I would still save Class President.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was natural.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t uncommon to form connections with intelligent people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh...? Eu? Yes? Yes... I-I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s face instantly turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">She tried to answer but couldn&#x2019;t speak.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then An Eun-young raised her finger like she suddenly remembered something.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, right. The student adviser said for you to go see him straight away...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. Maybe this incident has even entered the ears of the teachers. Either that, or Park Sung-kwang is planning to beat me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;L-Let&#x2019;s go together...! I will tell Teacher-nim that Tae-hyuk did nothing wrong!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. Recently I have become friendly with Class President.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes. Friendly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then would they believe Class President&#x2019;s claim of my innocence?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was dumbfounded at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Still!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will go to the office now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&apos;ll be waiting at the door!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Despite his words, An Eun-young still wanted to come along.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk chose not to refuse anymore.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Once he went to the office, the student adviser greeted him more angrily than usual.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk! Tae-hyuk! Tae-hyuk! Hey, you son of a bitch. Why did you do it? It has only been a few days since you promised to be reborn. Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You bastard! I know. I know it all! Don&#x2019;t try to lie and deceive me. Tell the truth, and I will consider extenuating your circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t know what you&apos;re talking about.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard... Denying it until the end! There was a witness, a witness! Did you think no one saw you when you hit a student last night? His leg was broken so badly that he has at least 12 weeks of recovery! I thought you were a good person who got into small trouble. Have I been deceived? Say something, you son of a bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t even laugh due to the sheer absurdity of the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I harmed a student?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah! It seems I was mistaken about you. Showing no signs of remorse and reflection after brazenly hurting someone. Who? Kim Jin-soo! I went to the hospital last night and saw him. He was beaten half to death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clenched his hands into tight fists.</span></p><p><span style="">He had thought that it was just a bunch of rumors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But someone was really hurt?</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jin-soo, who had been fine just yesterday, was now in the hospital. What really happened?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Park Sung-kwang. You really went this far.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had broken the leg of his follower just to frame Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt anger boiling inside of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahyu. This shameless guy. In my heart, I want to make you exactly like Jin-soo. Yet, I&#x2019;m very sad because I can&#x2019;t. At any rate, a disciplinary committee will be held after the test tomorrow. This will probably result in a suspension or worse. By the way, I will be strongly arguing that you be expelled.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The smile disappeared from Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Expulsion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If An Eun-young wouldn&#x2019;t separate herself from him, then would they be kicked out of school together?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt a fierce anger towards the man called Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are still denying it like this until the end! Very well, you can go now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, by the way, Teacher-nim. Have you ever received a bribe from Park Sung-kwang?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What did you say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nothing. Keep up the good work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk left the office without looking back.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young, who had been listening to the conversation outside, looked like she was about to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk... R-really. I&#x2019;m s-sorry...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and stroked her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, I should be the one to say sorry. In fact, I even wanted to play this little game at first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-play?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But now, I think that I should go to war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had planned to steal the test paper submitted by Park Sung-kwang and make him sit in the re-test alone.</span></p><p><span style="">But that wasn&#x2019;t enough anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a dirty fight where one of the two people had to be finished.</span></p><p><span style="">Either Seo Tae-hyuk would be expelled, or Park Sung-kwang would be ruined.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. I thought something like this would happen after I threw the bait.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shortly after Park Sung-kwang had declared war, Tae-hyuk had called his father&#x2019;s secretary and laid a trap.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it worked properly, then it would be very fatal for Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">And...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk explained his plan to An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">Her cooperation was necessary in order for it to be successful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I&#x2019;ll give it a try. But will it really succeed? It seems to heavily rely on luck...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied in a confident voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will do it somehow. Believe in me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes. I trust you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Phew. I sound so irresponsible since she doesn&#x2019;t know about the Demon Revealing Mirror. It is good that she still believes in me.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed with relief. An Eun-young trusted him to such a strange degree.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he had no intention of betraying her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, shall I start the cheating?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
