<p><span style="">Chapter 100 - Accomplice #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae, can you give me the newspaper clippings?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho, who was organizing the materials at the investigation headquarters, called out to Kang-suk sitting on the other side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were investigating all of the tracks of one man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The workload was much greater than he had thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t been able to go home for a few days since he returned from the Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same with Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was writing a report that had to be handed in to his superiors in a few hours.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho received the report from Kang-suk and checked the necessary items before yawning and getting up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is never ending... A genius investigator is doing paperwork. I should ask for more people from the chief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The taste is gone. Let&apos;s go out and get a cup of coffee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho&#x2019;s face brightened at the thought of taking a break.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk exited the investigation headquarters and walked to a vending machine in the hallway.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho followed behind him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was late so there was no one else in the hallway.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out a 1,000 won bill from his pocket and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Black?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Today I am a sugar-type person. Sugar is required for my head to work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? I am originally a coffee shop person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk bought coffee with lots of sugar and cream.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people talked to each other while drinking coffee with their backs against the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it about time to receive the DNA results?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It should be coming by this evening or tomorrow. If that is a match then we should be able to get some support.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho was waiting for the identity of the body found a few days ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the only clue they got from solving Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s puzzle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They needed to know who it was so that they could specify that Park Sung-yul was the culprit in this case.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Kang-suk&#x2019;s phone started ringing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It comes just as we are speaking about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The phone screen showed brief results along with the autopsy from the coroner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are the results out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. There is a 98% probability that it is a family member of the boarding house landlord.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Then now we can start a full-fledged investigation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was clear that Park Sung-yul was involved in another murder.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gulped down the bit of coffee that was remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he squeezed the paper cup with his fist and threw it into the trash.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t we have something to do before that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Something to do before the investigation?</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho looked at Kang-suk with confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sob... J-Ji-young...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s boarded house owner and Kim Ji-young&#x2019;s mother burst out crying.</span></p><p><span style="">The National Institute of Scientific Investigation had finished their investigation into the corpse and had it cremated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The owner of the boarding house collapsed as her daughter returned after four years.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho said in a small voice to Kang-suk sitting next to him,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was too involved in the investigation and I forgot about the most important thing for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stroked his head without saying anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho was surprised and moved two meters away from Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyah! S-Sunbae! Is this your taste?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...What are you saying? Do you want me to turn your head into a rock?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho desperately waved his hands,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry to keep you waiting like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out a handkerchief and handed it to the boarding house owner.</span></p><p><span style="">She accepted it and spoke while wiping her tears.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, Detective-nim. I&#x2019;m really grateful that Ji-young is home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t know how long I&#x2019;ve been searching. Travelling around the country and putting up missing flyers... Every day I go to a place that Ji-young would frequent... If you hadn&#x2019;t found her...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes turned red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time his heart was sore from hearing thank you.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now that you found her, I can have the funeral... I can send off my daughter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk opened his mouth and said to the owner of the boarding house.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for your cooperation. Please contact me about the funeral.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The owner of the boarding house bowed before getting up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she whispered as she embraced the precious urn.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ji-young, Mother is here. I baked your favourite ribs... You must&#x2019;ve been hungry for a while huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk and Hyun-ho looked at each other and said nothing as the boarding house owner left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk leaned back on the couch and sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He put his wrist to his forehead like he was tired.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A hoarse voice emerged from his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That aunty... Until the end, she didn&#x2019;t say any words of resentment towards Park Sung-yul. Rather, she might feel regret that he became a killer. What is that bastard? People... Damn...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho gazed at Kang-suk and said in a low voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae. The average of missing people is over 30,000 a year. Not all of them are the victims of a hidden crime but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stood up and shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you glad you found the body now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;m sorry. I know you don&#x2019;t think that, I think I&#x2019;m a little tired.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s okay. If you&apos;re tired, do you want to go to the sauna? I&#x2019;ll pay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No thanks. Anyway, did you investigate what I asked you to?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It had been 10 days since finding Ji-young&#x2019;s body. In addition, Park Sung-yul had remained silent since then.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So how long would it take to find the remaining 12 people that he said he killed?</span></p><p><span style="">The best way was to plant a spy in the Blue Dragon Prison where Park Sung-yul was staying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He tried to find someone using all his connections, but it was in vain.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a lot of acting to be done. It is too much for the criminals I know.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t hear a positive answer from Hyun-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I told you to check with the other detectives.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Detectives who caught criminals were well aware of their ecology.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, they might know people inside criminal organizations.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know. Most of them are busy with what they are doing right now. In addition, criminals who are free changed after hearing the words Blue Dragon. They said that monsters are imprisoned there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would do it himself if he could.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were two criminals who knew Kang-suk&#x2019;s face in Blue Dragon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One was Park Sung-yul, the target, and the other one was Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I have no choice but to ask him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho recalled how Kang-suk said a few days ago that only Phantom could do this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, collaborating with Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is the best. Didn&#x2019;t you hear about the Killer case? Phantom can imitate other people&#x2019;s faces. He also knows a lot about criminals. Furthermore, don&#x2019;t you remember the Bomber incident? He penetrated the psychology of the culprit. If it is the Phantom, he will be able to get everything from Park Sung-yul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho fought with Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to acknowledge it, but Phantom had a terrifying ability.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;But will he want to be a source of police information?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will fall to my knees and beg him if he contacts me. He isn&#x2019;t a sociopath who doesn&#x2019;t understand a person&#x2019;s feelings. If I ask...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to find out the truth of the murders, a detective was willing to fall to his knees before a murderer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But Hyun-ho didn&#x2019;t want to see that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he said something with a determined expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How about hiring him with money? He did ask for money in return for capturing criminals.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, this isn&#x2019;t like the Bomber case. I don&#x2019;t think 100 million won will come out of the budget for this case... However, it does seem like the best method. I&#x2019;ll ask the commissioner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&#x2019;t have enough budget then I&#x2019;ll add a little bit. I&#x2019;ll cooperate as much as possible with Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk nodded quietly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He decided to try everything he could, with kneeling as a last resort.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Anyway, first Phantom needs to contact me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Keep talking, he might call just because your voice will tickle his ears.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aish, it can&#x2019;t be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Dururu-</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was suddenly a call.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk stared at the phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The called ID said God of Crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh! Sunbae! Did Phantom actually come? You did tickle his ears.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shush. I need some quiet to receive the call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pressed the call button and brought the phone to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Have you been well?</span></i> <i><span style="">Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gulped and quietly opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was talking to An Eun-young while lying in bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to stay in the hospital for two, maybe three more weeks. Please tell Teacher Jung Nam-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Y-Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">But if you are hospitalized, come to our hospital...</span></i> <i><span style="">No.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you can move, will you come to our hospital tomorrow?</span></i> <i><span style="">There is a double room empty.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I have to stay here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-T-Then let me know the address!</span></i> <i><span style="">I will back you a delicious lunch and go visit!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young had been strangely active starting from a week ago.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk discovered that her mother had passed away before An Eun-young arrived at the hospital.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He then used his crime skills to deceive her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He acted like her mother who was happy about hearing her daughter&#x2019;s admission into university.</span></p><p><span style="">He definitely did it for An Eun-young, but he still couldn&#x2019;t help wondering if it was okay.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Class President would think it was the truth for the rest of her life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps he had committed an unreasonable crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he felt guilt every time he heard An Eun-young&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I think tomorrow will be okay. Can you come then?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. The place...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave her the address of the hospital.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was going to shatter this place in a few days, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be too bad to have a break before that.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then I will see you tomorrow.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll make a lot of delicious things!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ended the conversation with An Eun-young and called Kang-suk this time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he used the Phantom dedicated phone.</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can directly imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if it was due to his crime skills or his stamina that was over 50 points, but Tae-hyuk showed great resilience.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Looking at his outward appearance right now, it didn&#x2019;t seem like he had been shot in the head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then it is time to move.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, he wanted to be more stable for a week or so.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was something that shouldn&#x2019;t be missed today.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wasn&#x2019;t Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s second puzzle released three days later?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul, the serial killer who murdered 14 people.</span></p><p><span style="">He said that he treated the victims he liked like a puzzle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk only had rough information about him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His memories were faint and blurry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was already dead when Tae-hyuk entered the prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The cause of death was suicide.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul had revealed his puzzle pieces to the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt great joy when he saw the embarrassed police being unable to solve it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was a police investigator who was called a genius.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it took a long time, he ended up solving all of the puzzles.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul was found dead in the bathroom.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew the ending of the Park Sung-yul case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, only a few knew about the contents of the puzzle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, he would&#x2019;ve ignored this case since all of the victims had already died and were hidden somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t get any affinity points from them and they also didn&#x2019;t have weapons that could be used like the Triads killer.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had a reason to grab Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the Blue Dragon Prison, the gold bars hidden by the Japanese were hidden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be hard to enter there, even with Phantom&#x2019;s abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He intended to use the pretext of cooperating with the police in order to infiltrate Blue Dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hopefully, I can eat all the gold alone.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Either way, it would solve the case that would cause the police&#x2019;s mind to rot over the next two years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It absolutely wouldn&#x2019;t be a loss for the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk opened his mouth after confirming that Kang-suk had received the call.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Have you been well? Detective Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">P-Phantom...!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seem to be working on a hard puzzle while I rested.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">...How did you know?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is a trade secret. I contacted you today because I wanted to give the police a nice present.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">More than that, what about the bombs and weapons from the killer?</span></i> <i><span style="">If you hand them over then I will talk to the commissioner about reducing your other sins...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;I definitely gave you the opportunity. It was the police who betrayed me. At any rate, the bombs are in a very safe place. So the only thing left is to talk to you in person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You want to meet?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The time is two days later in the evening. I will contact you again with further details.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">W-Wait a minute...!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ignored Kang-suk&#x2019;s cries and hung up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the news came, the police would be upset.</span></p><p><span style="">He closed his eyes and thought about how he could get the most out of this.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he should take a break.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
