<p><span style="">Chapter 18 - Having Too Much of a Good Thing #5</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">36 hours before he implemented the test swap plan that required the use of his crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk met the secretary of Park Seong-ho at a coffee shop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, so you wanted to know what it is like to be a politician&#x2019;s secretary?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you have any questions then please, feel free to ask. I am a sunbae in your department, and this isn&#x2019;t a particularly difficult request.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bowed and spoke his appreciation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, Sunbae-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, you are part of the political science department at K University, correct?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I am student number 15.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! A freshman. At first glance, I thought you were a high school student.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk awkwardly scratched the back of his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sunbae-nim also looks very young. I heard that you were student number 97.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I am but a complete fossil. Then, shall we start the interview?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the secretary as a political science university student seeking an interview.</span></p><p><span style="">This was all in order to obtain the secretary&#x2019;s voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to imitate a voice using the Voice Modulation skill, he had to meet someone and directly listen to their voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The skill couldn&#x2019;t be activated through a recording or a phone call.</span></p><p><span style="">The interview took around 20 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">The secretary was currently showing a very pleasant expression, an aftereffect of meeting a hoobae from his university.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had one final question.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Finally, there is something I always wanted to know. If the politician did something morally wrong, what should the secretary do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The secretary&#x2019;s eyes widened in response, as if he was surprised by the unexpected question.</span></p><p><span style="">He sat in the chair and thought hard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A secretary is a senator&#x2019;s hands and feet. Even if he commits any wrongdoing, it is still right to follow him silently. In some cases, senators will amputate their arms if need be. However, I am talking to my cute hoobae who wants to become a secretary, so that isn&#x2019;t a realistic answer. I&#x2019;ll try to mix in my own opinions as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The secretary took a sip of his sugarless, bitter black coffee.</span></p><p><span style="">He seemed to be looking somewhere into the distance, instead of at Tae-hyuk who was currently sitting in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, a secretary is the senator&#x2019;s hands and feet; however, I think secretaries should also have a conscience that is able to judge wrong from right. If the senator is walking down the street in the wrong direction, it is the secretary&#x2019;s job to inform them so. Anyways, that&#x2019;s just my personal opinion. A secretary&#x2019;s words might just fall on deaf ears.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The secretary laughed softly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. I have definitely learned a lot from you today. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bowed, fully displaying his gratitude.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The secretary laughed, and seemed to like it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, should I buy you dinner this evening?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made an apologetic expression and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Really, I must thank you very much, but I still need to submit my report by tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. It has been a long time since I&#x2019;ve even thought about university. It was great to see you. Please call at the next opportunity and I&#x2019;ll be sure to have a drink with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The secretary left the cafe with a regretful expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk remained in his seat and took out a notebook from his bag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The word, &#x2018;blacklist&#x2019;, was written on the front cover in neat handwriting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a book that contained the names of 120 criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The book depicted the crimes they committed and detailed how they got caught. Tae-hyuk wrote down all of the things he remembered from those 15 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A book that contained future events.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">It was one of the two weapons that Seo Tae-hyuk had.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. Let&apos;s see...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk found the page he was looking for near the end of the notebook.</span></p><p><span style="">Blacklist NO.117, Park Seong-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A politician who committed numerous wrongdoings since becoming a senator.</span></p><p><span style="">It would happen approximately two years from now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Due to the secretary&#x2019;s declaration of conscience, most of the senator&#x2019;s crimes were revealed, and he went to prison.</span></p><p><span style="">The charges ranged from bribery to the instigation of murders. Still, Park Seong-ho only received a jail sentence of four years, of which he only served one. He was released on parole for the other three on good behaviour.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had never met Park Seong-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Seong-ho had a great deal of prestige within the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was less like he was staying in a prison, and more like he was staying at a luxury hotel.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk clearly remembered the day that Park Seong-ho was caught.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Not only did he commit numerous acts of corruption, he also did not hesitate to use gangs to eliminate any in his way.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, all of his sins were revealed by his secretary, who couldn&#x2019;t stand doing the dirty work for the senator any longer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The raised dog had risen to bite his own leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Park Seong-ho&#x2019;s secretary... No, student number 97 of K University&#x2019;s political science department, Lee Ki-hwan. You will commit numerous evil deeds in the next two years, until you can&#x2019;t tolerate the weight of your sins, and make a declaration of conscience in the end. Before that happens, I will make you a loyalist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk changed his voice to Lee Ki-hwan&#x2019;s using Voice Modulation. </span><span style="">He then pulled out Lee Ki-hwan&#x2019;s phone that he had stolen during the interview.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a number that he called and hung up on several times a day.</span></p><p><span style="">What was Lee Ki-hwan thinking as Tae-hyuk now held this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">All Tae-hyuk was doing now was profiting off of Lee Ki-hwan&#x2019;s efforts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello. I was to make a report to the press director. Yes, I am Park Seong-ho&#x2019;s secretary, Lee Ki-hwan.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was just doing what Lee Ki-hwan would&#x2019;ve done several years later.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang flopped onto the ground with a flustered expression, a smartphone with DMB functionality in his hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All channels were broadcasting about Park Seong-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">The current situation was like an onion. The more someone peeled, the more that was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This can&#x2019;t be... F-Father...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah, he played very nicely with the leader of a crime syndicate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No way, perhaps...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang stared blankly at the sky, unable to believe the reality revealed in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a spark formed in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Seo. Tae. Hyuk! This was all done by you! &#xA0;I will kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How? Will you do it directly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang called out to his subordinate.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kim Jin-soo! Where are you? Come out right now...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He broke his leg, so why are you looking for him so urgently?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang made a sound that was a cross between a moan and a scream, and charged towards Tae-hyuk in despair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Be careful, this place is the roof.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He lost his temper and tried to hit Tae-hyuk with his fists, who narrowly dodged them.</span></p><p><span style="">They slightly scraped Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s side, triggering the Robbery skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Please select the item you want to steal!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror and chose Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s waistband.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed that he was lucky, or that his opponent just had bad luck. Robbery had succeeded on the second attempt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuhuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden, Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s pants fell down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t move properly because his legs were trapped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think you should give up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Park Sung-kwang didn&#x2019;t give up, and forced his body to move as he aimed at Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">But in the end, his body lost its balance and he fell onto a fence that was set up around the perimeter of the roof.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The fence was unable to endure the weight of a human and started to fall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It should have been able to endure the weight of three or four humans.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the result of bad construction due to politicians being bribed.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kiiiiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang shrieked as his body started to fall to the ground along with the fence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he fell, then he would die.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">He grabbed Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s collar and pulled him up onto the rooftop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You haven&#x2019;t paid your dues yet. You shouldn&#x2019;t die like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had received only one million won from Park Sung-kwang. The rest would be paid after the test results came out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, I don&#x2019;t think you will be able to give it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s legs had collapsed out of the fear of death. The area around his groin had become damp, and he was literally stunned.</span></p><p><span style="">News about Park Seong-ho was spewing from the smartphone dropped onto the roof.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An arrest warrant was issued and a full-scale investigation had begun.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk formed a finger gun with his hand, and pointed towards Park Sung-kwang, who had fainted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Tae-hyuk, are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young asked with a concerned expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ouchh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was sitting on a bed in the infirmary, holding an ice pack to his swollen face.</span></p><p><span style="">Although the situation was somewhat clear, it didn&#x2019;t exactly end well.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang was rushed away in an ambulance. </span><span style="">Despite the opposition of Jung Nam-ho, a disciplinary committee was held for Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The result was a one month suspension and 40 hours of community service.</span></p><p><span style="">Causing a disturbance in the broadcasting room. School property damage. Committing violence. These were his crimes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026; Well, I didn&#x2019;t think I would be proclaimed innocent even with the broadcast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-But...! Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t do anything wrong!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Rather, things had worked out pretty well.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk had achieved first in the test results. Almost all the teachers, except Jung Nam-ho, suspected that there was cheating going on.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, they decided on a retest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, if he took the test now, then his average would be around 70 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk was suspended from tomorrow on. The retest would be taken a month later.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it is okay since I got revenge for Class President. Instead, I want to ask you something. Please help me study in the next month and in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young tearfully said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Of course! I&apos;ll teach you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">How much could An Eun-young, the owner of the studying skill, raise his grade in one month?&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">One thing was certain, he would study until he died.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Although he couldn&#x2019;t get everything he wanted, he decided to be satisfied with this much.</span></p><p><span style="">More than anything else.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I no longer need to steal any more strange things!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had used three affinity points on an attribute for &#x2018;Robbery.&#x2019; If the skill was accidentally activated, then he could decide what to steal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk. I&apos;ll wipe off the blood on your mouth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I&apos;m sorry. Please.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young grabbed a towel and approached Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, An Eun-young tripped on the bed sheet that had trailed to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, she fell onto Seo Tae-hyuk who was sitting on the bed, resulting in An Eun-young&#x2019;s body laying on top of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuaaaaak! I suddenly fell!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young shrieked and her head hit Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s.</span></p><p><span style="">He smeled something faintly sweet.</span></p><p><span style="">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Please select the item you want to steal!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;......&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk removed An Eun-young from his side and pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">-Underwear (Top)</span></p><p><span style="">-Underwear (Bottom)</span></p><p><span style="">-S...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No! It still hasn&#x2019;t changed under these circumstances!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t pick something in a hurry, then he would end up stealing something random.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk chose the top option.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was lying next to him and couldn&#x2019;t understand the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk called out her name.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-young.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Uh, yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you want to see magic once more?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s face turned red as she understood what he meant.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s information came up on the Demon Revealing Mirror that Tae-hyuk had thrown on the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">[An Eun-young]&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">-Title: A Model Student in Love</span></p><p><span style="">[The details aren&#x2019;t available due to your low rating.]</span></p><p><span style="">A single word had completely changed the meaning, but Tae-hyuk had no idea about it.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
