<p><span style="">Chapter 58: Black Sheep Exodus #5 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-President Kim! What are you doing? The contract wasn&#x2019;t finished?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;L-Lee Cheol-su...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guests were completely overwhelmed by Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had only watched the slaughter on the monitors from a safe place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, now the danger had neared them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like going to the cinema to watch a horror movie and having a ghost popping out of the screen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a crisis that they had never anticipated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guests fell to the ground to avoid the explosion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No one had the courage to stop Tae-hyuk directly.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young kept his composure and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Is that real dynamite?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and detached a stick of dynamite from his body and held it up in the air for everyone to see.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why? Do you want to experience it directly with your body? Ah, I see that there is no fire. Does anyone here smoke?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hiiik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guests on the ground shook their heads desperately.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In anybody wants to experiment then tell me. I&#x2019;ll let you feel it with your body. Oh, please don&#x2019;t move carelessly. My coworker has installed the same thing all over the building.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Me, me! I did it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The butterfly mask raised her hand as if to appeal to the audience.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keok! Already...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young moaned.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he looked at the dynamite around his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a fake bomb made using the Forgery skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Crude chemicals were combined to create something with 1/20th of the original explosive power.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only person who would die was the person holding it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was an explosion here, then Tae-hyuk would be the only one killed.</span></p><p><span style="">He increased the realism of the fakes through the Counterfeit skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fake dynamite was created by combining Forgery and Counterfeit.</span></p><p><span style="">How many people here could do this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how coarsely a fake explosive was crafted, it would still explode if set on fire.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had participated in the Death Circus all night while keeping it on his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His mental state absolutely wasn&#x2019;t normal.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, there is no detonator, so the wick needs to be set on fire directly. That is safe enough.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Break the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">In order to do that, it wasn&#x2019;t enough to get rid of Kim Joon-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t destroy the guests, who were the consumers, then a second and third Death Circus would appear.</span></p><p><span style="">That&#x2019;s why he asked Moonlight Flower to steal their information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he asked if it was possible, Moonlight Flower nodded with a casual expression.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an absolute secret that must never be leaked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was protected by digital security from a professional company with several layers of passwords which unfortunately belonged to her family.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Moonlight Flower... No, Yoo Ha-yang. The 3rd generation daughter of a huge security company...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Once coincidences were repeated, it become inevitability. </span><span style="">In the end, Choi Sung-yeol and Kim Joon-young themselves leaked all of the information to the security company that they believed would protect them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well. No one would&#x2019;ve thought about Ha-yang noona.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Yoo Ha-yang, who was smiling thoughtlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I need to pay off this debt.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bowed to Ha-yang who played a key role in destroying the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moonlight Flower just laughed with a strange expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed the number of people in the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were approximately 15 masked people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young had five bodyguards in black suits.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also seven black suits in the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he added Kim Joon-young and Choi Sung-yeol in the count, then it was exactly 29 people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you sign the contract? You said that you would participate in the next Death Circus as a wolf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Betrayer!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. What bad manners. I intend to follow the contract. But unfortunately, I am a busy person. Therefore, I would like to proceed with the next Death Circus today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled happily.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t all the new participants gathered here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guests who realized what he meant screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. Isn&#x2019;t it enjoyable to be the protagonists of a stage at least once? Ah right. Of course, I&apos;ll participate. The contract states that I&#x2019;ll get 10 million won for killing one person. Furthermore, if I kill more than 10 people, then there will be an incentive. So how much money can I make this time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chairman Sung Won-jin was lying on the ground and he grit his teeth together in anger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What? They would participate in the Death Circus from now on?&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he had a chance then the first thing he would do was to kill Lee Cheol-su.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he worked with all the guests gathered here...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, that lion mask over there. You seem to be plotting something. Is it really possible? Don&#x2019;t I have this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk tapped the dynamite on his body.</span></p><p><span style="">Sung Won-jin screamed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had forgotten for a while but Lee Cheol-su had the dynamite.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be impossible to harm him, even if they attacked as a group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, in a 1:1 match...</span></p><p><span style="">Wait, they had to fight that monster?&#xA0;</span><span style="">No!&#xA0;</span><span style="">They absolutely couldn&#x2019;t win!&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before, they had been enjoying his actions through the monitor, but now they had to go against him in reality.</span></p><p><span style="">Sang Won-jin&#x2019;s face distorted with despair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he shook his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was his complete defeat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guests who realized that they would have to fight a monster fainted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s start the second one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Until the closing of the new Death Circus -</span></p><p><span style="">480 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh... Tired.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stretched as he watched the sun rise and asked An Eun-jeong, who was quietly standing beside him,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you sorry that they won&#x2019;t be killed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, it hadn&#x2019;t been possible to open a new stage with the guests who came to watch the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was due to the police who received a report and arrived on the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-jeong were able to escape the building safely with the help of Moonlight Flower.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That woman truly ran very fast.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moonlight Flower had reminded Tae-hyuk that he made a promise to go to the amusement park with her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she waved her hand and disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong bit her lip until it was bloody and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...No. I am just lucky to have survived. Then what will happen to them now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They will be judged by the law. I left a lot of evidence behind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. Then running away like this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had removed all evidence that An Eun-jeong had worked for Tiwai.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fact that she was involved in this incident would disappear from the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should thank the fact that you have a good sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Never let tears flow from the eyes of your family because of your actions again. Otherwise I will punish you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned and started heading somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong smiled at his retreating form and shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you so much! Saving my life and my family... Ah! This man! Listen until the end!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong sighed and returned home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The things she experienced that night felt like a dream.</span></p><p><span style="">Exactly one week passed by.</span></p><p><span style="">She had a proper job, not an illegal one like the multilevel scheme.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a cashier job to calculate the goods that the customers purchased.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a hard job where she had to stand for eight hours a day, but it felt like heaven compared to life in the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">At night, she went to a cram school to prepare for her entrance exams.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wanted to go to university.</span></p><p><span style="">If she worked hard every day without doing illegal work, would she someday be recognized by her parents?</span></p><p><span style="">Yes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She would go and greet her parents on New Year&#x2019;s Day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong laughed at the thought.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Clothes OK. Gift OK.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong turned around in the mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time she wore a suit since working at Tiwai.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That salary was twice what she was receiving now, but she felt like she had been doing something wrong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And in the end, she had to participate in the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">What would have happened if she hadn&#x2019;t met Lee Cheol-su?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is he doing now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, she didn&#x2019;t know anything about Lee Cheol-su.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had tremendous skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was he using it to capture other criminals?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was apparent that he was doing a big job.</span></p><p><span style="">A strange confidence rose now that she was wearing her best clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! Eun-jeong fighting!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong gave a small shouted and headed out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was returning home, where her family was gathered, for the first time in ages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was only her sister and father but she felt full of something.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is it really U-Unni? Unni!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her tearful sister threw open the door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong embraced her sister and stroked her hair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I can finally see my little sister...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had cried when she thought that she would go to hell without seeing her family.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong remembered the face of that man and laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, she was able to meet her family again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was like a hero of justice who beat the villains and then disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am entering. Is Father home?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. But... I have a friend over. I called him to eat because he said he would be alone on New Years...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-young mumbled with a strange expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. My little sister. Is he your boyfriend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Eun-young&#x2019;s face turned red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong gently patted her sister on the head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was already big enough to bring a boyfriend home.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no! He is just a friend that I study with!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. I see. I understand. I will trust you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, the voice of man was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-jeong came? It&#x2019;s been a while. It is cold. Come in quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was back after running away from home a few years ago, but her family acted like it was natural for her to come here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes turned red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, she would make sure to act like a daughter to her father.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She vowed to do so.</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong walked towards the room where her father was waiting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? A guest?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her father and Eun-young&#x2019;s friend were playing chess.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Eun-young&#x2019;s friend. This guy. You are very wily. It is a lot of fun playing chess with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her father chuckled with a smile on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her father was being overwhelmed as he said those words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was over. The opponent obviously had the skills of a semi-pro.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Well, perhaps... He did it on purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong looked at her sister&#x2019;s boyfriend.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There...&#xA0;</span><span style="">He rose slowly and bowed his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello. Nice to meet you. I am Seo Tae-hyuk who is studying with Class President.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike what Eun-jeong knew, his face and gestures were calm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he obviously...!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and raised an index finger to his mouth and quietly said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a secret. Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cheol-su...!&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong couldn&#x2019;t understand why that fearsome monster was in her house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ah, yes. He said that he came because of her little sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong sat down with a frightened face and started to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry...! I was wrong... Please forgive me...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused father of the two sisters said, </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...E-Eun-jeong. Father has already forgiven you, so you don&#x2019;t need to apologize. Yes? Don&#x2019;t do this in front of a guest. Isn&#x2019;t our Eun-jeong good?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, that&apos;s not it...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Eun-jeong was forgiven by her father.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a happy ending on the first day of the new year.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
