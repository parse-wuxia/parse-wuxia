<p><span style="">Chapter 122 - Divergent #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Kataros, who was sitting in his office at the castle, felt cold and rose from his seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On top of that, his shoulders were covered with white snow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jeez, the windows are open.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Snow and icy winds had entered through a small gap in the window.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The candle on the table shook and was instantly extinguished.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he was looking at himself as a bitter smile appeared on Kataros&#x2019; face.</span></p><p><span style="">He was the godfather of the Red Mafia Ivankov family.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, several failures meant that the eyes of the other bosses were on him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Right now, Kataros only remained as a boss due to the support of his right arm, Semon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to find something that would allow him to come back from behind.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, there was a knock on the door.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Boss. It is Semon. I brought what we spoke about.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon walked into the office and spoke like a butler.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The weather is quite cold. If you keep the windows open like this then you will catch a cold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros had long silver hair that completely covered his shoulders.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he felt a cold touch at his fingertips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems to me like the wind is coming from South Korea. I want to see what it feels like.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon answered with a big sigh,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Open your eyes. Stay still for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like I am still a young child in your eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But Kataros closed his eyes and let Semon work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Semon brushed at Kataros&#x2019; shoulders with careful gestures, like he was handling a delicate piece of glass.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he placed the materials he was holding on Kataros&#x2019; table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hum hum. By the way, it seems like Boss really likes Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Being Arsene Lupin was the dream of any child who watched him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Did I hear that correctly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s a joke. I just feel like I need this person&#x2019;s abilities in order to survive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon looked at his boss with a strangely grim expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In his eyes, the boss&#x2019;s dazzling silver hair shone.</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros started to read the neatly arranged data about Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mister did a better job than I thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon nodded as he heard the name of the spy he planted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting Mister to become so close to Phantom. It seems to truly be god&#x2019;s work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom. The more I see, the more I like. He really has unpredictable abilities. He managed to defeat the fully armed Big Brother. He even used the press and government freely. In addition, he has a strange magic that can change his voice and face. It is like he is the second coming of Lupin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon smiled and remained silent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. By the way, look at this. Phantom was also involved in the collapse of Blue Dragon Prison?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a well-known place for Kataros.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was one of the four prisons modelled after Alcatraz.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Inside the Blue Dragon Prison, the Japanese Yakuza and Chinese Triads were each working in their own interests.</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros looked at Semon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Semon was looking back like a parent gazing at their child.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much information does Mister have?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is watching out for the mafia in South Korea. It will be easy for him to act as a spy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What would you like to do? Should I instruct him to move more aggressively?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, just watch him for now. There is a possibility that Phantom will confront the Triads and the Yakuza.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I know what Boss wants.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It means we might be able to cooperate to face the same enemy. Tell Mister to keep an eye on Phantom. If Phantom is the enemy of the Yakuza and Triads...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros looked down at the photograph of Phantom with grey eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I will go and meet him directly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">He had been thinking about the proposal since the Christmas he spent with her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk went on a date and then suddenly volunteered at the orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even the good girls in dramas would frown at that.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ha-ran smiled brightly and thanked him for introducing her to the cute children.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, Cho Kang-suk once again set his heart on Seo Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the direct decision was made after the Park Sung-yul case.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah Hyung! It isn&#x2019;t ready yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh. Originally beef should be cooked like the meat is alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t just eat meat, have vegetables as well. Oh, Kang-suk shouldn&#x2019;t just watch. I&#x2019;ll make a wrap for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran started putting all sorts of delicious things into a lettuce wrap.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The finished product was larger than expected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the size of Kang-suk&#x2019;s fist, a size that was impossible to eat in one bite.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Kang-suk wasn&#x2019;t the type of person to give up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After clearing his throat a few times, he opened his mouth widely and put the lettuce wrap in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He leisurely tasted it and said it was delicious.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Tae-min started clapping from where they were sitting on the sidelines.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah. He ate it in one bite.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is almost an art form.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Ha-ran&#x2019;s eyes widened and she said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo, I&#x2019;m sorry. I made it too big.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After that small incident, Tae-min started to grill the meat with tongs and scissors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A few pieces of meat were on top of the hotplate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had already eaten meat, rice and cold noodles so their chopsticks were slowing down.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&#x2019;t the end for Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He spoke with a dignified tone, like a commanding officer speaking to soldiers who were about to go fight.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We can&#x2019;t eat this much at our age. This won&#x2019;t work. Auntie! Add four more servings here please!</span></p><p><span style="">Both Tae-hyuk and Tae-min raised their thumbs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was always more room in their stomachs for meat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The eyes of the warriors started to burn at the appearance of a new enemy.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh! Game two!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I loosened my belt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk made a fist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s eat until we die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the four people ate 12 servings of beef and literally collapsed to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even breathing was painful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh... I think I will die...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think I can eat anything for the next week...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran, the only one who seemed fine, held out a tray with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Does anyone want to drink tea for dessert?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Tae-min, who were lying on the floor, lifted their tremblings hands.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk smiled happily at the sight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His job wasn&#x2019;t just catching criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For a while, he had forgotten the reason why he had become a police officer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ha-ran.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I love you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s face turned bright red.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oh my... Kang-suk really... It is foul to say it in a place like this!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to protect that smile.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are they tired since it has been a long time? It will take some time to get home. They are already sleeping.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran and Tae-min were sleeping in the back seats.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled from where he was sitting in the passenger seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So where do you plan to do the ceremony? You know that you can&#x2019;t do it by yourself like this time right? I&#x2019;m looking forward to helping you organize the best wedding.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm hmm. Was it better to make it a bit more romantic?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah. Did you only realize that now? Aigoo... I really want to ask you again to cancel it. Well, Noona didn&#x2019;t dislike it so I will let it go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk cried out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t act like a mother-in-law!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! Kang-suk hyung! Focus on driving! There might be an accident.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I only just bought a car but I have driven many police cars.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk watched Kang-suk bang his chest with a confident expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the road, the only light source was from the car&#x2019;s headlights.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked out the windshield and thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t been revealed what fate had changed due to Kang-suk&#x2019;s decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I need to find out why.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In the future, he would need to gain a large amount of affinity points to fight the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he had to figure out the exact mechanism behind gaining them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First of all, I should compare the blacklist members with different tendencies. Then should I catch another person to check their affinity points?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had fought the killer Big Brother, sent by the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used Damage to Both Sides to destroy him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk was able to gain eight affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that he could gain points by catching criminals that weren&#x2019;t on the blacklist.</span></p><p><span style="">Apart from Big Brother, Tae-hyuk had dealt with a considerable number of criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, not all cases gave him affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wondered what the difference was.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The most likely hypothesis is that I can acquire affinity points by changing the determined destiny.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew a criminal that he could use to confirm this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Cho Min-hyuk!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was the leader of the pseudo-religion, Sun, and had thousands of followers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he destroyed the religion then thousands of fates would surely change.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it wouldn&#x2019;t be an easy fight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the first place, the scale itself was different compared to what he had done so far.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The leader committed all sorts of illegal acts but was never judged by the law.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Nevertheless, Tae-hyuk had knowledge about Sun due to one of the top executives being imprisoned in Blue Dragon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He brainwashed his followers and tried to sell them abroad.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used an incense that made the people light-headed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Perhaps...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had encountered something similar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the hypnotic incense used by Choi Sung-yeol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before leaving Blue Dragon Prison, Tae-hyuk had gained all sorts of information from Choi Sung-yeol.</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza were behind the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then there were those who would use the hypnotic incense beside Choi Sung-yeol.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;Maybe the Yakuza is behind Sun.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The chance of that wasn&#x2019;t zero.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked wickedly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Whether he liked it or not, he had to fight the mafia in order to win this game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he could gain points from changing fate then he would gain an enormous number by smashing Sun.</span></p><p><span style="">Furthermore, the opponent was the criminal on the blacklist that was most likely to be associated with the mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I need to smash them even more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to fight them right after obtaining the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, now he was a Noble with various crime skills and connections.</span></p><p><span style="">Sun, a religious cult with thousands of followers in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s next target.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
