<p><span style="">Chapter 151 - Time to Clean Up #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bomber, you have worked hard in the meantime. Now I will do as I promised.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber didn&apos;t say anything for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to take direct revenge on the Taesung Group, who drove his family to their deaths.</span></p><p><span style="">-....</span><i><span style="">At first, I thought they would be judged if I revealed what they did.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">However, I was mistaken.</span></i></p><p><span style="">At first, there were a lot of people who blamed the Taesung Group for concealing the events that occurred at their laboratory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the Internet, a boycott against products made by the Taesung Group were launched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The stock prices fell everyday, leading to losses of billions of won.</span></p><p><span style="">The person who was responsible was arrested and everything seemed to be going as the Bomber planned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the Bomber was unaware of how much the big corporations dominated the Korean system.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. One researcher committed suicide and claimed all responsibility. It fizzled out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber said,</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">In less than 10 minutes, the headlines were filled with entertainment scandals.</span></i> <i><span style="">I didn&#x2019;t think that such a large incident could be buried so easily.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is possible in South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Huhu...is that so?</span></i> <i><span style="">That is why we have to do such things in South Korea.</span></i></p><p><span style="">He heard a clicking sound over the receiver.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was the Bomber touching his bombs?</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber acted as if his emotions had been removed ever since he escaped from prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was only when he talked about the Taesung Group that he felt like a living human.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was literally a bomb that lived for destroying his target.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I wanted to make sure of something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-...</span><i><span style="">What is it?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is the revenge you want?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a question that implied various things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was simple if he just wanted revenge on the one who killed his family.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk just needed to find the person who injected them directly with the virus.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the Bomber wouldn&#x2019;t be satisfied with just that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The target of the Bomber was the Taesung Group itself that ran the research institutes.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">First of all...I want to know who ordered the experiment on my wife and daughter.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I also want to smash the Taesung Group, the group that made it possible.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t hard either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Bomber&#x2019;s voice started shaking,</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Is it possible?</span></i> <i><span style="">No matter how great you are, Phantom will need to fight a big corporation by yourself.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu, don&#x2019;t worry about it. I will fulfill my promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to try the abilities that he had gained after upgraded himself to a King.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was good for him as well.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Yes, I understand.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk instructed the Bomber to prepare for the fight against the research institutes.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">If he watched any TV program then he would see advertisements from the Taesung Group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The influence of the Taesung Group on the mass media was amazing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, one or two people dying doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled the chairman of the Taesung Group, Song Won-jin.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk first saw him in the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He sat in the best seat with a lion mask on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After that, the Bomber incident happened and he went through questioning before returning to the Taesung Group.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had clicked his tongue at the news.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Taesung research institute event is kind of understandable. But how did he get out of the Death Circus case? It is impossible unless he has connections with the prosecutors...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew that the Yakuza&#x2019;s support was behind the Taesung Group.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Wait a minute. This means...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk combined his future knowledge and the information he had obtained as Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to come up with a shocking fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The hands of the Yakuza might&#x2019;ve reached the prosecutors as well. It is a high-ranking person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he investigated then more details would emerge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, he knew what had to be done from now on.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, gather information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The goal was the Taesung Institute of Physics and Chemistry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was one of the few natural sciences institutes in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Physics, engineering, chemistry, computational science, biology and medical science were closely studied there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, it was inside the Taesung Research Complex, but it was moved after the incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I should go into the lion&#x2019;s den to catch the lion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a place he could easily enter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just like fighting against the mafia, it was impossible to shatter all of the research institutes belonging to the Taesung Group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had only been able to drive the mafia away from South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I roam around the lair as a fox, then I can escape the lion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eh? If it was a lion then he knew someone similar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk suddenly came up with a very good plan before heading to Taesung Chemical&#x2019;s headquarters.</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike the institute, it was easy to reach by taxi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He headed to a nearby restroom and pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then shall I test the power of Transformation?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the new skill he learnt after upgrading to a King.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The spy shouldn&#x2019;t be a good-looking woman.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He ended up becoming a new reporter who was in her early 20s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had bright blonde hair that was cut short, and makeup that felt unfamiliar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The clothes she wore were the same, so the leather jacket was baggy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I forgot to change clothes. Ahaha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His voice was perfectly changed into a woman&#x2019;s, so there was no need to use Voice Modulation separately.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used Counterfeit to change his leather jacket and jeans into a neat ladies&#x2019; suit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pass around his neck allowed him access to large companies.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked in the mirror and tried to make an expression that was as innocent as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know where to go but he decided to try it first.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Like all large companies, the entire high-rise building was the headquarters of Taesung Chemicals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he opened the door and approached the desk, the receptionist bowed politely and greeted him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello? What can I help you with today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! I-Is it 2 o&#x2019;clock right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m glad. Today I have an interview with an executive... However, I mistook the time so I left late and had to hurry...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is that so? You went through a lot of trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk purposely made his hair disheveled and clothes messy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He perfectly looked like a person who was in a hurry because they were running late.</span></p><p><span style="">The receptionist said with a soft smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but could you please show me your pass?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised the pass hanging around his neck.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On it was the name of a person who frequently wrote articles on Taesung Chemicals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to register her appearance on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally a bounteous tree.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is verified. Have you come here before? You have an ID registered.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-It looks like I did...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who did you come to see? Did you make an appointment in advance?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made the most pathetic expression he could and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That...S-Sunbae...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t panic. Can you tell me who it was?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The receptionist looked at the new reporter with sympathy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How was she supposed to interview someone like this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was reminded of her new employee days.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes...!</span></p><p><span style="">Although they weren&#x2019;t in the same field, she decided to be kind to the rookie.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-An interview with C-Chairman Song Won-jin...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;With the boss?! T-that is impossible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The receptionist&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That interview was too big to be done by a new reporter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even she had never seen the boss before.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... That is right...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then I&#x2019;ll call his secretary and check it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The receptionist was troubled for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Taesung Chemicals&#x2019; chairman, Song Won-jin, was lying low since being involved in a scandal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only ones who dealt with him were a few direct subordinates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, most interview requests were rejected, yet a woman who was a new reporter was looking for the chairman.</span></p><p><span style="">The receptionist would&#x2019;ve sent her away directly, but that seemed too harsh.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be turned down, but wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice to show that an attempt was made?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reception pressed the intercom to the secretary then spoke in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Chief Soo-hee. Perhaps...an interview...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then a loud sound was heard over the receiver.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-What?</span></i> <i><span style="">I told you not to contact me regarding anything like that!</span></i> <i><span style="">And a new journalist?</span></i> <i><span style="">Send them back to the station</span></i><span style="">!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... I-I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;m hanging up.</span></i> <i><span style="">In addition, I will contact HR about this so reflect on your actions.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the most that the receptionist could do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. The chairman isn&#x2019;t seeing anyone right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Did you get into trouble because of me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you hear? Ahaha! It is okay. It is originally like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes flashed as he gazed at the receptionist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had deliberately picked someone who was kind and gentle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She acted as he expected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk left the place after completing his conversation with the friendly receptionist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is the best way to gain information.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He pretended to be a new journalist so people were vigilant against him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never expected to meet Chairman Song Won-jin in the first place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was good enough.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I never thought it would be easy to see Chairman Song Won-jin.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk immediately triggered the Spying skill after he started talking to the receptionist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After upgrading to a King, he was able to get much more detailed information from Spying.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;For example, where the receiver is connected to.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He could trace calls without using any equipment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he was a Noble, skills could be raised by consuming affinity points or satisfying certain conditions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, when he upgraded to a King, the level of all of his crime skills had risen.</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s psychological state became more like a psychopathic criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But a little thing like that didn&#x2019;t matter right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The place where the voice is coming from is the 7th floor of this building. I now know the whereabouts of Chairman Song Won-jin.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He took the elevator while pretending to go to the bathroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he pushed the button to the 6th floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That floor seems to be VIPs only.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He used &#x2018;Spying&#x2019; and &#x2018;Forgery&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A blueprint of the whole building appeared before him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a red dot indicating the room where the secretary was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he was looking at the world map of a FPS game.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no more need to draw it on paper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But as he looked at the map, letters appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">[Threaten the guards to find out Song Won-jin&#x2019;s whereabouts!]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is the same as a game. Is this a new ability that was obtained after becoming a King?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even now, the Demon Revealing Mirror. was in one of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s pockets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the first place, it was something that he couldn&#x2019;t throw away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now it was giving a command.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, isn&#x2019;t this feature convenient?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The map displayed the people wandering around.</span></p><p><span style="">He seemed like he could reach the security office without being noticed by anyone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk confidently walked down the corridor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no need to act covertly and arouse suspicions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhuhu, I&#x2019;ve arrived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He met a few people on the way but he walked naturally past them.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He still looked like the reporter.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is good, but it is better to change from here onwards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he turned off Counterfeit and his clothes returned to normal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He moved his finger and easily turned into the Bomber, Kim Tae-sung.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Inside the jacket was his favorite mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the now familiar Phantom mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. This isn&#x2019;t the time for Phantom to go out so I shouldn&#x2019;t use it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shattering a large corporation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In this case, he needed to be someone other than Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used Counterfeit on the opera mask and turned it into a skull mask that covered his entire face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;From now on, I am the Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
