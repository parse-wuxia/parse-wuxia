<p><span style="">Chapter 56: Black Sheep Exodus #3 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god... A plan to lead all the participants and escape is unprecedented. Have we ever had such a participant? If this happens then it really will be like the miracle of Moses!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How many participants are remaining now?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;17 except for the wolves...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-If the plan is successful then that&#x2019;s a huge sum of 3.4 billion won!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The party guests had already heard of the Black Sheep Exodus plan.</span></p><p><span style="">Sheep hunting wolves.</span></p><p><span style="">That was surprising enough.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The black sheep started leading other sheep to escape the circus.</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the guests listening to the plan thought it was a carefully planned fraud.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He and a handful of other people were deceiving the participants in order to survive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If successful, it would be the best scam since the Death Circus started.</span></p><p><span style="">That alone made the masked people watch the monitor while sweating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the charm of an addictive show.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This show alone is worth a few billion. Immediately scout Lee Cheol-su as a wolf!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were comments about wanting Cheol-su to appear as a wolf in the next Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time Cheol-su solved a puzzle, there would be a loud sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Hoo! H-He perfectly cleared the Puzzle House!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That is ridiculous! How can he solve it so quickly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I already missed nine questions...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The extraordinary scenes continued.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The black sheep solved all of the problems and received the prize money with a casual expression.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">How is it?</span></i> <i><span style="">Simple right?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tremendous cheering shook the ballroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere was like the Korean national soccer team scoring a goal from behind!</span></p><p><span style="">The only one who remained silent was the lion mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was quietly waiting for his sources to figure out Lee Cheol-su&#x2019;s identity.</span></p><p><span style="">A clear photo of his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The age was in the mid-20s or so.</span></p><p><span style="">If they had this information, then all the details could be discovered in 30 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pressed the call button as the call he had been waiting for arrived.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is me. So what did you find out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">That...</span></i> <i><span style="">So.</span></i> <i><span style="">No matter where I looked, there was no information matching the person you described.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? You can&#x2019;t even find him with that much money! You incompetent bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I-I&#x2019;m really sorry.</span></i> <i><span style="">I thought his name might be an alias, so I tried searching the resident registration cards of adult males.</span></i> <i><span style="">Indeed...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then he would be a ghost!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I-I am ashamed of myself.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The lion mask roughly hung up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he couldn&#x2019;t identify the black sheep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The lion mask looked at the image of Seo Tae-hyuk on the monitor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He murmured in a trembling voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You... Who the hell are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he shut up again.</span></p><p><span style="">There was another person on the monitor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the woman called An Eun-jeong who had been attached to the black sheep from the beginning of </span><span style="">the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">She read the note from the black sheep and suddenly screamed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, they couldn&#x2019;t see the contents because of the camera angles.</span></p><p><span style="">The masked people clamoured loudly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m feeling dizzy. Please show the note.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. Call the Puzzle House manager right now to check it out!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unexpected developments followed.</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask swallowed his saliva and stared at the monitor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was curious about the following contents so he couldn&#x2019;t afford to think of anything else.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tears flowed from An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her heart throbbed, and it felt like her heart had been cut into twelve pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, she recalled a sentence that Cheol-su wrote.</span></p><p><i><span style="">&#x2018;Noona should know the pain that they experienced.&#x2019;</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A moan emerged from An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">She betrayed her family and ran away before falling into the corruption of a multilevel company.</span></p><p><span style="">Father...&#xA0;</span><span style="">And her little sister...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did they feel like this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the feeling of being betrayed by someone that was completely trusted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Daddy... I&#x2019;m sorry... Sorry Eun-young... Mama... I can&#x2019;t return...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She would soon die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guillotine would cut off her limbs and she would die an awful death.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, the appearance of her family emerged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The appearance that she had hated so much came to Eun-jeong&#x2019;s mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If only she was given one more chance...&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wanted to apologize to them for her mistakes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sob sob...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong slowly started to prepare her mind for death.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the bearded manager of the Puzzle House approached Eun-jeong and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you have a fight with your lover? By the way... The man who just left told me to say something to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Uwaah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what the situation is, so I will just say it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He threw some words at her before returning to his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That note is a joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Sob... Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She was so amazed that the flowing tears dried in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What&#x2019;s up with that look? I received money so I just did what I was told.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bearded man started to count the money that he had received from someone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong wiped her eyes with her sleeves and looked out of the Puzzle House.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She saw Cheol-su smiling innocently at her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He waved his hand when he caught her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Eun-jeong couldn&#x2019;t resist screaming.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, you jerk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She wanted to do something truly unpleasant right now but she couldn&#x2019;t.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How can t-t-this person d-do this!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong was able to solve all the puzzles and earned 50 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as she came out, she demanded answers from Tae-hyuk who was waiting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wasn&#x2019;t it a moderately tense attraction? Now, don&#x2019;t betray the faith of your family again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong bit her lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was terrible enough to make her want to beat him up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But thanks to him, she was alive like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Eun-jeong agreed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you betray them once more then you will see me again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hik!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s face turned white.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Meet this demon again?&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t want to imagine such a terrible thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Come now. There is no time. The next person should enter. I will tell them the answers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although there was some trouble, An Eun-jeong answered all of the puzzles and earned the prize money safely due to Tae-hyuk telling her the answers from outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The participants who saw it raised their hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, me first!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put them in a suitable order and smiled as he nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Like this, hasn&#x2019;t Eun-jeong noona&#x2019;s spirit become determined?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She obviously wouldn&#x2019;t enter a pyramid scheme again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The plan to mentally fix An Eun-young and Seo Ha-ran ended safely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now the only thing left was to thoroughly defeat the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;But I never thought it would be helpful to memorize all these problems.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a total of 150 problems in the Puzzle House.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And the questions were random.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to find all the problems, a person would have to participate at least five times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the worst case, they might challenge the Puzzle House 21 times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible for all the participants to challenge the Puzzle House to figure out the questions.</span></p><p><span style="">But it was possible for Tae-hyuk who had memories of the future.</span></p><p><span style="">He was trapped in a prison cell for 10 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t pleasant memories.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had knowledge of many crimes thanks to that experience.</span></p><p><span style="">Nights in the prison were long.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prisoners who didn&#x2019;t fall asleep easily would quiz each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The problems at that time were the ones written by the Producer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk heard prisoners solving the problems every night.</span></p><p><span style="">He became really tired of hearing it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to the extent that he knew the answer just by hearing the first word of the question.</span></p><p><span style="">Due to that, this ridiculous winning strategy was possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now it is time to catch a wolf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-We really can get out of here alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is all thanks to Boss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An additional 10 people cleared the Puzzle House for a total of 500 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The time remaining was approximately 150 minutes. They would be able to collect the target amount before closing.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Of course, I don&#x2019;t have to do anything.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The wolf laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Their job was simple: Interfere in the work of the black sheep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they could get out of here. They could obtain the bounty.</span></p><p><span style="">The wolf&#x2019;s plan was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The total amount of money that the group of sheep had was 900 million, with most of the money belonging to the black sheep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the next three payment fees meant that more than half of that money would be gone.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the number of people who could get out would be reduced to two.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other words, if they didn&#x2019;t make money anymoren then the sheep would fight against each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The method is really simple. There can only be one person in the Puzzle House. That is the rule. Once inside, I won&#x2019;t answer the questions for as long as possible so they won&#x2019;t be able to proceed. In other words, I will waste all the time.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a simply way to destroy the sheep.</span></p><p><span style="">The wolf smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was their turn to enter the Puzzle House.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You didn&#x2019;t notice my identity even at the end. Yes. This is my victory!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The wolf slowly walked towards the puzzle house.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait a minute.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk blocked the person about to enter the Puzzle House.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I think we should change the order of entry. You can enter after everybody has already obtained 200 million won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Why all of a sudden? Didn&#x2019;t you set the order beforehand?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly took a step forward and whispered in the other person&#x2019;s ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Because you are a wolf.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you talking about? I&#x2019;m not a wolf. You should know. The people gathered in Group A absolutely can&#x2019;t be wolves!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The only woman belonging to Group A, Jeon Mina, shouted with confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you aren&#x2019;t a wolf, then it doesn&#x2019;t really matter. The order is just changed. There will only be a little bit of boredom from waiting. In the meantime, you can talk to Eun-jeong noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&#x2019;m innocent! I believed in Boss from the beginning! Ah, yes. Kim Jun-tae! He is the wolf. It is obvious no matter how you look at it. If Boss asks for everyone&#x2019;s opinion...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ignored Mina and called Yoon Jong-hyun over.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ajusshi. Could you capture this person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is Mina really the wolf?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You will know by the end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun picked up the rope and started to bind Mina&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mina shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! It hurts! A little softer! So unfair! I&#x2019;m really not the wolf!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina was on the verge of tears.</span></p><p><span style="">A few participants who saw her were swayed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think she is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why is Boss being like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have to believe in Boss. Let&#x2019;s watch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was immovable as he laughed at Mina.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mina. No, Wolf. The plan for wasting time in the Puzzle House is now useless. It is your defeat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina glared at Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then all of a sudden, she started laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahhahahaha! &#x2026;How did you know? My acting was perfect.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina&#x2019;s atmosphere instantly changed, making her seem like a different person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The participants watching got goose bumps.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised two fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You made two mistakes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mistakes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is simple. The other participants are looking for some way to live. But the wolf will try to kill others. </span><span style="">I clearly remember that you were trying to kill Kim Jun-tae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoock...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina gave a strange groan.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And in a situation like this, it&#x2019;s normal to doubt the other person. A person who blindly believes in me is rather suspicious. Kid. Practice acting some more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stroked Mina&#x2019;s head like she was a cute baby.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now. Come. The interference has disappeared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The fourth wolf, Mina, was captured.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The last of the remaining wolves, the fifth one had disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">There were no longer any wolves&#xA0;in this group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded slightly at everyone gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then we will take the money and smash the Death Circus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Black Sheep Exodus plan had reached its final phase.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
