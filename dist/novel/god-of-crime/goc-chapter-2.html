It was the same as fox hunting, if a fox&#x2019;s cave was lit on fire, then it would fall prey to the hunters waiting outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If there was a definite hideout, it was better to keep hiding there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;The place where Yoo Cheol-ho is located is 20 bus stops away.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A serial killer that had the whole nation in an uproar was in such close proximity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk pulled out the wallet from his pocket and checked its contents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Um. It have about 3,000 won in total.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was said that a man should always have 3,000 won on him. He had no idea that would be true.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was only enough for a round-trip bus fare. Furthermore, if he used up all of it then he would have to starve for lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;If I had known that then I would have eaten more for breakfast.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He hadn&#x2019;t even eaten half a bowl of stew due to thinking about Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was like in the military or the prison. It was an unspoken law that those who left food behind would soon regret it. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Damn. This is just like a real criminal.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was within walking distance but Tae-hyuk decided to take the bus. It was noticeable if a student wearing a uniform was walking the streets during class time. Due to his delinquent looks, he was often picked up by police officers on patrol and lectured.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Every time Ha-ran was contacted, he would have to see her in tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Indeed, I should take the bus.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What did he want to do when he met Yoo Cheol-ho?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind became complicated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">What if Yoo Cheol-ho was really at the location where he was going now? Then it would be proof that what he thought was a dream actually wasn&#x2019;t.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Would he really go to jail in five years after being falsely accused?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As a result those events, his older sister Seo Ha-ran and younger brother Seo Tae-min would be ruined.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Fuck. It is like hearing that I have a terminal illness...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, it was better to know and be prepared than to be ignorant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk got on the bus towards his destination.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He pulled his baseball cap deep over his face, just in case he saw a face that he knew.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Um. It is past the time to go to work so there aren&#x2019;t many people on the bus.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was only an old lady and a man with a baseball cap positioned like Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had bumped into the man when he got on the bus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But there was something suspicious about him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;It is so empty in here, so why is he sitting next to someone?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk, who had sat in an empty seat, turned and closely observed the two of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Brr!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a vibration from between his crotch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk looked around with surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Fuck... If anyone saw that then they would think I was a pervert.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was something in the pocket of his school uniform that was vibrating.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Uh, is it a mirror? Why is it in the pocket of my uniform?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the mirror that he used to look at himself this morning. The demon carved on the outside still looked really ominous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk squinted and looked at the mirror..</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His face was reflected but there were still some strange letters written.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Crime Skill: Robbery has been acquired.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-You can acquire one random item when bumping against another person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-The probability of success depends on your dexterity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The letters came and then disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&apos;s mouth trembled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;What is this...?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At the same time, new letters emerged above his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Seo Tae-hyuk]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Title: God of Crime</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Rating: Commoner (Lacking conditions for upgrade)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Skills Possessed: Robbery (Lv 1)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Did I learn the Robbery skill just now? Why? WHY?!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk realized that the demon mirror wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary item.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the first place, he had clearly left this on Tae-min&#x2019;s desk, yet it somehow ended up in his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He thought that the demon looked like a true dick. A really dick-like thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyway, if the words on the demon mirror were true, then he had just learnt a crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk looked around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It wasn&#x2019;t difficult to find the reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;If there is a result, then there needs to be a cause.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s arrival on the bus, the old lady started to snore as she dozed off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The man sitting next to her then revealed his true colours.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Pickpocket!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The man used careful hand techniques to prevent the old lady from waking up. He easily opened the locked handbag using a razor, and all he took out was a wallet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If Tae-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t known that something was going to happen beforehand, then he would have thought the man&#x2019;s body had moved because the bus was shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That&#x2019;s how perfect the man&#x2019;s skill was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk wouldn&#x2019;t have noticed if he hadn&#x2019;t seen the word &#x2018;robbery&#x2019; on the demon mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;What on earth is this mirror?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk chewed on his lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Was it truly a mirror that had a demon dwelling inside it?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The pickpocket tried to get off the bus before Tae-hyuk could calm his confused mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Duk!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The pickpocket was rushing like he could feel a gaze on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then Tae-hyeok&apos;s body was lightly bumped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Once again, the demon mirror vibrated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Brr!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk made a crazy expression and looked at the mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-You have succeeded in stealing the opponent&#x2019;s belongings! &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The pickpocket had already escaped the bus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Robbery?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">According to the message in the mirror, he had stolen something from the pickpocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I should check to see what I stole first.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk searched through his pockets before a long wallet that he hadn&#x2019;t seen before emerged.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Oh my god!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was as he had thought. The pickpocket had stolen the old lady&#x2019;s wallet then it was stolen again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In this situation, the one accused of being the criminal would be him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk hurriedly got off the bus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The the old lady&#x2019;s scream rang through the bus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Omo! My wallet is gone!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shook.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was no time. Tae-hyuk ran through the alleys.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Crazy...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">A pickpocket stole the old lady&apos;s wallet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">And the pickpocket had the wallet stolen by Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If Tae-hyuk had been a little late getting off the bus then he would have been arrested by the police officer on duty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;What? God of Crime? Trying to make a good person a criminal!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk angrily threw the demon mirror with all his strength towards the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Jjeok!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Wah...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Rather than the fragile mirror breaking, the cement ground was the one that cracked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This time he stepped on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Uaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It hurt like he had kicked a stone pillar. Tae-hyuk spat out curses and threw the demon mirror into a trash bin.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He then turned his body and left this place.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">* &#xA0; &#xA0; * &#xA0; &#xA0; *</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk was worried about what to do with the old lady&#x2019;s wallet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It seemed like he was becoming a criminal without his consent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Just like those guys.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In his dream, Tae-hyuk had been imprisoned for 10 years. Unless he was in solitary confinement, it was impossible not to meet other criminals.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There were even those criminals convicted of atrocities.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yoo Cheol-ho was one of those people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">They were monsters in a human guise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Now, he wasn&#x2019;t too sure that it was a dream. At any rate, he was a falsely accused death row inmate in his dream.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">For 10 years, he had struggled to escape from that place. It had been a really painful, long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Would it have been easier if he knew that he had been postponing death for 10 years?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">So if he became a criminal here, it would be like denying his very existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I need to find its owner&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">But how?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He could go to the police station and give them the wallet. They would thank him for surrendering, and then they would handcuff him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Well. It is best to just put it in the mailbox.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Inside the wallet were 20 checkbooks worth 100,000 won each and ten 50,000 won bills. The total was 2.5 million won.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was also identification. He would definitely put it in the mailbox that belonged to the owner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;She is richer than I thought.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His heart shook at the tidy sum. It was enough to buy some new clothes for his troubled sister.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;...Seo Tae-hyuk. What are you thinking? I don&#x2019;t think that Noona would like that.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk pulled a 50,000 won bill from the wallet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was lost property, so to speak. If he returned it to the owner, then 10% was his.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then he put the wallet in the mailbox.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;I can buy&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline"><a href="www.google.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit">samgyeopsal</a></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;and grill it with Noona.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He thought as he placed the money in his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He froze in shock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Crazy...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the demon mirror that he had obviously tossed in the bin.</span></p><hr><p></p></div><p></p>
