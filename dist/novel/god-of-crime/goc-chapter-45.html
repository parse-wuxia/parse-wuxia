<p><span style="">Chapter 45: The Family&#x2019;s Condition #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took out the Demon Revealing Mirror in front of Big Mama&#x2019;s pawn shop.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt tense whenever he had to meet her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk checked his abilities every time he came here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to know what he could do, and where it was possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That way, he would have confidence while dealing with Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">After the Rosario incident, their relationship had become a type of partnership.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he always had to be ready for any type of deception coming his way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then first, the crime skills...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He tapped on the Demon Revealing Mirror and pulled up his current learned crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Robbery, Spying, Voice Modulation, Forgery, Gambling, and Violence - all of these made up for a total of six skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also had 10 affinity points that could be used to strengthen those skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every one of them had a type of charm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;d like to raise them but I&#x2019;ll save them, since I don&#x2019;t know what I will need.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Next, he confirmed his stats.</span></p><p><span style="">Stats: Stamina (59), Intelligence (47), Agility (24), Dexterity (39)</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had used the Forgery skill quite a lot during the Hippo case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also consumed an affinity point for a temporary special ability.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His dexterity had gone up by five points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Three of his stats were close to the condition necessary for the upgrade.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the near future, he would be able to reach the second rank &#x2018;Noble.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a Commoner, there were a lot of restraints on his abilities, so he wanted to reach the next rank sooner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is difficult with the abilities I currently possess&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Last night, Tae-hyuk had fought against the Hippo, and had to mobilize everything he had in order to win.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Hippo was a crazy guy, but just based on strength, he wasn&#x2019;t the strongest on the blacklist.</span></p><p><span style="">Among the criminals he would meet in the future, there were those with superhuman abilities, or those who used bombs to kill hundreds of people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, a pseudo-cult with thousands of followers.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk would soon meet them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Prior to that, he should at least upgrade to the Noble rank.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know how much stronger a Noble is, but it should still be better than my current rank.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he had met six people on the blacklist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Oddly, the counter raised, despite not causing Moonlight Flower and Big Mama to be arrested.</span></p><p><span style="">In the case of the Moonlight Flower, he caught Kim Sang-hyun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And after receiving Rosario from Big Mama, a notification had popped up on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like catching them wasn&#x2019;t the only condition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyway, there are 14 people left!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">To do that, he needed to maintain his close relationship with Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyway, the important thing was to find out about Park Jung-hwan&#x2019;s death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Mama raised dozens of snakes in her belly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was dangerous to believe everything she said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026; Anyway, today I should clearly find out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk firmly opened the door of the pawn shop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo. It is Tae-hyuk. Did you come for the part time job?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama looked up and asked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&apos;s mouth twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Saying this after making such a bombshell announcement... Ohh. Indeed, a scary woman!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s continue the conversation from yesterday. I want you to give me the proper information about Park Jung-hwan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was reasonable to ask after paying the information fee.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohoho. Of course I&#x2019;ve prepared it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama went into a room in her store and came out with a paper envelope.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Read it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk accepted it and confirmed the contents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It contained everything about Park Jung-hwan: Where he was born, what school he went to, his school marks, the names of his close friends, and even the university clubs that he joined.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was miraculous how Big Mama managed to investigate so much.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a bit later than promised. I&#x2019;m sorry so I arranged the important parts as a special service. Do you want to hear it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Park Jung-hwan is a native of Gangwon-do. A so-called self made person. As you can see from the materials I prepared, he studied well and exercised hard. He was popular due to his bright personality. This style is called...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mother&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s son?&#x201D; (<a href="en.wikipedia.org">Wiki link</a>&#xA0;explanation)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He is literally the perfect image of that type. However, Park Jung-hwan had one unusual characteristic. Listen to this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Inside the envelope was a tape recorder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk put the earphone into his ear and pressed the switch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he heard a conversation over a lot of noise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a conversation between a man with a deep voice and a middle-aged person.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Can you tell me more about the habit of Park Jung-hwan that you mentioned before?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-...</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">Jung-hwan has a habit.</span></i> <i><span style="">It can be called a type of tick?</span></i> <i><span style="">The sides of his mouth twitches when talking...</span></i> <i><span style="">Strangely, the habit doesn&#x2019;t happen on test days or election days.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then the next day, it will occur several times in one minute...</span></i></p><p><span style="">Big Mama said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Listen to the next track.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the tape recorder and fast forwarded through the conversation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time, it was a conversation between the man with the deep voice and an elderly person.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What do you mean, Park Jung-hwan often forgets things?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">So...</span></i> <i><span style="">He is very good at what he does.</span></i> <i><span style="">But after a few days, when I asked him about it again, he completely forgot what happened.</span></i> <i><span style="">He is already forgetful at such a young age.</span></i> <i><span style="">Ah, but his brain is truly great.</span></i> <i><span style="">He never missed being on top at school.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Big Mama after listening.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Those are interviews about Park Jung-hwan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. All of them have known him since high school. I became aware of a shocking fact. That is... Do I need to say it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Two years ago, Park Jung-hwan died.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I learned of this fact by chance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What exactly happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama laughed and raised a finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk. Sorry, but the investigation is up to here. That was exactly 10 million won. If you want to know more, you have to pay extra.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes twitched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to pay more money if he wanted to know?&#xA0;</span><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a three part porn ad, it was too much.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, Tae-hyuk needed to know.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... So how much more do I need to pay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is enough.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama emphasized the one finger that she had raised.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ten million won. Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">He was glad that he had enough money saved.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it was a large amount of money, Big Mama&#x2019;s investigative abilities were worth it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, the future report would certainly be beyond imagination.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You set the limit too low. It is 100 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? 100 million?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Think of it as the information having that much value. Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama had really great insight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The information about Park Jung-hwan had to be obtained, even if he needed to pay a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I&#x2019;ve spent the 100 million I received with Rosario.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. But you made some money from SY.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama knew about it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t do that. It was the money for Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t touch it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You will have to wait a bit for the money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama said with a soft smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If I don&#x2019;t receive the money, then there is no investigation. You should be aware of that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;That old lioness... !&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s expression distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter what, he needed the information about Park Jung-hwan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she might not give all the remaining information even after receiving 100 million.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike the Rosario incident, this time Tae-hyuk was caught on Big Mama&#x2019;s rod.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, Tae-hyuk decided to use a trump card.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... By the way, let me ask you one thing. Is there any counterfeit artwork that you need?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama nodded with a warm smile.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk, who was sitting on the table, had a comfortable expression after a long time.</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked from where he was sitting on the opposite side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been a long time since you came to dinner. Have you missed Noona?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was startled and quickly replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I came to see you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a convinced expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was super busy with an awful case. Somehow it was solved. I have some time to rest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what happened. Well, I&#x2019;m glad that you did well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. In fact, I didn&#x2019;t do anything. It is a little awkward since it somehow became my achievement. Tomorrow, I will formally report to the higher ups.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&apos;s expression was serious.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk felt a knot in his chest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a serial murderer case with two bodies and one victim.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Solving it would be a big achievement for a detective.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kang-suk was trying to kick it away with his own feet.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah, that person! It is the dinner I worked hard to prepare for him. Why is he going to spit it out! He is so upright that he is damaging himself!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was truly a very nice person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, such a person would only receive loss in the world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like Tae-hyuk would have to do some work behind Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke cautiously so that he wouldn&#x2019;t be heard by Ha-ran who was cooking in the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, is now the time? When are you going to ask for a date?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-D-Date! C-Cough! We are just going to play...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to ask for a date until he was an old man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Tae-hyuk acted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona! Kang-suk hyung wants you to hang out with him this weekend!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ya, ya, hey!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was embarrassed but Ha-ran looked at him with an expression of astonishment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she looked at Kang-suk like she was waiting for something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Kang-suk surrendered and asked Ha-ran to go out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, ugh... That&apos;s correct. Ha-ran. Do you have time to go somewhere with me this weekend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran clapped with pleasure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah...! Hang out together? Then I&#x2019;ll prepare a lunch box!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed as he glanced at Ha-ran and Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">It was their first date since first meeting each other three months ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How long would it take for them to become a couple?</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he should help them a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The Hippo incident passed in a flash.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lay down on his desk in the classroom and groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I need to make some money. I also need to support Kang-suk hyung. Ohh. Should I just skip school?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young heard Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s complaints from her seat next to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk... You can&#x2019;t skip school. Go home after school finishes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh. Did you hear?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young said with a serious voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Next week is the final exams. Have you prepared well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared dumbly.</span></p><p><span style="">Recently, he had been so busy that he didn&#x2019;t care about studying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The proof was that his intelligence stat hadn&#x2019;t risen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess not. You did seem strangely busy... If you take the test properly, didn&#x2019;t you say that you would be first in the school?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I can give you special lessons again this time...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was strangely hesitant.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like there was something she wanted to say.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is there something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. Let&apos;s study together like last time. Will you come to my house this weekend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized that An Eun-young was asking for help.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-young. Is something going on? If you don&#x2019;t mind then I am willing to listen to your story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young looked at Tae-hyuk with deeply touched eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she slowly explained the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk... That... You know...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young had an older sister.</span></p><p><span style="">However, she recently got involved in a multi-level scheme and ran away from home.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was troubled after hearing the story.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His head was about to burst just from his own matters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now he needed to help An Eun-young&#x2019;s family matters as well?&#xA0;</span><span style="">What benefits would there be?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">He realized that he always made calculations before moving.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same with Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he used the crime skill, he had the mindset of a criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">He had received enormous help from An Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to her studying skill, he could tremendously increase his intelligence stat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could finally become a model student.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was now asking for help.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How could he refuse just because there were no benefits?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was currently ranked third.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Until he went to university, he needed An Eun-young&#x2019;s studying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he helped her now then he could use her studying skills in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was moving for An Eun-young&#x2019;s studying skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk came to this conclusion and said to An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&apos;t mind then I will help you. Let&#x2019;s talk about the details in your room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes... T-Thank you, Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was sincerely thankful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk felt something like a needle stabbing into his chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then there are three things that need to be solved. I&#x2019;ll be quite busy in the future.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly looked at An Eun-young&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was really glad to see her smiling expression.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
