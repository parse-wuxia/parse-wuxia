<p><span style="">Chapter 24 - &#xA0;Power Deployment</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Two weeks had passed since Seo Tae-hyuk received a month long suspension due to Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s efforts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By the way, it was much better than when he went to school every day.</span></p><p><span style="">In the morning, he did homework and helped Ha-ran with her household chores.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then, he ate lunch and went to work in Big Mama&#x2019;s store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He completed chores according to her instructions until late in the afternoon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the evening, he went to An Eun-young&#x2019;s house to study.</span></p><p><span style="">He was so busy that it felt like there were 36 hours in a day.</span></p><p><span style="">His cognitive abilities increased considerably.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Shall I check it?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk cleaned Big Mama&#x2019;s store, he took out the Demon Revealing Mirror to check his stats.</span></p><p><span style="">Stats: Stamina (61), Intelligence (25), Agility (24), Dexterity (34)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Intelligence has increased by 11. Dexterity by three.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The studying skill was indeed a big help, and Intelligence was the one stat that was rising the quickest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young was amazed by his performance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... By the way, stamina decreased again.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Stamina was steadily decreasing compared to his other stats.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His stats needed 50 points for his ranking to be upgraded to &#x2018;Noble&#x2019;.</span></p><p><span style="">His stamina was overflowing. However, his stomach hurt when he saw that his stats were decreasing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I should exercise.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Studying also needed stamina. It was the real thing.</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to see his stats after obtaining the Spying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew the direct numerical values, so it was more efficient to train his body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk. Please clean this up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aye, aye, Sir!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk removed the dust in the store according to Big Mama&#x2019;s instructions.</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t teach him any skills as soon as he became a disciple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Mama gave Tae-hyuk a job and started forging artworks.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Just watching her is increasing my skill proficiency.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">[You have watched a master craftsman work.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Proficiency will increase rapidly.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Forgery skill 17%]</span></p><p><span style="">The skills that he learned could be elevated by raising the level of proficiency.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Although I can&#x2019;t learn any other skills since there is only one temporary skill window, this isn&#x2019;t that bad.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to raise his dexterity stat. Although it was currently lower than stamina, it wasn&#x2019;t a bad performance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The most important thing in forging art is how it looks.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There were artworks at least several hundred years old. There were just as many that were under 100 years old.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to make fakes of such things, the perfection of the work was a basic thing. It was important for the artwork to look as old as the original year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If a 300 year old painting was as smooth as if it was painted yesterday, a child wouldn&#x2019;t be deceived.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Applying a specially prepared solution to the surface of the painting will make it age fast! Isn&#x2019;t this really good? Uh, wah! From the stains to the insect marks!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It took a long time to create a counterfeit artwork. A person could take a week to a month.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Big Mama completed a perfect quality work in only three days. </span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help but feel admiration.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Uh, my proficiency has gone up by one.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Once his proficiency level reached a certain level, he could know the meaning of what Big Mama was doing.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to do his own forgeries once his proficiency increased a bit more.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two weeks remaining until he had to go back to school.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Based on the current rate that his intelligence was rising, he would be able to achieve his desired grades.</span></p><p><span style="">He first decided to concentrate on acquiring the Forgery skill.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a homicide detective, and had 10 years of practical experience before achieving this rank.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was familiar with seeing these things.</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, he frowned as he saw the body in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">The body was odd.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk skillfully ordered his men to form a blockade around the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Signs that prohibited access were put up and the crime scene was closed.</span></p><p><span style="">Inspector Kim Do-shik, who arrived late, asked him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would be the person in charge of this case.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho! Did you call the coroner?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Inspector-nim arrived? He&#x2019;ll be here in a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik pulled back the tarp covering the corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help but moan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He raised a finger and pressed it firmly against the skin of the corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think she was drowned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The corpse still seemed alive.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... The coroner can only know after conducting the autopsy. It is likely that she was suffocated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. Is it strangulation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No strangulation injuries were found on the neck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik quietly covered the body with the tarp again.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk reported what he had found so far.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A female. Her age is in the early 20s, and her clothes have yet to be found. I have pulled the fingerprints to check her identity. The person who discovered it was a student who lived nearby, and I have someone taking care of them. After their shock has subsided, I will check the exact circumstances of the discovery.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But Detective Cho, it is still too premature to say. Have you ever seen a body like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The stomach... is her stomach full?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Yes. It is like she is pregnant.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two people&#x2019;s faces darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how long they worked, they still couldn&#x2019;t get used to this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! The coroner has arrived!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. First, let&#x2019;s see what he has to say. But really... This body is odd.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t answer properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was more qualified to beat up a gangster than to do something like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, tell me when the results come out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik sighed again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This world is really going crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The case proceeded quickly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The identity of the body was revealed and the signs were also accurate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, their questions weren&#x2019;t completely answered.</span></p><p><span style="">Detective Cho Kang-suk asked the coroner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Min-soo. How did she die?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo was a similar age to Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, they worked closely together so they were close friends.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo touched the glasses he was wearing and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are two signs. First, her intestines ruptured from drinking more water than they could tolerate, causing a blockage. She suffocated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s face turned white.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... She was tortured with water.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It doesn&apos;t seem like it. Do you know what happens when someone is tortured with water? In the beginning of the torture, they take some breaths. Eventually, the brain won&#x2019;t receive enough oxygen and they will lose consciousness. Then what would happen? The human body would somehow try to breathe in order to live. They will take a deep breath. However, there would be no air so eventually, water would get into the lungs. This breath is the end... It is over. The lung cells are destroyed. The body will die, and any artificial respiration is useless.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo spoke calmly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the contents were creepy.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So why isn&#x2019;t it water torture?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If someone was tortured with water, then they would naturally get water into their lungs. However, there is no water in her lungs. Therefore, this means that she drank a lot of water, but of her own will. And... The body didn&#x2019;t lose consciousness until the last minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was cruel.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She drank water until her stomach expanded and she died.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">But she didn&#x2019;t lose consciousness?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even until the moment she died from suffocation?</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk bit his lip. He bit too hard and blood came out.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo approached Cho Kang-suk and whispered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right. There were no signs of rape. It isn&#x2019;t a rape killing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s face distorted.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He muttered quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please, I wish that this body is the first and last.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo also nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I wish that as well. Kang-suk. Let me look at that crazy bastard&#x2019;s face. Please catch the culprit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk replied with cold eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will catch them... I must!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">After hearing about the body, Kim Do-shik called this the &#x2018;watering hippo&#x2019; case.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">That day, a special investigation headquarters was created.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Among the team members, Cho Kang-suk was included.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
