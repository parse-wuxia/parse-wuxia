<p><span style="">Chapter 93 - Big Brother&#x2019;s Raid #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The police couldn&#x2019;t work properly due to the numerous hostages being trapped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, most captors only asked for money or a means of escape.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the person in the building declared that he would kill all the hostages if Phantom wasn&#x2019;t brought here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">After completing a call with the police commissioner, the commando leader spat out words of frustration.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how he thought about it, the opponent was from a terrorist organization with a grudge against Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">About 30 minutes ago, a commando strike team was dispatched after hearing the news story that an armed villain was holding hostages in the middle of the city.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The leader of the commandos thought that the other person was just a gangster with a gun, and that they would be able to easily overpower him.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, the 1st squadron consisting of 12 people entered the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The commandos were a group that went through high intensity training.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were above ordinary soldiers in terms of combat skills, and all of them had exceptional skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When it came to suppressing terrorism, they were confident that they wouldn&#x2019;t fall behind the special forces of other countries.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the commandos leader soon realized that his judgement was wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry Chief-nim. The opponent installed booby traps in the building and completely blocked all access routes. He has a M60 machine gun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader felt dizzy at the report from his deputy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about the damage to us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Two people slightly wounded... Four people severely wounded... Fortunately, there were no casualties.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How can you say that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....I&apos;m really sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The number of enemies was at most three.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, 6 of the 12 people had come back with injuries?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The nation&#x2019;s largest counterterrorism force...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The deputy started making excuses.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a structure that is difficult to break into, due to the narrow passages inside. Furthermore, the opponent isn&#x2019;t a mere terrorist. The machine gun was aimed precisely at areas where there was no protective clothing. Furthermore, there aren&#x2019;t just machine guns, but rifles and shotguns...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stop your excuses. Prepare a second team to strike. Why isn&#x2019;t Detective Cho Kang-suk coming!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were only two people who could get in touch with Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of them was being held inside the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then somebody blocking the scene cried out loudly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho Kang-suk has arrived!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader looked at the place where the voice was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person he had been waiting for rushed in.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I am late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Detective Cho Kang-suk was accompanied by Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a criminal profiler and came along for negotiations with the criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho asked the deputy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There isn&apos;t much&#xA0;time left until the killer kills the first hostage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right. There is 10 minutes and 20 seconds left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. You should try to contact Phantom, and I will buy as much time as possible by trying to communicate with the criminal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader nodded favourably at Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So can you contact Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am trying. He seems to be in a place with no radio waves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hu... I don&#x2019;t know why innocent civilians need to get involved in the power struggle between criminals. Anyway, Investigator Joo Hyun-ho should buy as much time as possible. There will soon be a second attempt to penetrate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s face turned pale.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard that there are 30 hostages. If you try to break through with force, won&#x2019;t they be harmed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a shame for me as well. However, we are bound by the rule to not negotiate with terrorists. There needs to be some sacrifices.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s face distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">They should think of the people&#x2019;s lives as the top priority.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the hostages were treated like obstacles in the way of catching a terrorist.</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader noticed Kang-suk&#x2019;s atmosphere and tried to appease him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the first place, I think that people who work in a place like the karaoke bars are wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was counterproductive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s anger exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The police isn&#x2019;t here to kill terrorists, but to protect the people!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The face of the commandos leader turned red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Kang-suk was obviously right.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he would be broken if he was too upright.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to live in this world, sometimes a moderate compromise was needed.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk realized that he had shouted at someone higher than him and bowed his head,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....I&apos;m sorry. I am a little agitated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. It is too cruel for a man like you to live in this world. Anyway, please try to reach Phantom as soon as possible.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk wanted to go inside and save the hostages if he could, but he couldn&#x2019;t do that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, ah! Why isn&#x2019;t the call going throu...eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Did you contact Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although it wasn&#x2019;t a phone call, Phantom had sent him a text message.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho and the commandos leader gathered around Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;The culprit is a killer sent by the Triads, and there is only one person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha... A single person did all this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk ignored the commandos leader and continued to read Phantom&#x2019;s message.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He has already killed 10 hostages. There is a danger that they will all be wiped out if you try to forcefully enter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gathered people groaned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If all the hostages were killed then it meant the hostage taker would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So why did he kill the hostages so easily?&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were appalled when they imagined what was going on inside the building.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Breaching is forbidden. I am currently attempting contact. Oh, that is the end of the message.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The face of the commandos leader turned red after hearing the message.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that if left to the commandos, the hostages would die so don&#x2019;t interfere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he suddenly realized something.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait. That meant the Phantom is inside there now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It seems like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. Does this makes sense? The blockade is so tight that not even a single ant can get in. How did he get in there?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gathered people gulped and looked at the building where the hostages were being held. </span><span style="">Inside was the terrorist and the hostages...</span></p><p><span style="">And Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned off his smartphone and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I am listening to this conversation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had wiretapped the police and grasped their movements perfectly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, he needed expensive frequency detection equipment, a solar panel that supported 24 hour power, and a remote control device in order to bug them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had something better than a wiretapping device.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everybody carried their phones around with them everywhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He installed a Chinese hacking tool that Moonlight Flower put in the smartphones of Cho Kang-suk, the commandos leader, and the police commissioner.</span></p><p><span style="">He could listen to their conversations in real time and see the contents of their phones.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, there were security programs, but they couldn&#x2019;t stop the hacking tools that cost tens of thousands of dollars.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The only downside is the short shelf-life... Should I use this opportunity to learn cracking?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, sooner or later, he would have to visit China in order to deal with the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be nice if he could meet their hackers and learn their skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk analyzed the opponent by combining the information that the police had with his own.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The conclusion that emerged was that he had absolutely no chance of winning in a frontal confrontation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he had the crime skills, he would die if he was shot.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I&#x2019;m not an idiot to straight up fight a killer like in an action movie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk picked a suitable room and entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked at the things that were present.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Laptop, camera, microphone, lights. Perfect.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he had this equipment, then Internet broadcasting could be done anywhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Karaoke machines were installed in all rooms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were LAN connected for song data updates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The karaoke machines could be operated from the main counter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant he could broadcast a live video into the room of the killer.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk connected the LAN connected laptop to the control unit at the counter and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t be able to receive any balloons. Isn&#x2019;t this Phantom&#x2019;s Internet debut?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother checked the time and spoke to the hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the promised execution time. Who should I kill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then one of the hostages spoke in a quivering voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the unfortunate schoolgirl who was caught at the convenience store with her younger sister, Min Soo-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You&#x2019;ve already killed 10 people. Is that still not enough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Moths flying into the fire isn&#x2019;t an execution. Yes. I&#x2019;ll kill you first.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Min Soo-young&#x2019;s face turned white.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Spare me... I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Big Brother laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? I think your little sister is here with you. I&#x2019;ll let you live if you shoot her in the head. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-young&#x2019;s sister , Soo-yeon, who was two years younger than her, called out in a quivering voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Unni... I-I don&#x2019;t want to die... Huh? U-Unni...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two people grabbed each other&#x2019;s hands and stared into the other&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if it meant living, she couldn&#x2019;t kill her sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Soo-young spoke with determined eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I would rather die. Save my little sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh... This warm love between sisters, I like it. Then I will save your sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But I have one condition. The Yakuza cut their own belly to show their determination. Is it called harakiri? If you want to save your sister then shoot yourself with this. Then I will spare her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother pulled a gun from his waist and threw it towards Soo-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother laughed happily like he was enjoying this.</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-young picked up the gun and stared at the demon in front of her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Could she use this to kill the opponent?&#xA0;</span><span style="">That idea popped up but she shook her head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had seen the demon fighting the hostages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no way she could kill him with this small handgun.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you make a fuss then I will blow a hole in your sister&#x2019;s head, so be sure to shoot at your belly button.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-young&#x2019;s body shook like it was cold.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After cram school was over, she was thirsty and went to buy some milk with her sister...</span></p><p><span style="">How did she end up in this situation?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything seemed unreal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she closed her eyes then she might be able to return to reality.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sob... It isn&#x2019;t a dream...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In action movies, the protagonist could survive being shot with several bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Could she live like that?&#xA0;</span><span style="">With such hope, Soo-young aimed the muzzle of the gun at her stomach with trembling hands.</span></p><p><span style="">However, reality wasn&#x2019;t that easy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the 5.56mm bullet was fired, a hole the size of a finger would be made where the bullet entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be okay with just that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the bullet fired from the pistol would rotate and damage the internal organs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It also wasn&#x2019;t uncommon for there to be an exit hole.</span></p><p><span style="">This was a tool designed to kill people in the first place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Being shot in the belly would mean unconditional death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Please...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Please survive...</span></p><p><span style="">With that hope, Soo-young pulled the trigger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, she was about to pull it.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It seems like something interesting is happening.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The moment a man&#x2019;s voice was heard out of nowhere, Soo-young stopped her finger that was about to pull the trigger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother and the hostages looked in the direction of the voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A man in a phantom mask had appeared on the karaoke machine in the corner of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The machine was hacked.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">All the systems in this place are in my hands.</span></i> <i><span style="">You should surrender, rather than try to resist.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Big Brother smiled and walked over to the monitor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! It seems like you can hear my voice. You must have installed a bug somewhere. So what can you do? Huh? Are you going to pop out of the monitor like in a horror movie?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll show you proof that I am controlling all the systems.</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the electricity in the room turned off.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hostages shrieked as it suddenly became dark.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother had several more pistols besides what he gave to Soo-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He fired towards the door.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hik!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Trying to take advantage of the uproar to flee. Yes. Try to do it again a second time. Huhuhu.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man who tried to secretly open the door and run away stumbled back into the darkness of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Less than 10 seconds later, the lights in the room turned on again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The monitor also turned back on.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-How is it?</span></i> <i><span style="">This is what I am capable of.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ridiculous. Don&#x2019;t think you can deal with me by limiting my vision. The darkness won&#x2019;t be able to stop me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even in the darkness, Big Brother had accurately aimed at the hostage trying to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I have a prophecy.</span></i> <i><span style="">You will die here today.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bullshit!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother was provoked and fired a few bullets towards the monitor.</span></p><p><span style="">Smoke emerged and several pieces flew away.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Listen carefully. Stop talking bullshit and appear in front of me right now, or I will kill one hostage every minute. Well, if other people die, then your ratings will fall to the bottom. It means I don&#x2019;t have to look at you anymore.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother&#x2019;s words were only half right.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was obviously listening to his words, but it wasn&#x2019;t through a bug.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;By the way, he ruined the monitor after a little provocation. If I knew this earlier, then I would&#x2019;ve only recorded three minutes.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled bitterly from where he was hiding among the hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyway, the killer&#x2019;s brain is equivalent to Park Sung-kwang.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother thought he was having a real-time conversation with Phantom, but he was wrong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had just played a pre-recorded video on the karaoke machine.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He entered the room when the electricity went out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now there were two hostages in the room with the same face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Big Brother was agitated and failed to notice it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had disguised himself as Kwon Joon-hyuk and hid inside.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother thought there were only helpless hostages here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was shouting at an illusion of Phantom without knowing that an assassin had come in to kill him.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
