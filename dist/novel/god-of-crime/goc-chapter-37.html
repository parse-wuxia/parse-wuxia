<p><span style="">Chapter 37 - Aid</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m really sorry... I should have been paying more attention.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk bowed from where he was sitting at the kitchen table, a heartfelt expression of regret on his face.&#xA0;</span>Although Kang-suk had the face of a friendly neighbourhood hyung, he was actually a homicide detective.</p><p><span style=""> He had been too busy these past three weeks.&#xA0;</span>He only said that he had a case, and that he hadn&#x2019;t been able to catch the culprit yet.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk put the cutlery down in front of Kang-suk and said.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hyung doesn&#x2019;t need to be sorry, because I know that you are busy with work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Still! Hu... No. I couldn&#x2019;t receive phone calls properly because I was in meetings every single day. I&#x2019;ll kill him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk became aware of the events that happened to Tae-hyuk and Ha-ran after everything was resolved.&#xA0;</span>He truly seemed to be suffering at the fact that he was no help.</p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk turned and looked at Ha-ran&#x2019;s back who was cooking food in the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... Ha-ran said that she wanted to go back to university.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;If I knew this, then I wouldn&#x2019;t have donated all of my monetary rewards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk laughed. </span></p><p><span style=""> He felt like he was looking at a puppy that wanted to help its owner.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Why don&#x2019;t you confess? I&apos;ll help you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;W-What does that mean?! How could I say that to Ha-ran!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Hyung likes Noona, it&#x2019;s written all over your face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk&#x2019;s face turned beet red. The hulking bear easily became a simpleton.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;T-T-That isn&#x2019;t it! I have decided to first start as friends!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;F-Friends? What is Hyung doing?!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> It was easy for even Tae-hyuk, who had no experience in dating, to know that Kang-suk was taking the wrong approach with Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Anyways, have you been studying well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Wow, what a change in subject!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk realized something after the Rosario theft and the SY Capital incidents.&#xA0;</span>He couldn&#x2019;t take care of Ha-ran and Tae-min alone.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;In addition, I will have to start fighting the blacklist members in earnest.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk was a protector, who he could ask for help when things got dangerous. </span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk believed that was enough, but it turned out that wasn&#x2019;t the case. </span></p><p><span style=""> Therefore, Tae-hyuk prepared a big plan to change the future, which was to decrease the gap between Kang-suk and Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span>He could trust Kang-suk with Ha-ran. At the very least, he was a man who would shed his own blood before making a woman cry.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Besides, he likes Noona.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Even Tae-hyuk could tell that his sister was nice and pretty, so it wasn&#x2019;t unusual for Kang-suk to fall for her.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Hum hum. Will he actually become my hyung?&apos;</span></p><p><span style=""> According to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s memories, Kang-suk was an old bachelor in his 40s.&#xA0;</span>Kang-suk wasn&#x2019;t a popular type among women. In addition, he spent most of his youth running around, catching criminals. In the end, he attended a matchmaker to find a marriage partner; however, his dates would run away upon seeing Kang-suk. A big bear sitting down in a suit. It was quite a shocking sight. Kang-suk started to say that he was married to crime. In the end, he abandoned dating.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Hyung is charming when he laughs...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk lowered his voice to avoid Ha-ran hearing and said.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Kang-suk hyung. This is a gift.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk handed him an envelope with a smirk.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Eh? Are these planetarium admission tickets?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Go with Noona when you have some time on the weekend, she likes to see the stars. Say it is between friends. Can&#x2019;t you go and play with that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk coughed unnecessarily loudly.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Cough. I appreciate it. I have work this weekend though...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Then go next week! These tickets last for a month anyways.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry, but my weekends won&#x2019;t be free until this incident is over! Sob... I like the stars as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk lowered his head.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk felt a strange protective instinct emerge as he saw the hulking bear with a dispirited expression.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;While Hyung looks after Noona... I feel a strange maternal instinct!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk knew the truth about the two people.</span></p><p><span style=""> Ha-ran would be entering a dormitory cram school next month.&#xA0;</span>Prior to that, Tae-hyuk wanted for her to go on at least two or three dates with Kang-suk.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;In order for that to happen, I need to solve Hyung&#x2019;s murder case.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk had been working seven days a week recently. Even if he wanted to get closer to Ha-ran, there was just no time to.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk asked in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;By the way, Hyung. What case is it now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Well, I&#x2019;m sorry but I can&#x2019;t say. Now that the mass media has caught wind of it, special instructions have come down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Special instructions?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk mimed zipping his mouth closed.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk found out a few facts from Kang-suk&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style=""> First of all, there were at least two possible incidents if it needed to be kept secret.</span></p><p><span style=""> The media was more likely to make a fuss about a serial murder case.&#xA0;</span>Or, if they didn&#x2019;t want the media knowing, then it might be a terrorist attack that would cause a huge blow to the economy.</p><p><span style=""> Obviously, Kang-suk was responsible for one of two things.</span></p><p><span style=""> Cho Kang-suk said.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Anyway, let&#x2019;s eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> In front of the two people, there was the delicious smell of cooked mackerel.</span></p><p>@</p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to do this for Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk grumbled as he used the &#x2018;Violence&#x2019; skill on the roof of a house.</span></p><p><span style=""> In order for Kang-suk and Ha-ran to go on a date, Kang-suk&#x2019;s serial killer case had to be resolved.&#xA0;</span>He wouldn&#x2019;t have any time to spare before it was resolved. Tae-hyuk was going to use his crime skills to help Kang-suk.</p><p><span style=""> In the end, Kang-suk&#x2019;s job would be to take care of Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;First of all, let&apos;s check the performance of this skill.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The previous criminals that he met &#xA0;until now hadn&#x2019;t been all that dangerous.&#xA0;</span>He had to figure out exactly what he could do. Cho Kang-suk, a homicide detective, had been struggling for a few weeks, so it obviously wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary criminal.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Maybe it is one of the blacklist members.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk organized the list of criminals that he had written down.&#xA0;</span>He memorized the dangerous criminals&#x2019; names, what they were doing, and how they got caught.</p><p><span style=""> It was all listed in the blacklist.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Hrmm... So far, I&#x2019;ve met five?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> But one day, he would meet all of them. Tae-hyuk was sure of it.</span></p><p><span style=""> He had met Yoo Cheol-ho on the day he received the future memories. Tae-hyuk had then helped put him in prison.&#xA0;</span>Less than three weeks later, he got involved in the incident with Park Seong-ho&#x2019;s son, Park Sung-kwang. Not long after that, he met the thief Moonlight Flower and Big Mama.</p><p><span style=""> They were all criminals that Tae-hyuk remembered.&#xA0;</span>Wasn&#x2019;t this too much to be dismissed as a coincidence? It seemed like they were pulling him towards them.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Either way, this criminal isn&#x2019;t a joke. Who is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The prosecutors wouldn&#x2019;t be so desperate to conceal it if he wasn&#x2019;t a cruel person.&#xA0;</span></p><p>Anyway, Tae-hyuk felt confident now that he had acquired the Violence skill. Unlike in the past, he could now physically overpower the opponent.&#xA0;<span style="">It gave him a strange confidence.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk grabbed the iron pipe created by the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span>It allowed him to use his strength and agility.</p><p>Tae-hyuk wielded the iron pipe on the roof to rest how strong he was.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Certainly, my body moves well, but I still don&#x2019;t think it is enough to fight 17:1.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk was obsessed with the number 17:1.&#xA0;</span>Among Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s current stats, the lowest one was agility at 24 points.</p><p><span style=""> Therefore, the movement of the iron pipe didn&#x2019;t appeal to his spirit.&#xA0;</span>If he could attack a little quicker...</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Anyhow, I can summon an iron pipe any time I like. Isn&#x2019;t this surprisingly usable?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The pipe was dented, and there was a handprint on it.&#xA0;</span>At first, he was worried that moving it incorrectly would cause the pipe to bend. &#xA0; However, testing showed that it was very hard. It didn&#x2019;t get any scratches, even when he pit all his weight into it. He would be able to use it as support in emergency situations.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk put the iron pipe on his shoulder and pulled out the smartphone in his pocket.&#xA0;</span>It was a phone that he had newly acquired after the last incident.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;The time for restoring is almost over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> He checked and there were still a few minutes remaining.</span></p><p><span style=""> The smartphone used by Kang-suk stored most of the data on its own server.&#xA0;</span>If he had the ID and password then he could download it to his own smartphone. He could see everything from the contacts to the messages Kang-suk sent.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk asked Kang-suk for help with purchasing a new phone.&#xA0;</span></p><p>In the meantime, he had been using Ha-ran&#x2019;s old folder phone. In other words, it was a natural monument compared to the advanced technology of the smartphone.</p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk made an enlightened expression, like an American missionary visiting Korea, and started his lecture.&#xA0;</span>In the meantime, Tae-hyuk grabbed Kang-suk&#x2019;s smartphone and obtained the ID and password. It was that simple to obtain Kang-suk&#x2019;s personal information.</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;d like to see some information about the investigation. Please don&#x2019;t let me get nudes by mistake.&#x201D;</p><p><span style=""> First, he decided to be satisfied with this much.&#xA0;</span>After a few moments, the restoration of the phone was completed perfectly. A smartphone with the same information as Kang-suk&#x2019;s was born.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Then shall I check his messages?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk skillfully navigated the touch screen to check the messages and mailbox.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Wah. I feel nervous when there are no apps. By the way, he hasn&#x2019;t linked his mail account yet? He uses a smartphone like an old phone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue. Kang-suk acted like a primitive person. But Kang-suk was like a caveman.</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk only used three things on his smartphone.</span></p><p><span style=""> Telephone calls. Text messages. And the map.</span></p><p><span style=""> Anyway, he was able to get a clue about this case.&#xA0;</span>Then he muttered with a blank expression.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Wait a minute. Is Hyung part of this bastard&#x2019;s case?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> He was one of the five worst criminals recorded in the blacklist.</span></p><p><span style=""> The watering hippo.&#xA0;</span>That was his nickname.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk stared at a bathroom from far away.&#xA0;</span>One officer was standing guard. (TL: Bathroom in this case seems to refer to the public baths or sauna in Korea, not toilets)</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Perhaps this is where the incident happened.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk referred to the blacklist as he chased after the trail of the hippo.&#xA0;</span>But there was one strange thing.</p><p><span style=""> The hippo he remembered didn&#x2019;t start now, but three months later.&#xA0;</span>Then why were there already victims? But looking at the method and frequency, the criminal was clearly the hippo.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;There are already two victims.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> There was a common point about the days when the hippo committed a crime. </span></p><p><span style=""> It was a day with a full moon.&#xA0;</span>He murdered every 29 days.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk looked up at the sky.</span></p><p><span style=""> There was a round man with a slight dark edge in a corner.&#xA0;</span>There was three days to the next full moon.</p><p><span style=""> Before that, he had to find the trail of the hippo.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s make a connection.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk took out his phone and called the officer standing guard.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
