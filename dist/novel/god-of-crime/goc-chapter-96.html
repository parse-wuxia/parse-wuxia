<p><span style="">Chapter 96 - Advance Notice of a Storm #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">As a result of the fight against the terrorist, Phantom was being broadcasted on TV every day.</span></p><p><span style="">Among them, the interviews with the survivors of the terrorist attacks garnered a lot of interest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the screen, a woman who was suffering relatively minor injuries was explaining the situation at that time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Some of the men tried to lunge at the terrorist. They thought that despite the fact that he had a gun, he was still a human, and could be beaten. When they failed, I really thought that I would die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A reporter holding a microphone asked from next to her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then he appeared?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He emerged from a place that the terrorist never expected.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter knew the outline of the case, but shivered and pretended ignorance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did he break through the ceiling?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nope. He was mixed in among the hostages. The person that the culprit thought was ordinary suddenly pulled out a phantom mask and put it on his face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohu... Then did you see the Phantom&#x2019;s face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. But I don&#x2019;t think it is his original face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman hesitated for a moment before replying.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That...there was a man who was groaning next to me, and Phantom had the same face as him. They obviously aren&#x2019;t twins... Maybe Phantom has the ability to disguise himself with another&#x2019;s face.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Perhaps it is special makeup or something like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know. Then he suddenly pulled an iron pipe from somewhere and started fighting the terrorist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He fought that monster with an iron pipe?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is certainly a famous weapon, but using it to fight a terrorist armed with powerful weapons... It sounds a little reckless.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thought so as well. No matter how great Phantom is, I thought that he couldn&#x2019;t beat a gun with an iron pipe. Then an amazing thing happened. The terrorist shot Phantom&#x2019;s face... Blood appeared on the face of the shooter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Changing his face could be explained with special makeup.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, not only did he survive a gunshot, but he also wounded the opponent?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a mystery that was impossible to prove with modern science.</span></p><p><span style="">The reporter finished the interview with some last words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for the good words in the midst of the confusion. Then, let&#x2019;s connect to a correspondent who will take you inside the building where the incident took place. Now, shall we see how the Phantom fought the terrorist? Come out!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The screen faded out before changing scenes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho turned off the TV from where he was lying down on the ICU bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. Phantom came to my rescue, but I couldn&#x2019;t interview him properly... I&#x2019;m not qualified as a journalist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwon Joon-hyuk, who was lying on the next bed, raised his body half-way up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems so. It would&#x2019;ve been a much more plausible scene if you were there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, didn&#x2019;t Phantom know my heart? He risked his life in order to protect me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha? Really?</span></p><p><span style="">Kwon Joon-hyuk barely refrained from saying the words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh... There is no time for this. Ask the doctor when I can be discharged. If I can just get an exclusive interview then the ratings...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t changed despite almost dying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was still Shin Se-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwon Joon-hyuk sighed and quietly muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo... It is the same as you smearing dung on the wall. Can you really catch that guy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately for Shin Se-ho, he wouldn&#x2019;t get the desired interview with Phantom for some time.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When I think about it again, this skill it too crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was lying on a bed and looking at the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t aware due to the anesthetic, but he had suffered serious injuries.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if the damage was decreased by half, he was still shot at close range.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His shoulder bones were broken and the muscles had ruptured.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After an X-ray, the doctor said that it was amazing that he was still alive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled the situation at that time and shivered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was definitely shot in the head... If it wasn&#x2019;t for the skill then I would be riding the express train to hell.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The doctor said that his skull was cracked and the optic nerve shocked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the time being, more medical treatment was needed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just lying still would cause him to feel dizzy and nauseous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he closed his eyes, he would see something like flashing lights.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For a while, it felt like he was treated as a dead rat.</span></p><p><span style="">The hospital where Tae-hyuk was resting in didn&#x2019;t have any signs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a place for criminals who couldn&#x2019;t go to a proper hospital, or those who needed illegal treatments.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The facility was unexpectedly very neat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite&#xA0;the lack of signs, it was better than a general neighborhood hospital.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Seo Tae-hyuk. It is time for your regular checkup.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The door opened and a man with thick horned glassed entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s primary doctor, Jung Eui-do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is there any particular place where you are feeling pain?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">A nurse with a brusque expression untied the bandage wrapped around Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Jung Eui-do asked with shining eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You said that you rolled down the stairs right? You weren&#x2019;t shot with a gun?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I really did roll down the stairs. I thought you didn&#x2019;t ask that type of thing here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo... I&#x2019;m sorry. I have been working here as a doctor for a long time, but I can&#x2019;t help my curiosity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you normally do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I am a specialist in abortions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was surprisingly easy to find unlicensed doctors in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them did simple cosmetic surgery or abortions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In South Korea, having an abortion was an illegal procedure, so a back alley doctor was required for it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The reason why the facility is so well-equipped...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do was a really chatty doctor, which was why Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t need to ask anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is okay until 10 weeks. The fetus starts to swell as arms and legs start forming, and after 25 weeks, it almost feels like I am killing a person instead of doing an abortion. Ah right, our hospital will do abortions up to 36 weeks. If you know anyone who needs one then please contact me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do smiled and pulled out a business card.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk accepted it with a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;36 weeks is almost murder.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe this doctor had killed more people than the murderer he fought a week ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since the medical treatment would take some time, Jung Eui-do continued to talk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When I&#x2019;m here at night, I think I hear the sound of babies crying. Don&#x2019;t you think that is strange?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ignored Jung Eui-do and looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the contents of the story couldn&#x2019;t be ignored.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, it has been 100 years since the building where this hospital is was built. It used to be the headquarters of the Japanese army. In the basement, prisoners were tortured and killed every day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...The Japanese?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. After Korean became independent, they rushed away in a hurry, leaving something great hidden here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It might be dismissed as a ghost story told about an old building, but Tae-hyuk had heard this somewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was clearly a memory from the future...</span></p><p><span style="">So maybe he might find a clue in Jung Eui-do&#x2019;s story.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put the Demon Revealing Mirror away and focused on the doctor&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is hidden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s what I mean. The Japanese gathered gold in South Korea and turned them into gold bullions. Then they buried them somewhere... This place...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Surely the gold wasn&#x2019;t here?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When considering the Japanese army, that gold would be worth tens of billions of won.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gold...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I guessed there were clues leading to the hidden location, so I hired people and searched all over the place. But it looks like I was duped by the person who sold me the building. Ahahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it is a common ghost story. At any rate, it was interesting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do finished the examination of Tae-hyuk and explained the results with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you eat any wild ginseng? The bones are already almost restored. I think you can be discharged in two weeks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am better than wild ginseng. I can&#x2019;t die that easily.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, you have a great resilience.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was really fortunate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Jung Eui-do made a few more jokes before leaving the room.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was left alone to think quietly with a very serious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be nice if it was a story that could be ignored.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Japanese fleeing without their treasure.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They left clues behind to where it was buried.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The old Japanese army... Wasn&#x2019;t there something like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk had memories of the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were definitely something about the Japanese army in it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Was it two years later?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Some gold that the Japanese army hid was found, causing the whole country to become noisy for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The full amount was returned to the nation&#x2019;s treasury, with the finder only being given 50 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I forgot the spot where it was discovered...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If Jung Eui-do&#x2019;s story was true...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe Tae-hyuk could find something enormous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t the original finder only given a pittance? But if I were the one to find it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could swallow it up alone without the government noticing!&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never imagined that his future memories would help in this way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am going to be here for a while anyway... Should I start searching for a treasure map?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The gold was said to be discovered by chance when the building was renovated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, the clue was hidden in a place with no light.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A treasure map that no one else has found. Isn&#x2019;t this amazing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes lit up.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, there would be no damages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Jung Eui-do said he searched this area but couldn&#x2019;t find it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was obviously quite disappointed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was probably why he told his patients the story.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In this case, I can use the Spying skill.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Every day was so idle that hospital life seemed very enjoyable.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gathered at Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s call.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wondered if Kim Do-shik wanted him to contact Phantom again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Now I dream of a phantom mask every night... Isn&#x2019;t this terrible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since the fight against the terrorist, the pressure from above to catch Phantom had increased, but they were unable to do so.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, Detective Cho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but there has been no contact from Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like you&#x2019;re going to have a nervous breakdown. I&apos;m sorry but this time it isn&#x2019;t because of Phantom. A letter came for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A letter?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was baffled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t part of the general affairs section, so why would someone send a letter to him?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Park Sung-yul sent it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Park Sung-yul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">The first heinous criminal that he caught.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for brutally murdering a woman in her 40s.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Read it first. If the contents are true... You are the one who is most familiar with Park Sung-yul. I wanted to hear your opinion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it a case?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just read it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gulped. He slowly opened it and read Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s letter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oh my god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The letter contained words that Kang-suk could never imagine.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
