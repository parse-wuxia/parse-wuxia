<p><span style="">Chapter 70 - DATE HARD 2.0 #3 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The restaurant cafe, Ludwig, was a so-called hidden attraction.</span></p><p><span style="">By default, it was a live cafe where people could eat while simultaneously listening to music.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The high quality performances and delicious food meant that it was one of the most popular dating venues among couples.</span></p><p><span style="">The owner&#x2019;s taste meant that there were fairly high quality music equipment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Amateur bands and folk singers came in overwhelming numbers with a desire to perform.</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, there was only one couple present.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Kang-suk and Seo Ha-ran were sitting down and waiting for their food, but behind the scenes, a fierce war of nerves was occurring.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Originally, it was impossible for me to do this at this price, but I specifically did it for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk just glanced at the restaurant owner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sometimes silence was worth 100 words when bargaining.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The owner couldn&#x2019;t stand it and cleared his throat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A contract to rent the entire restaurant obviously included the food and the stage.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... Of course, the food is made by the best chef as you said...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But the problem is that the show is missing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sweat flowed down the owner&#x2019;s chin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Today was Christmas Eve, the best day of the year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was from the evening onwards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From 15:00 to 17:00, it was literally called Break Time where the restaurant was closed.</span></p><p><span style="">A customer specifically wanted to rent that time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As the owner, he naturally welcomed the customer with both hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The meals could be cooked in advance, and he could serve it himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But there was a problem.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a simple restaurant, but a cafe restaurant that served food while watching a show.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha, ha, ha... I am sorry for that. But really, you don&#x2019;t have a person to perform?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">By doing this, he could rent the restaurant at an unbelievably low price.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this trap was waiting for him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere wouldn&#x2019;t exist if there were no performances.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be helped. Can I borrow the stage instead?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The stage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. A date should have music.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The owner&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Will you be performing directly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will use classical music to set up the atmosphere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough. Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, he would absolutely never allow customers on stage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The expensive equipment could break, and it was against the policy of the restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, what was happening today was at the fault of the restaurant, so it was natural for the owner to take a low profile.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk added one last thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, please note that the stage might be noisy. Even if the equipment is broken, I will reimburse you in full so don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, I understand. Then please show a great stage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The owner nodded with a pleasant expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was inwardly laughing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He thought that the customer just wanted to stand on the stage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At best, it would be a tambourine and some karaoke skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did he even know how to turn on the amps?</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was a money-giving customer, so the owner bowed politely.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I have to go and prepare the dessert. The stage is opposite of the hallway.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quickly headed to the place that the owner directed.</span></p><p><span style="">No show?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he would do it himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, there was still a bit of time until Nuclear Bomb&#x2019;s henchmen arrived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would come up with something suitable during that time.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Indeed, a sweet song added to the dating atmosphere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t handle instruments, no matter how many crime skills he had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he could imitate voices, and he could use a CD for the accompaniment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t Ave Maria be played on Christmas?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the song of greeting that was sung when the angel Gabriel visited the Virgin Mary when baby Jesus was conceived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the best song for a date on Christmas Eve.</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can directly imitate the voice of Lee Yong-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Singer Lee Yong-ho!&#xA0;</span><span style="">With his profound voice and gentle stage manners, he was a celebrity that sometimes appeared on TV.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It was worth spending a lot of money to watch his performance.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and turned on the microphone before singing along with the accompaniment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The restrained voice of a soprano spread throughout the restaurant and into the hearts of those listening.</span></p><p><span style="">After singing a song to praise Mary, it was time for a carol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The favourite song of the Koreans was Mariah Carey&#x2019;s All I Want For Christmas Is You.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would make the heart that rose up from Ave Maria pound even more.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk and Seo Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The stage for only those two was unfolding.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, there is suddenly a song. What song is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ave Maria. It is so powerful that it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be coming from a CD. It seems like someone is on stage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can&#x2019;t see it from here... Are we sitting in a corner?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk discovered that they couldn&#x2019;t see the stage from where they were sitting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why did Tae-hyuk tell him to sit here?</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, the restaurant was empty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be good to sit in a place where they could see the stage well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk thought so and asked Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want to move to a place where we can see the stage better?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... I just feel like listening. In addition, I&#x2019;d feel sorry for the waiter if I move the food after eating. We can just keep eating here...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I don&#x2019;t care as long as Ha-ran is fine with it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gazed at Ha-ran sitting in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was so beautiful that it was hard for him to even look at her properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran blinked at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is there something on my face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. You are so beautiful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Y-You don&#x2019;t need to go that far...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nope. I am serious. It is embarrassing that I can&#x2019;t even express the full extent of your beauty.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes were serious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first, he thought that she was just a beautiful woman when they first met.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he met her the second time, he realized that it wasn&#x2019;t just her appearance that was beautiful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was really sweet and beautiful...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm hmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk coughed while blushing,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha... Kang-suk is also cool. Those clothes suit you really well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two quietly started eating the food, and the music turned into an exciting carol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a Christmas blessing for both of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The date that started from the bowling alley, planetarium, and amusement park was nearing its end.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Today was really fun. I&#x2019;m scared to be this happy...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ha-ran stopped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was something strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of a sudden, she felt a deep despair as she thought back.</span></p><p><span style="">As Ha-ran&#x2019;s face darkened, Kang-suk&#x2019;s expression became serious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He quietly wrapped his hands around Ha-ran&#x2019;s.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha-ran. You know that my job is to catch criminals who have done bad things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... I&#x2019;m aware of that. You are doing a really good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I punish those who are doing bad things. However, is there nothing in the opposite direction? I think I give their victims the right to be happy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Happy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Today was fun.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, indeed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t want it to end today. I hope that Ha-ran will continue being happy in the future. So... Ah... That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran realized that there was a strange attitude around Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He kept putting his hands in his pocket and was touching something.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran smiled gently at the nervous Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay. If your words are hard to say then I&#x2019;ll wait. I&#x2019;m really good at waiting. So please slow down and tell me. Yes? For example, I think I waited a long time for someone... Ahaha. I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m tired.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Umm. T-Then, by the way, will you date me again next time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stuttered out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran replied with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk cheered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although he couldn&#x2019;t communicate everything properly, he could do it slowly from now on.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right, Ha-ran. After the meal, there is a place I&#x2019;d like to go with you. This wasn&#x2019;t in the original plan, but I&#x2019;m sure that you&#x2019;ll like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a large sack beside the table where the two people were sitting, large enough to accommodate one person.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked at it and smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he missed this on Christmas Eve then he would feel regret.</span></p><p>@</p><p><span style="">It was time for Nuclear Bomb to arrive.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, I thought this was going to be Hiroshima.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He bribed one of the henchmen to report the movements of the group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They betrayed their group so easily for one million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was the weight of a bad group.</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, the time constraints meant there was no encore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He received information from the source that the point of entry would be the through back door of the restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved to set up a trap that was prepared in advance.</span></p><p><span style="">Then once it was the scheduled time, voices were heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s go through the back door as I said before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The henchmen quickly followed Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s instructions, holding iron pipes and baseball bats in their hands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t properly armed because they thought it would be a one-sided fight against Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue as he watched through the surveillance camera.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. Don&#x2019;t you know the basics of a raid? At least 30% of the total number of infiltrators should support from outside. Everyone coming in...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed that all of Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s group had entered and activated the trap.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, darkness?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Turn on the LED of your phones!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;U-Ugh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-what is this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s group started screaming, as something sticky had covered them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned on the light of the room and looked down at Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s group who were tangled together.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;In this way, all of you are wiped out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a basic booby trap.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk set up a large net with glue at the expected point of infiltration.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had fallen and neutralized all but two people of the group of 10.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What the fuck!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;L-Let us go!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What was the point of installing a trap if he was just going to release them?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Using this much force against a student.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk twisted the iron pipe that he equipped with the Violence skill and winked at one of the two people not trapped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That person was the spy.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The two people left, do you want to be stuck together?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled wickedly at the mice stuck together.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, what do I do with you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I will kill you! Release me right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are so many false words. Ah, yes. This is an opportunity to experiment with a new magic.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M-Magic? What are you...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It won&#x2019;t hurt. Hang in there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lightly stepped forward and touched the bodies of the gangsters lying on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Numerous messages appeared in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He practiced so much that he could alternate stealing the clothes of the opponents.</span></p><p><span style="">The clothing that the opponents were wearing moved to his right hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He threw them away and tapped another person lightly with his other hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After repeating this a few times, he was able to strip all eight people of their clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Argggghhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? What did you do?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-T-That bastard!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The gangsters started to scream.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I left your underwear behind due to my conscience. Now, shutter time!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pulled out a camera and started to take photos of the naked men thrashing around.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Click!</span></i> <i><span style="">Click!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ohhh.....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong&#x2019;s group moaned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your personal motto was &#x2018;to live and die like men&#x2019; right? Then what would happen if these photos were scattered around the neighbourhood?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Stop!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you short on words?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-Please stop!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat on a chair and showed the people the photos he just took on the digital camera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Screams could be heard from here and there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, let&#x2019;s negotiate. Will you continue to fight me as enemies? Of course, if you do so, then you won&#x2019;t be able to prevent these photos from being printed and scattered around. Or I can give you a part time job taking care of things that I&#x2019;d rather not do. Of course, I will take care of the costs. Well. This much for one time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly raised two fingers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang Han-seong swallowed his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden, there was an offer from the opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This&#xA0;doesn&#x2019;t mean that you will become my subordinates. It is just a formal contract. Of course, I am the one in charge.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Do you mean things like beating up your enemies?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You understand quickly. It is something similar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Kang Han-seong and his henchmen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I need some long-term pieces I can move at will.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he gave them money then he could use them moderately.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would be able to use them to fight other criminals in the future.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
