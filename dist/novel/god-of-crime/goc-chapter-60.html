<p><span style="">Chapter 60: It seems like something is going on #2 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, get down!&quot;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk leaned down reflexively at the explosion. The bomb had already exploded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a few seconds, the aftermath of the explosion would hit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s stats were reinforced by the Violence skill, making it possible to move beyond humanly possible speeds.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moonlight Flower was one step ahead of Tae-hyuk and was hiding her body in a safe place.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the problem was the guide.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She thought that there was some accident, and was standing still like a broken mannequin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, she would get caught in the explosion and receive a big injury.</span></p><p><span style="">A person who received a great shock would be frozen in place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they were able to cope with the situation then they could live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But if they were in a blank state and couldn&#x2019;t do anything, leading to their deaths.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was in such a state.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk reflexively kicked her leg.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She screamed as her body curved like a bow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed the falling guide and rolled down the stairs in a hugging position.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They rolled a few metres in an instant.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kukukukung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A little later, the shock wave hit the surprised people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, he had fallen down considerably and could avoid any direct hits.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Flames appeared just above his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The surviving people started to scream.</span></p><p><span style="">It looked like Hell had arrived on Earth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had seen a similar situation before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was just a few days ago, when he had participated in a death game where dozens of people could die.</span></p><p><span style="">However, that was an area where human nature caused the deaths.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What was happening here was far beyond that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t know anything then he would&#x2019;ve lost his life.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip as he rolled across the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The good news was that he was somehow spared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a result of the warning from the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A hidden ability of the Spying skill...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It consumed a staggering 20 affinity points in order to warn of a crisis.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were still many things about the crime skill that he didn&#x2019;t know yet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The problem was that it wouldn&#x2019;t be mentioned unless the conditions were met.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Perhaps there are conditions like collecting more than 20 affinity points.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">His affinity points had disappeared in an instant, but he didn&#x2019;t feel regret since it had saved his life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;Well. In fact, it is a waste. Damn!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moaned with a pained expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, he once again realized how valuable affinity points were.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a game, but was like having an extra life in reality.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he could afford it then he would have to stockpile over 20 points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk let go of the unconscious guide and stood up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang, who was hiding behind a protruding structure, came out from hiding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was looking around with eyes that were as wide as a meerkat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She smiled brightly as soon as she found Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah, you&#x2019;re alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged and said with a strict, but sincere expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are also alive. Did you hide alone in a safe place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehehe...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t hate a woman like that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s get out of here. Soon the water tanks will collapse and the water will pour out.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hup!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang closed her mouth and nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly exclaimed.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower - Yoo Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She showed more speed than him, despite Tae-hyuk being enhanced by the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe she could have survived even without his warning.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had a foolishly pure personality, but he had confidence in her physical abilities.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We will go down first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know a safe place to go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. For now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kukukung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed the status of the huge tanks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a lot of cracking as if the water would pour out in that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a room down there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t completely stop the water but it was better than outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk closed his eyes for a moment before running towards the door while carrying the guide.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">[Agility has increased due to your rapid actions beyond your limits.]</span></p><p><span style="">Stamina (59), Intelligence (47), Agility (29), Dexterity (39)</span></p><p><span style="">The message from the Demon Revealing Mirror flashed in front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had definitely exceeded his limits.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he hesitated for even a moment, then he would&#x2019;ve been caught by the water pouring down from the tanks.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What the hell is going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang asked with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s what it sounds &#xA0;like. A bomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... I always thought that such things were on the news. But I still managed to live. Ahaha... What a disaster movie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang was laughing in these circumstances.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was shocked and he was starting to doubt her mental state.</span></p><p><span style="">The guide was still unconscious.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk examined the area that they were currently in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a passage with dim lighting, a place that led from the 4B floor of Atlantis to the amenities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he kept moving along the passageway, then he would find places such as restaurants and arcades.</span></p><p><span style="">Outside of the door was water, and this place also wouldn&#x2019;t last long.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have to worry about breathing due to the ventilation system, but he couldn&#x2019;t wait forever.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go inside. This place won&#x2019;t hold out for long.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk tapped the firmly closed door with his finger.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Water was already seeping through the cracks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had to move to a deeper place to avoid the water coming in here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The passage, which led to the theater and various facilities, was as complicated as a maze.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The outward passage was already blocked by water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were like trapped rats.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang started to search the passage with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think there is only one way to get out of here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it the ventilation ducts?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? How did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang gazed at Tae-hyuk with wide eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, Tae-hyuk knew what was happening now.</span></p><p><span style="">The Atlantis sinking incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a famous disaster that was the prelude to the appearance of the bomber, Kim Tae-sung.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bomb that detonated and caused dozens of casualties was just the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="">The more vicious thing was that he installed it in the place with huge water tanks, containing thousands of tons of water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were made of special material that didn&#x2019;t break even when shot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they were unable to withstand the high temperatures of the explosion and shattered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the enormous amount of water hit the survivors.</span></p><p><span style="">The original architecture had a place built underground to escape from a situation just like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But for some reason, it was missing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After the accident occurred and hundreds of people died, people started calling for punishment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the culprit was a senior official who received hundreds of millions in bribes from large corporations.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bereaved families even held a hunger strike.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it ended without any proper punishment.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The conclusion was that hundreds of people died due to two criminals.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He lost his appetite.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed as he confirmed the message in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to gain one affinity point for saving the guide.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Many people died in this incident, but that didn&#x2019;t mean that there were no survivors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew how they survived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They escaped through the vents.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he replied to Ha-yang.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In movies like this, the people would escape through the vents.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right! Most underground facilities are linked to the outside. In the end, we need to find the way there...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang was a thief so she was familiar with the layout of buildings.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She paused briefly with a troubled expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...The problem is that this is an unnecessarily complex structure. If I had enough time then I would be able to find a way out, but... Well, I think I am lacking time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That certainly is true. The time limit should be around 30 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang nodded at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know the structure...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes flashed at those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. If you know the structure of the place, will you be able to get out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Of course! I am a thief as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew a way to understand the structure of this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to use a crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I can analyze this place using the Spying skill. Then create a map using the Forgery skill...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror to examine the details of the Spying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could reinforce the skill by investing affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was something that would be useful right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Extend Spying range...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was necessary for Spying to be used on the whole building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he didn&#x2019;t have enough points for that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk currently only had one affinity point.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed 10 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to get it...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He said&#xA0;with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The details are hard to explain but there is a way to get an overview of this place. But in order to do that, you need to save others. I need Noona&#x2019;s strength.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t talk about the crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But Yoo Ha-yang knew that Tae-hyuk had some special abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He might be her only hope of getting out of here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. Staying calm even in this situation... In fact, despite my words... I&#x2019;m really scared right now... This is the first time. I joked around but there really was a bomb... Furthermore, I don&#x2019;t know when the water will come in here. Then the vents will be dangerous. I didn&#x2019;t even think about what to do until just before. But do you really have a way to get out of this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang was smiling brightly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But her eyes were shaking.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t miss this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He nodded without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If so, I will help you. Like you saved countless people from the Death Circus, can you save me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is over when I get my date home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The tension disappeared from Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. Even in a situation like this... At any rate, I&#x2019;ll do it. Give me instructions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course he meant his words.</span></p><p><span style="">Besides, it didn&#x2019;t end when he escaped from here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bomber Kim Tae-sung had appeared three months early.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to fight him, Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s help was needed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t let her die in a place like this.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quickly and accurately issued instructions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cell phone?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. However, the radio waves don&#x2019;t work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is enough. As long as you can check the time. There are certainly a few survivors in this space. Find as many as possible and direct to the...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled as much of the structure of this place as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He remembered the place that the water didn&#x2019;t reach until the last moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He told Ha-yang that place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Then I&#x2019;ll be there in exactly 600 seconds.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. At least three people... No, I would like four or more if possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! Leave it to me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang disappeared into the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her animal senses would surely save a lot of people.</span></p><p><span style="">He gazed at the affinity points showing on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed and looked at the guide.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to deal with her then look for other survivors.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Have you recovered?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked after slapping the guide on the cheek.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes... A-Am I alive?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guide tearfully said.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had been in shock and lost her mind for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But if you don&#x2019;t get out of here in a hurry then it will probably be flooded.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guide looked around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were in a deeper place, not outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I am going to find other survivors. Go to the underground game centre and wait there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guide&#x2019;s face instantly paled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It looked as though she thought that Tae-hyuk was abandoning her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N-No! Are you trying to run away alone? I-I&#x2019;m going to follow you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In such a state?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guide&#x2019;s feet were shaking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to walk properly without receiving any support.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I will still follow. P-Please...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not really throwing you away. Please just wait. I will come to pick you up soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have time to keep talking like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned around to look for other survivors.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Deopsseok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The guide threw her body and grabbed Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She clung desperately to his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like she would die right away if she let go.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh... Really frustrating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I am Oh Soo-ah. P-Please take me along. I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I mean, just wait a minute!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you will go away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no end to this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk eventually decided on something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pulled Soo-ah up from where she was holding on to his right leg.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Soo-ah noona. Do you want to see a magic trick?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? A-All of a sudden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clapped and raised his palms in front of his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the only magic that I know!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled apart his hands and revealed the underwear she was wearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Soo-ah&#x2019;s face turned red at the familiar piece.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave a rotten smile while holding the black lace underwear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted to end it with only one thing but you tied up my arms and legs...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He absolutely didn&#x2019;t steal this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was made from magic!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk removed Soo-ah&#x2019;s arms and moved to find another survivor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, there were no witnesses. Ohuhu... It was completely a crime!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Soo-ah was left being with a red face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the lace underwear wasn&#x2019;t enough to break her.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
