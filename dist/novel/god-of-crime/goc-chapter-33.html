<p><span style="">Chapter 33 - Ill-Fated Relationship from a Past Life #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk was holding a piece of paper in his hand with information on SY Capital written on it.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is five million won per sheet...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk had asked Big Mama to find out information on SY Capital.&#xA0;</span>Exactly one day later, he knew everything about them.</p><p><span style=""> First of all, their outward appearance was of a prosperous company that was officially registered as a business.&#xA0;</span>It was a place where blue-chip companies listened to advice about taxes. However, that was just its outward appearance.</p><p><span style=""> Behind them was an organization of gangsters who did all types of dirty work.&#xA0;</span>Illegal debt collection. Gambling. Drug sales. There were also rumours of long-term smuggling.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style=""> There was a politician behind them so the police were unable to do anything.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk saw the name of the politician and laughed.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;It is literally an ill-fated relationship from a past life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> With his skills alone, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to fight SY Capital.&#xA0;</span>Therefore, he came up with an idea.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;If I can&#x2019;t fight with my skills that I have right now, then I need to learn new skills.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk knew most of the mechanisms to learn skills.&#xA0;</span>If the opponent had a crime skill, then he would learn it. Then, it had to be perfectly used against the original owner.</p><p><span style=""> The title [God of Crime] gave him this ability.&#xA0;</span>Until now, he had taken advantage of it after acquiring the skills. This time, however, he would be able to predict what type of skills he would get in advance.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s gaze was fixed at one point on the report.&#xA0;</span>It was about an illegal casino secretly operated by SY Capital.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;One billion won a day. Isn&#x2019;t that quite big?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> There were five dishonest gamblers in charge of it.&#xA0;</span>The main events were Go-Stop, Go, Seven Card Stud Poker, Texas Hold&#x2019;em...</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;The events mainly consists of playing cards.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> This casino was different from the other casinos that were more focused on oriental games, making it a well known casino for those visiting from Russia or North America.&#xA0;</span>Thus, foreigners chose events where they knew the rules.</p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;There are kids who play internationally.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> The minimum bet amount was one million, and ff people kept raising that amount by several times, then tens of millions of won would appear on the table.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk was a perfectly normal high school student who had never tried playing cards.</span></p><p>Gambling was something that he had done with his roommates in prison. The bets were special foods that came with that day&#x2019;s diet.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk grinded his teeth together as he remembered that time.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Those damn cheating scum...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> It was normal for a full house and a straight flush to come out often.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk only got two pairs, and was deceived every day. Later, he learned that they were the nation&#x2019;s top dishonest gamblers who used their skills to get things like chocolate and drinks. Those days had been full of suffering. But now he had the crime skills!</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk muttered quietly.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Then this time, will I get the Gambling skill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The goal was set.&#xA0;</span>Now it was time for the preparations.</p><p>&amp;</p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sipped a lukewarm hot chocolate as he waited for someone in a cafe.&#xA0;</span>It was late in the afternoon, so there were few people inside.</p><p><span style=""> The door opened and middle-aged man in a trench coat entered.&#xA0;</span>Tae-hyuk got up and waved his hand.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hello. Detective Park Jung-bae?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae was a man with an impressive beard.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh, are you Seo Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae sat in front of Tae-hyuk and ordered a glass of cold water.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I can&#x2019;t afford a cup of coffee that costs 5,000 won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> He said while wiping his face with a wet towel.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Did you hear the story from Big Mama?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ah, Mama? I heard it! So, what can I do to help?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I am thinking of eating up the gambling place operated by SY Capital, and I want Detective-nim to watch from the sidelines.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Hahaha! Eat up SY? You don&#x2019;t seem to be a dishonest gambler.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Just wait and see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae&#x2019;s eyes flashed.&#xA0;</span>Every time he laughed, a strong smell flowed out from his mouth.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;You know that I have a line with SY Capital?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae was a corrupt police officer, and took care of several problems for criminal organizations in exchange for money.</span></p><p><span style=""> He was the complete opposite of Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span>If Tae-hyuk wanted to team up with the police, then he would work with Kang-suk. However, Kang-suk had been working overtime lately due to a recent case.</p><p><span style=""> In the end, he was forced to find another police officer through Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Besides, I don&#x2019;t want Kang-suk hyung to commit a crime. It is better off like this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Kang-suk had to be Ha-ran and Tae-min&#x2019;s protector until the end.</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae drank the cold water and said.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;So how much money can you give me?&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae chuckled with a satisfied face at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s answer.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Kuahaha! Yes. You are a person being nurtured. That should be enough!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;The operation is in three days at the SY casino.&#x201D;</span></p><p>&amp;</p><p><span style="">It was the day of the fight.</span></p><p><span style=""> After finishing all of their preparations, Seo Tae-hyuk and Park Jung-bae headed out to the casino operated by SY Capital.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;Oh, isn&#x2019;t this a hotel?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae brought Tae-hyuk to the upper lounge suite of a hotel.</span></p><p><span style=""> This was the destination.</span></p><p><span style=""> The following scene was the first image he thought of when he heard that it was an illegal casino.&#xA0;</span>There were fluorescent lights, boxes filled with money, and even bottles rolling around on the ground. Opening the door caused cigarette smoke to billow out, revealing many men with scars across their faces.</p><p><span style=""> In reality, however, it looked just like any other casino.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t this a place where I should be wearing a suit?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> People in uniform were busy wandering around the corridor.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk was wearing the leather jacket and skinny jeans that he purchased not long ago.&#xA0;</span>He gave off the feeling of a bad youth.</p><p><span style=""> &quot;Here it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> There was a large door guarded by two men in sunglasses.</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae coughed as he stood in front of the door.</span></p><p><span style=""> The guards deeply bowed.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Detective-nim, you came!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Shit, Don&#x2019;t call me detective here. Call me Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Yes, Hyung-nim!&quot;</span></p><p><span style=""> They knew Park Jung-bae, so they opened the door without any fuss.</span></p><p><span style=""> They passed through the door to the illegal casino.</span></p><p><span style=""> There were dozens of tables with dealers handing out cards. At first glance, there seemed to be over 50 people spending enormous amounts of money.&#xA0;</span>There were piles of money in front of the people, the total amount that circulated throughout the building amounting to over one billion won.</p><p><span style=""> It was gambling at a colossal scale.&#xA0;</span>Nobody cared about the appearance of new people, as they were too busy concentrating on their own hands.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style=""> How much of that money was used on bribes?</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;A recipient of those bribes is right beside me.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae was one of the police officers who received bribes from SY.</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk saw a familiar face among the dealers.</span></p><p><span style=""> &apos;During the day, he does illegal collection. At night, he is a dealer in a casino. He jumps well between jobs.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> It was the person who intimidated Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won saw Park Jung-bae and came running over.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Uh, Detective Park! I told you not to come here. It is like decreasing the price of baby formula! I said I would contact you through our phones.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The people nearby murmured the moment they heard the word &#x2018;detective.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won exclaimed to them.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Haha, don&#x2019;t worry. He is someone watching behind us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won&#x2019;s words implied that the detective was a dog that he had raised himself.&#xA0;</span>The people started to play the game again like they understood.</p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ah. Chief Han. You don&#x2019;t need to go to so much effort. Today I just came to play for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Haha! Detective is too big for this. It is like going to one of the 100 won Go-Stop places in the neighbourhood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Park Jung-bae tapped the head of Tae-hyuk who was next to him.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;No, today he will be playing. I came to watch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Hrmm? No, you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won noticed the presence of an uninvited guest and looked at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Chief Han Sang-won. You are busy day and night.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Ah! You! Haha! I don&#x2019;t know why you came here. Did you want to win a jackpot to pay off your debt?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk laughed and replied.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;I hope to give you that much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won laughed at his words. Then he whispered in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s ears.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;No. This isn&#x2019;t a playground for kids. If you want to find a place for one million~two million won then I will introduce you to some places. Well, you might end up stripped of your organs in the long term... When that happens, feel free to come to SY Capital. Didn&#x2019;t I give you my business card?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk quietly opened the box of vitamin drinks that he brought with him.&#xA0;</span>It was filled with 50,000 won bills.</p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won laughed as he saw it.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;This! You came with some money? Yes. Then please, feel free to jump in.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Han Sang-won guided Tae-hyuk and Park Jung-bae to a table.</span></p><p><span style=""> The dealer and a few guests were playing poker.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Hey. Let him play. He is surprisingly rich.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I understand, Hyung-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk sat at the table and the dealer started to play the hand.</span></p><p><span style=""> He took out a set of cards and shuffled them.&#xA0;</span>At that moment, Tae-hyuk noticed that the dealer took something out.</p><p><span style=""> &apos;From the very beginning?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> The intent of his actions was clear.</span></p><p><span style=""> It was to let Tae-hyuk win recklessly in the beginning. </span>At first, even if a person got a good hand, they wouldn&#x2019;t raise such high stakes. That would only happen after winning a few times. After they upped the ante, the dealer would manipulate the draw to suck away all of their money. The evidence of this was that most of the tables were lamenting more than cheering with victory.</p><p><span style=""> The odds were overwhelmingly high for the dealer&#x2019;s side.&#xA0;</span>Many of them were professional scammers prepared by SY Capital.</p><p><span style=""> Tae-hyuk realized that this was an illegal casino and was prepared to deal with the cheating dealers.</span></p><p><span style=""> He received a notification of a new crime skill.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Brr!</span></i></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;Good!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Gambling has been learnt.]</span></p><p><span style=""> -You will become a dishonest gambler.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss as he saw the words on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;W-What? This description...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style=""> The contents were simple and easy to understand.</span></p><p><span style=""> The dealer said.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Guest-nim. Do you know Seven Card Stud Poker?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> Seven Card Stud Poker was a type of card game played with seven cards.</span></p><p><span style=""> First, he would receive three cards and would reveal one card.&#xA0;</span>Every time he received an additional card, he would have to make a bet.</p><p><span style=""> Basically, except for the first two cards and the last hidden one, all the cards would be revealed.</span></p><p><span style=""> Due to this, it was a game filled with various bluffs and psychological warfare.</span></p><p><span style=""> &quot;Of course. I bought the book yesterday and studied hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;... Haha, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> The dealer and other guests laughed.</span></p><p><span style=""> Well, he did have the face of a beginner.</span></p><p><span style=""> But after a while, he became the king of this casino.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
