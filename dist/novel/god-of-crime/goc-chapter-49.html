<p><span style="">Chapter 49: The Family&#x2019;s Condition #5</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk circled around the Death Circus and explained each of the attractions to An Eun-jeong one by one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rules of the death game, spoken in a calm and cool voice, were imprinted into Eun-jeong&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">The next place that they arrived at was a pool filled with water up to the knees.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a cylindrical shaped cushion floating on the water. Perhaps this is an attraction where we have to make it to the other side.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the sign and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If successful, we will be awarded 30 million won. By the way, the liquid underneath is hydrochloric acid. If a person slips, then their bones will melt. But the worst thing is that the hydrochloric acid isn&#x2019;t very deep. It isn&#x2019;t enough to cause instant death. You will have to endure a few minutes where your feet is melting. The name of the attraction is the Bridge of Pain... Doesn&#x2019;t the name really match?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a method that frequently appeared on TV entertainment programs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The red stain spreading in the hydrochloric acid looked like strawberry syrup.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was also a lump floating in one corner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke as he pointed to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like one challenger has already failed. Still, I think that this attraction has a better return on time than others. We are wasting money by just looking around. Why don&#x2019;t you try it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I-I can&#x2019;t! How can I do that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Other attractions would only cause a loss of money if they failed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even it it hurt, there wasn&#x2019;t a 100% chance of dying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the Bridge of Pain would cause death if she didn&#x2019;t recover instantly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the appearance of the red syrup and lump of flesh turned her off from the attraction.</span></p><p><span style="">30 million won could only be obtained from taking such risks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was reminded of entertainment programs again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An obstacle was placed on an ordinary pool and the contestant had to cross to the other side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the contestant fell, then they would only get wet.</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, the success rate wasn&#x2019;t that high.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among them, the most difficult thing to run on was a cylinder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other forms, they could grab onto the cushion if they lost their balance and fell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the cylindrical cushion was different. They would literally turn over and hit the water.</span></p><p><span style="">Falling meant death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to take one step in this situation, even if the person was strong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moreover, this wasn&#x2019;t the end.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the large fan that was installed in the middle of the pool.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was off now, but it was ready to operate at any time.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;In the first place, the Bridge of Pain is an attraction that can never be cleared.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">After seeing one failure, there wouldn&#x2019;t be anyone who could easily challenge this.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew how Kim Joon-young would take advantage of this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Death Circus had a closing time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that time, those who collected close to the amount of escape might rarely come out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they collected 20~30 million won each time, then they would eventually get 200 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there wasn&#x2019;t enough time to play the games.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then this bridge would become the temptation for them to get enough money for freedom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was just like a gun loaded with bullets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The participants inevitably put their feet on the bridge, and once they started crossing...</span></p><p><span style="">The result was that more strawberry syrup would be added to the pool.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s go to the next attraction.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong grabbed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s collar as he walked forward.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t speak properly after such a great shock.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I-I&#x2019;m so...rry. &#xA0;T-Take a break for a moment...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is still a lot to see. Time is also money. As you can see, most of the attractions engender conflict between people. It is better to move as much as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no time to waste.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong replied in a squeamish voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I can barely move. 10 minutes... no, just five minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then we will take a break for five minutes and look around again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He saw a place where they could take a break.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were chairs and a table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Next to it was a vending machine.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&#x2019;ll get a drink...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would strongly recommend that you don&#x2019;t drink anything here, despite being thirsty. Devices are prepared. There is a possibility that you might ingest something strange.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong bit her lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She remembered the tea and sweets she ate before coming here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what I ate...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. It is possible. But you were the one who made the choice. I guess this is the big price you have to pay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong couldn&#x2019;t answer and looked down at the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A small sob was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the crying Eun-jeong with cold eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the one who would drive Ha-ran to ruin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was also due to the bad multilevel company Tiwai International and the Death Circus organized by Producer Kim Joon-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this didn&#x2019;t mean that An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s sins had disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had already pulled several people into the multilevel company.</span></p><p><span style="">If he had to say some harsh words...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every person needed to be accountable for their choices.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong had signed up for the Death Circus, and now she was paying for it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But she still had something left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The sin of bringing in innocent people to the multilevel scheme.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was something that couldn&#x2019;t be easily repaid.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Noona should know how many people suffered from her mistakes. How many people did you bring into this company? They will all meet ends like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...I-I&apos;m sorry. I am really sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong couldn&#x2019;t raise her head and started to apologize.</span></p><p><span style="">He lost his appetite.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was the enemy who drove Seo Ha-ran to ruin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would rather hate her and act like she was a criminal, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case.</span></p><p><span style="">She was also a victim of the system.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t forgive her but he decided not to blame her.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wanted to confirm one thing with Eun-jeong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the reason why she had joined Tiwai International.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, why did you need so much money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong was lost in thought for a moment and didn&#x2019;t say anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then all of a sudden, she started talking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a younger sister and there is a distinct gap between us. I prefer to play around without much interest in studying, while she is an example of a perfect student. She always got first place since elementary school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had a younger sister who was a model student.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong had a huge inferiority complex towards her sister.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My dad told me to marry quickly since I can&#x2019;t do anything else. He engaged me to a promising doctor... In the end, I couldn&#x2019;t bear it, so I ran away. But... But... I found out that my mother had leukemia. I wanted to be recognized. I wanted her to be proud of her daughter at least once before she died. Not the stupid daughter who ran away...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong&#x2019;s voice trailed off and she slowly started to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eun-jeong wanted to be recognized as family?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;m sorry. They seem to think a little differently.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong lowered her face with a really pained expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words didn&#x2019;t end there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, I came here as a favor to someone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;F-Favour?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Someone asked me to rescue Eun-jeong from here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Who...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;To be exact, it was your younger sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes widened as she realized who sent Tae-hyuk to this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The conditions for being a family? Is there such a thing? It doesn&#x2019;t matter how wrong you were, nor how bad you are now. You are still family. Stop being a fool and come back soon.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she muttered in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-young... I&#x2019;m sorry...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is the shock therapy over?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed and patted Eun-jeong&#x2019;s hair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What would she look like if her sister was actually in front of her?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He tried to imagine such a ridiculous thing, but it wasn&#x2019;t over yet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, rather, it was starting now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The melodrama has now ended. Anyway, so far we&#x2019;ve looked at roughly 70% of the attractions. You must have come to the conclusion that you can&#x2019;t get out of here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is just like human chess. If you lose, then you will lose a corresponding body part. If you are lucky and win consecutively, you&#x2019;ll only lose an arm or an eye. You don&#x2019;t want to leave here like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what can I do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From now on, Eun-jeong will have to entrust me with your money and life. If you don&#x2019;t like it, then you can move on your own.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong bit her lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a proposal that wasn&#x2019;t easy to accept.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But what is your relationship with my younger sister?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. She was gracious enough to change my fate. That is all I will tell you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had become a model student because of An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong fell deep into thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She seemed to be debating on whether she should believe the stranger in front of her or not.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk waited until she answered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the proposal was accepted then she would become a chess piece that could be used at will.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I accept. I&#x2019;ll give you everything. So... Please take me to my sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then the contract is established.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But is there a way to get out of here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and started to slowly explain his plans.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes opened wider as she listened to his words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That isn&#x2019;t possible!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was really ridiculous.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Cha Soo-hyun was looking around the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">He understood the rules of this place better than any other participant.</span></p><p><span style="">A variety of attractions existed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were two major types.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Apart from completing some missions with given conditions, there was the PvP format where two people competed to take the opponent&#x2019;s money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, there was a high percentage of the latter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, the missions were fatal if there was even a small error. Only fools would be deceived by such things.</span></p><p><span style="">Cha Soo-hyun was a survivor, despite the survival rate being close to zero.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He received a platinum membership card, but he wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had realized the pleasure of killing others.</span></p><p><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be done outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was possible here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, he could also get extra income.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could earn more than 200 million overnight.</span></p><p><span style="">This was already the third time that Cha Soo-hyun had participated in the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he had to change his face by using a simple cosmetic surgery, because he couldn&#x2019;t reveal his identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only a few in Tiwai were aware of this fact.</span></p><p><span style="">He would kill 10 people tonight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their lives would be worth 500 million.</span></p><p><span style="">Cha Soo-hyun had already eaten two people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he had to find the next prey.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he found some cute rabbits hiding near the Bridge of Pain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A man and a woman.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman looked like she would be a tasty kill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, they seemed scared to challenge the attractions.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, the man...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Was he in his early 20s?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had bushy hair and a leather jacket. He seemed like a neighbourhood bum.</span></p><p><span style="">Looking at the nameplate on their chests, he was surprised to see that both of them had stayed above 50 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">Cha Soo-hyun licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he approached them with a face that was as innocent as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is too much. It really is a crazy game... I don&#x2019;t think I was in my right mind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman asked. The man just yawned with a blank face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I am Cha Soo-hyun. Haven&#x2019;t you tried any of the attractions yet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... So what?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was looking for someone like that. I know a strategy where three people can win more than 50 million won. How about it? Do you want to cooperate and survive this crazy game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman tilted her head with confusion. Her expression was unsure.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the yawning man opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh. I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like this man was the one who made the decisions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? It&#x2019;s a surefire win. Really appetizing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cha Soo-hyun laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">The opponent was already halfway there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now all he had to do was eat.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
