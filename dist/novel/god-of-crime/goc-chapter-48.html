<p><span style="">Chapter 48: The Family&#x2019;s Condition #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Eun-jeong were guided to a VIP room by Choi Sung-yeol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sitting in the lavishly decorated room was a middle aged man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Producer...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young looked like an ordinary man with a good style.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wore a neat, tailored suit, and had cropped hair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had the atmosphere of a high income professional.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was actually the criminal responsible for the production and distribution of dangerous videos for nearly 10 years.</span></p><p><span style="">His main product was snuff films, showing brutal murder scenes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He showed a wide variety of people being killed in order to earn a profit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The terrifying thing about Kim Joon-young was that he did nothing but prepare the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made many murder videos without getting his hands dirty.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a limit to the profit he could get from snuff videos.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People eventually wanted a stronger stimulus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People quickly got tired of the videos of people being brutally killed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there were rumours that he was being targeted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></p><p><span style="">So Kim Joon-young started the &#x2018;Death Circus&#x2019; business.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a game where people risked their lives in extreme situations.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People watched in real time through magic windows or surveillance cameras.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a recorded video -- the situation was actually happening in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a tremendous sensation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Domestic as well as foreign conglomerates swarmed to the market, causing entry tickets to soar to hundreds of millions of won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only problem was that the survival rate was close to zero, decreasing the participants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, he needed to find new participants each time the Death Circus happened, but that wasn&#x2019;t easy.</span></p><p><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol then appeared with the multilevel company, Tiwai International.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The multilevel scheme sucked out the blood marrow from the members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After being driven to their limit, they would be entered into the Death Circus and forced to play a game with their lives on the line.</span></p><p><span style="">The two criminals created such a devilish system, and approximately seven years from now...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol and Kim Joon-young were arrested and sentenced in accordance to the federal laws.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the system they created continued, and there was an endless number of victims.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps Seo Ha-ran...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This incident didn&#x2019;t end with simply catching the criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to destroy the very system they created.</span></p><p><span style="">Just before sitting down, Tae-hyuk sent a message to somebody.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The stage where the Death Circus was held didn&#x2019;t allow radio waves in or out. Therefore, all his preparations needed to be completed before entering.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-jeong sat down as tea and refreshments were placed in front of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first glance, the food looked luxurious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t touch it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young quietly observed the two people before opening his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hello. I&apos;ve heard that you want to join the Death Circus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk answered while secretly sending messages on his smartphone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Next, it was An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s turn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She asked the most important thing for her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it really true that I can leap to platinum rating in one go if I participate?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. In addition, if you are lucky enough, then you can make an unimaginable amount of money overnight.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it is a little dangerous. But if you survive, you can earn a huge amount of money. In theory, assuming that you win all the games, you can earn approximately three billion won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an enormous amount of money that could change a person&#x2019;s life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong drank the tea with a rapt expression as Kim Joon-young said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are called Lee Cheol-su. Won&#x2019;t you have some?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I ate some bad lunch so it hurts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then that is serious. Now that you pledged to participate in the Death Circus, you won&#x2019;t be able to get out of here. Should I ask for some medication to be brought over?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s words were obvious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head and replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is okay. I will be fine after some rest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I&apos;m glad. Then let&#x2019;s talk about contracts. Please look at this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young pulled out two pieces of paper from a bag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He seemed to be in a good mood.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Cheol-su and An Eun-jeong were lively young people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Those who participated in the Death Circus were in such a serious crisis that they wanted to commit suicide.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their spirits were likely to be dead before participating in the game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A desire to live needed to be ignited.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this wasn&#x2019;t necessary for these two.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s appearance was quite good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The customers would be satisfied if a girl like her screamed in pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe tonight, he would be able to get a record level of revenue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s eyes shone with greed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the piece of paper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In summary, it was a &#x2018;body waiver.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">Those who participated in the Death Circus didn&#x2019;t receive any legal protection.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tiwai had the rights to the corpses.</span></p><p><span style="">It was ridiculous enough to be unreasonable.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the most part, the ones signing this were able to die anyway so it was their last gamble.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong had already signed it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed and wrote down Lee Cheol-su.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young made a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The details can be seen after entering the Death Circus. Good luck on receiving a jackpot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young laughed as the two participants left to join the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tonight there were more participants than usual.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, the two people who entered...</span></p><p><span style="">The female was an employee of Tiwai International.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young would have eventually convinced her to join the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had expected it to take 10 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He remembered thinking that she was a girl who would have a lot of value in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a little quicker than expected, so tonight would be heated up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A young girl crying in pain was the best entertainment.</span></p><p><span style="">But the man was unusual.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is called Lee Cheol-su?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t an employee of Tiwai, but he seemed to be familiar with the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps he was a puppet prepared by one of the guests.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t unwelcome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">He contacted some people and told them to pay attention to Lee Cheol-su.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first glance, the system of the Death Group seemed very fair.</span></p><p><span style="">Win money or lose your lives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this was just the stage that Kim Joon-young prepared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were numerous traps for the participants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Tiwai would have the last laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young sat on a chair and watched the monitors. It showed all of the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All he needed to do was relax and enjoy it.</span></p><p><span style="">There were numerous attractions and traps that were impossible to survive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible even for a god.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young was certain.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">A man in a black suit guided Tae-hyuk and Eun-jeong somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">The building had a labyrinth-like structure.</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong&#x2019;s face had turned pale.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What am I doing...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She seemed to have realized that she had signed a waiver form, and that she couldn&#x2019;t run away from here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only way to escape was to clear all the attractions, and use 200 million to purchase a platinum certificate.</span></p><p><span style="">The guide said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once again, I&#x2019;ll explain the rules. All participants will receive 50 million won by default. The value of life... You can think of it as that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man explained while walking down the passage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And An Eun-jeong, you have shares in Tiwai International. That money will be given as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s expression brightened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The shares are obviously worth 100 million... So I will have that in addition to the 50 million?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man in the black suit shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. Ahn Eun-Jung&apos;s share is worth roughly 15 million won. The rest has been distributed to the upper ranks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? T-That is ridiculous! I definitely bought 100 million in shares!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Have you forgotten that a portion of the shares would be transferred to the upper ranks?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That&apos;s right...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If she recruited new members, then a portion of their money would be hers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most people only thought about that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t notice that her own shares would also be taken.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk listened to the conversation between the man and An Eun-jeong.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;85% was taken from the beginning. You really evil bastards.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It meant that the members absolutely couldn&#x2019;t climb up from silver rank.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would undergo the pain forever, and would eventually be forced to participate in the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">The man stood in front of a firmly closed iron gate and contacted someone through a radio.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then there was a lumbering sound as the door opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We have now arrived. My role ends here. I wish you will obtain a jackpot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The black suited man bowed and disappeared back the way they came.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;U-Uh...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong made a confused expression as she looked inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A game of life or death. She had imagined a dark basement place guarded by many men.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the interior was completely unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="">It was almost like...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An amusement park?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were mascot dolls wandering around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also a few rides scattered here and there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Isn&#x2019;t this better than I thought?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="">They looked like ordinary attractions, but she still didn&#x2019;t know the horror of this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As the two of them entered, a mascot doll came up and gave them badges.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed and accepted it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now it will really start.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once he placed in on his chest, the badge showed the number 50.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that his current money was 50 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just place it on the chest?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong copied him and the number 65 appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">The two people entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then an announcement was heard.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Since there are two new entrants, I will explain it once again.</span></i> <i><span style="">Your e-money will be reduced by 10 every hour.</span></i> <i><span style="">Once it reaches zero, you will be automatically eliminated, so please be careful.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I hope you hit the jackpot!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Elimination meant death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there was a 10 million won fee every hour.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was ridiculous.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk tugged the hand of the despairing An Eun-jeong.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are some people playing Pirate Roulette over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed to a place that was slightly far away.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two people playing a pirate game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a pirate in the barrel, and people would insert their knives in order.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The winner would be the one who caused the pirate to pop out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The barrel was made large enough for someone to enter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man inside had a pale white face as he bit his lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person holding the knife outside was hesitating about which hole to insert it into.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 10 attractions in this place. </span><span style="">Each one had a sign explaining how to play them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong read the sign for Pirate Roulette.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After entering, three knives must be inserted before leaving. If successful, you will be paid 10 million won. You can gain an additional 10 million won for each successive win. If you fail, then the money of the person with the knife will be recovered. Umm... There are nine holes in total. Take a good position. If your position isn&#x2019;t good then you might end up stabbed in the arms or legs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. Is it like that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man holding the knife shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;J-Just one more and it will be 90 million won! I&apos;m sorry but just one more...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man inside the barrel shrieked, but the man holding the knife didn&#x2019;t stop.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The knife entered the barrel and blood emerged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong covered her mouth with both hands as she watched.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the 4th failure... he has no luck.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Failure? He was successful in one thing. The person inside didn&#x2019;t die yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? B-But the knife!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Only one out of the nine holes doesn&#x2019;t have a knife device installed. Any hole would stab the person inside with a knife. How could he survive so many stab wounds? This is the Pirate Roulette you are watching right now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk explained in a calm voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the information was bloody.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;... R-Ridiculous, n-no... How is this...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong sat down on the spot. From now on, the games they would have to play were far crazier.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then let&#x2019;s go to the next attraction.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He pulled Eun-jeong up and walked to the next attraction.</span></p><p><span style="">Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a crazy amusement park where those who entered would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was systematically impossible to survive here.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Seo Tae-hyuk was different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was certain of victory.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
