<p><span style="">Chapter 125 - Swallow the Sun #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;This atmosphere is...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo looked around with an impressed expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As they walked down the corridor, most of the building had modern architecture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, once the door opened, an amazing scene greeted them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a palace from the Joseon Dynasty.</span></p><p><span style="">There was an altar with a thin curtain covering it, while the followers were lined up on either side.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Welcome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Two bishops, wearing the traditional clothing of officials, greeted them with benevolent expressions. &#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Chi-hyun introduced them first.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The two people before you are Pungbaek and Unsa.&#x201D; (Two of Hwanin&#x2019;s 3,000 followers. Pungbaek=earl of the wind. Unsa=master of the clouds)</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo cried out at the familiar names,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That means you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I am Usa.&#x201D; (Another follower. Master of the rain)</span></p><p><span style="">They were three people from the Dangun myth. (See the Hwanin link)&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were natural titles based on the leader of the church being called Hwanin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, someone&#x2019;s voice was heard from among the silent followers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oppa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo stared at the other person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was wearing court clothing, but he was sure that she was his sister.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, this brat! What are you doing here?! Do you know how worried I have been?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What...? I have become one of the seven fairies who serve Hwanin. More than that, Oppa. Listen. Hwanin is really great...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the brother and sister reunited, Tae-hyuk looked at the shadow beyond the curtain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was Cho Min-hyuk, the leader of &#x2018;Sun.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;No, isn&#x2019;t he called Hwanin here? However, this scent is clearly...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There were a few incense burners placed around the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A slightly sweet aroma was coming from them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the incense that Choi Sung-yeol used to blur the mind.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is diluted since my stats aren&#x2019;t falling as drastically as the last time it happened. However, it certainly looks like his judgement is declining.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo&#x2019;s eyes were drooping and the mental strength of a soldier couldn&#x2019;t be seen.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The Yakuza made this? It has a crazy effect...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the cause of the blind devotion among the followers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The interior decorations and gorgeous garments that seemed to come from a historical drama set were meant to hide it.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo was perfectly drunk on the scent.</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, he never forgot his purpose for coming here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough! Anyway, I will be taking my sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I mean, I&#x2019;m not going! I will continue staying here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Min-young&#x2019;s voice was small compared to her brother, who seemed like he would burst on fire at any moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He grabbed her hand to drag her out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the watching bishops didn&#x2019;t say anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like they had expected this and were waiting for something.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized that the shadow behind the curtain had started swaying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is starting.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As if it was waiting, a strange voice flowed from behind the curtain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee Gun-woo. Your sister is tied up by karma. If you bring her out of here, then she will lose her life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fury filled Lee Gun-woo&#x2019;s eyes at the words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how he scolded her, she was still his sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t allow any threats to her life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. You&#x2019;ve finally exposed your true colours! I think I know how you scammed Min-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Min-young. Ignore his words.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo pulled his sister&#x2019;s hand and tried to leave the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He thought that his little sister probably told them his personal information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Lee Min-young&#x2019;s condition was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She desperately tried to persuade Lee Gun-woo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Oppa, you are misunderstanding. Hwanin&#x2019;s words are all true.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? What is it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader whispered in a low voice towards the confused Lee Gun-woo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee Gun-woo. The same applies to you. You are also tied up by karma.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo started shouting,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is like I told my sister! Who would fall for such tricks?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the leader spoke like he was giving a prophecy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you struggling because of the distorted future?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyone can say that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it would be nice to speak a little more clearly. Captain Lee Gun-woo and Private Park&#xA0;</span><span style="">Woo-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo stopped moving with a shocked expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He seemed like a stone.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the surprised Lee Min-young asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oppa? What is it? What does Hwanin mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t make sense.</span></p><p><span style="">How did that person...?</span></p><p><span style="">The accident that occurred six months ago appeared in Lee Gun-woo&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was treated as confidential, and his name didn&#x2019;t even appear in the newspapers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, he didn&#x2019;t even inform his family.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But that name emerged from that person&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk tsk. Have you realized your ignorance? But don&#x2019;t worry. The sins committed are also part of the cleansing. It is my role to remedy that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Gun-woo bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">He was originally scheduled to be promoted to major.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt he was doing well and couldn&#x2019;t be touched as he lived at headquarters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was a huge mistake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Lee Gun-woo ignored the harsh abuse that was happening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The victim, Park Woo-hyuk, couldn&#x2019;t endure it anymore and committed suicide through a grenade in his barrack.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the time, there were four other soldiers present and they also lost their lives.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a big enough event for the unit itself to be dismantled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Lee Gun-woo could&#x2019;ve stopped it if he paid more attention to the team.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, his promotion disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was barely able to avoid a dishonourable discharge due to his history.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Your karma is the soldiers who died unjustly. An offering is necessary to purify it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Offering? Money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The answer came from a different place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa, Hwanin isn&#x2019;t interested in such things. He isn&#x2019;t a shaman who tricks people for money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what is the offering?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader stopped for a moment and beckoned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The believers moved and lit a few more incense burners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The scent became more widespread in the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The proof that you are still alive is enough. The clothes you wore, the bedding you sleep in, the shoes you wear. Offer them up in the cleansing ritual.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The words were convincing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the leader had asked for money, he wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it so easily.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the offerings were just keepsakes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Wouldn&#x2019;t it be okay to try it once?</span></p><p><span style="">Some time passed by.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The distressed Lee Gun-woo finally opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Cough. For Min-young&#x2019;s sake, I guess I can listen to your story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As long as you have the offerings, all the things necessary for the cleansing will be prepared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Min-young clapped happily at Gun-woo&#x2019;s response.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Right? I told you it wasn&#x2019;t fake. Hwanin is the real thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Gun-woo involuntarily nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun smiled at the sight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had been a long time since the play had been so perfectly completed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been scamming people for years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They used it to secure hundreds of believers, but this was the first time it was perfected.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t a chance of getting unknown information from outside.</span></p><p><span style="">It was true that money wasn&#x2019;t important.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As long as they gained the person&#x2019;s faith, they had obtained the life of that person.</span></p><p><span style="">Now Pungbaek and Unsa would put the finishing touches on the scam.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the remaining person...</span></p><p><span style="">Song Chi-hyun looked at the man who came with Lee Gun-woo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a high school maths teacher.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was the only information they got.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this was enough for today.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A believer&#x2019;s family member had been brought in to Sun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In most cases, the remaining family members would also follow.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk, who had been quietly watching the situation, slowly came forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lee Gun-woo. Can you please wait a moment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I still haven&#x2019;t achieved my purpose for coming here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everybody&#x2019;s gaze focused on Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Pungbaek and Unsa frowned at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">They were still a little immature compared to Song Chi-hyun, whose poker face was perfect.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t Kim Cheol-su come to find your little brother? Hwanin said that he couldn&#x2019;t find him. &#x2018;Kim Sung-soo&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">According to the information obtained, his little brother Kim Sung-soo wasn&#x2019;t here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He probably got caught by some other cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This person had found the wrong address.</span></p><p><span style="">Just in case, Song Chi-hyun had thought of some measures about his brother&#x2019;s whereabouts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It could be used to fool him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I didn&#x2019;t come here to find my little brother. I thought I should destroy the man who is tricking my followers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">He could use the fact that his opponent proclaimed himself a god.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among those gathered here, only five people knew that this church was a scam.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rest were followed and really believed they were following a god.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the most effective way to use that...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk activated a crime skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Disguise has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Your appearance has changed to Song Chi-hyun.</span></p><p><span style="">In an instant, Tae-hyuk&apos;s face changed into another person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people who saw it shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Whatttttt!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;F-Face, his face changed!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are two Usa&#x2019;s!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The shadow behind the curtain shook like he was also confused.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used a crime skill before opening his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">Now his voice was dignified.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Unsa! How dare you use the name of Hwanin!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am Pungbaek. I received the name from Hwanin and brought rain to the world when I followed Hwanung!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;O-Oh my god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plan was very simple.</span></p><p><span style="">Reveal the true colors of the one pretending to be a god.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
