<p><span style="">Chapter 22 - Criminals #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Unlike the bloody atmosphere it was conducted in, the talk proceeded rather smoothly.</span></p><p><span style="">Besides, Moonlight Flower was a surprisingly good help.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Joking around with Big Mama...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The image of the Big Mama that Tae-hyuk knew was like the difference between heaven and earth.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">She built up her skills while working as a stolen goods broker, before entering the counterfeit art industry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like now was that time.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Still, her ability to make counterfeit goods is already huge.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was painting a copy of something. In Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes, it was hard to distinguish between the original and the fake.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes lit up.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower had disappeared into the warehouse in order to find a stick to use. </span></p><p><span style="">This was his chance.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk organized the information he had about Big Mama in his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The details had been written down in his blacklist, but he was still able to come up with some important points on the spot. </span></p><p><span style="">He remembered something very unusual. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, Kid. What did you need?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama asked with the smile of a salesperson.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello, I am Seo Tae-hyuk. There are many rumors about Mama. It is an honor to meet you. Then, I&#x2019;ll speak bluntly. I want to make a deal with Mama.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama made a surprised expression while her eyes sharpened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. You aren&#x2019;t an ordinary kid.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you always saying that the appearance on the outside isn&#x2019;t important?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... You know me very well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are famous.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What type of deal do you want to establish?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She wanted to know what he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had no intention of showing all the cards in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you happen to know the thief who stole an item called the Rosario in this neighbourhood yesterday? The appearance looks roughly like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk showed a picture of Rosario that he drew in advance.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama replied in a relaxed tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I trade in many stolen goods in one day, and I can&#x2019;t remember all of it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know that Mama has such a good memory that Mama can even remember a piece of merchandise from a week ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was famous for her tremendous memory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. Not many people know about my specialty... You are a kid that I really can&#x2019;t look down on. No, shall I call you Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The title coming from Big Mama&#x2019;s mouth changed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew what that meant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would like to deal in information. If you give me information about the thief who took Rosario, then I will give you one piece of information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will listen first and decide.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke casually, as if he was ordering jajangmyeon from a Chinese restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Trail of the Sunset.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like time had stopped. </span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama froze.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... How do you...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two implications.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled gently. </span></p><p><span style="">He said it because he knew the future of Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a piece that all art collectors desire.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&#x2019;s hand trembled in response.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an expression like she had been hit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is very important that the information is reliable. There is no guarantee that you won&#x2019;t lie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew that Big Mama would say this. The answer was also prepared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you in a position to look through straws right now? If my information is unbelievable, then it can&#x2019;t be helped. I will give up on the deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said boldly. If the box wasn&#x2019;t opened, then the person wouldn&#x2019;t know if they had received what they ordered from the Chinese restaurant. Of course, it was the same for the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the risk with trading information.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk is telling me to betray the money making game. Do you know that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Trail of the Sunset, or money. Select one of the two.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no need to even weigh it. No matter how many ping pong balls were stacked up, they still wouldn&#x2019;t be able to beat a bowling ball.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was still smiling, but her eyes were burning with a strange fire.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you are lying then be ready, for I will give you a very painful punishment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, I&#x2019;ll tell you the location of the painting. Mama, please tell me the name and phone number of the person I am looking for.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama said to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t gamble, but I will try to believe Tae-hyuk just once. The thief...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was able to get the information he desired by trading with Big Mama.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you going to do now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to make a trap that he can&#x2019;t run from, so I will have to prepare something to tempt him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahum~&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower spoke in a strange tone and laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke in an apologetic voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I&#x2019;ll have to leave you here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah. You ate everything, and now you want to discard me like a used tissue?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. Instead, I promise to talk after catching K.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">K was the initial of the criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You promise?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower extended a finger.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;I will add one more thing. Go to the aquarium with me on the weekend sometime. There is something that I want to discuss with you there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Well. Ok, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This time, Tae-hyuk owed a big favor to Moonlight Flower, so he decided to listen to her request.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower continued waving until Tae-hyuk disappeared from her sight.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I never thought I would meet two blacklist members in one day.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower and Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like they were attracting each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were 120 people on the blacklist. It was impossible to think that he could go against all of them, even with his crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;First of all, I have to watch the situation...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">While Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t know much about Moonlight Flower, he knew that Big Mama was as sly like a fox.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it possible for him to leave her alone?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind became complicated. </span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Let&apos;s just think about catching K for now.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk dialled the number given by Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">The plan for catching K was already in place.</span></p><p><span style="">There were a few beeps.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The call was connected.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun didn&#x2019;t feel good in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how many days it had been since he had found something good.</span></p><p><span style="">Yesterday, he went to collect from a newly discovered prey. There was a family who recently moved into his area.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Usually, in such cases, there were large amounts of money in the owner&#x2019;s house.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were already diligent and entrusted it all to the bank, so he had to resort to taking various miscellaneous things around the house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t even a single gold ring.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun spat on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Che! Ara, you bastards.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to move on to another area, but the situation wasn&#x2019;t right.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe there was already someone else...</span></p><p><span style="">He pulled out a cigarette and put it in his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had just bought a new pack, but it was already the last one.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy. I have no cigarettes left.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was dangerous if he couldn&#x2019;t hit the jackpot.</span></p><p><span style="">He was enjoying his cigarette when the phone rang.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know the number.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps it was a spam call.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun suddenly came up with a good idea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would swear at the people on the phone to relieve stress.</span></p><p><span style="">Sang-hyun pressed the call button and brought the phone to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He first had to check who the person was. If it was someone he didn&#x2019;t know, then he would curse at them.</span></p><p><span style="">Sang-hyun concentrated on the other person&#x2019;s voice. </span></p><p><i><span style="">-Sang-hyun, it is Mother.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun couldn&apos;t believe his ears. Mama was calling him directly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, Mother. What&apos;s wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Well, I am calling because I thought I should bring something to your attention.</span></i> <i><span style="">Earlier, some kid was looking for you.</span></i> <i><span style="">I don&apos;t know who he is, but you ought to be careful.</span></i> <i><span style="">He asked about you.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;For me? What did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">How long have we been working together?</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course, I gave him the wrong number.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha... Thank you, Mother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He heard a soft laugh over the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Well, there is a fee for the information.&#x201D;</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She wouldn&#x2019;t hand over false information for free.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun felt sweat flowing, as Mama wasn&#x2019;t just a simple stolen goods broker.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I know what you are thinking.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;m Mama, I&#x2019;m not that cold.</span></i> <i><span style="">I got free income thanks to Sang-hyun.</span></i> <i><span style="">Sang-hyun should also receive a prize.</span></i> <i><span style="">I received some very good information, so</span></i> <i><span style="">how about it?</span></i> <i><span style="">Do you want to give it a try?</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Kim Sang-hyun wanted to cheer.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a great opportunity for thieves. A place that held a lot of valuables.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I accept! No, I will do it! Please let me do it!&quot;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Hoho!</span></i> <i><span style="">I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">Indeed, Sang-hyun.</span></i> <i><span style="">You are dependable.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Stolen goods brokers often handed over information.</span></p><p><span style="">If so, there was an implicit rule when doing business with that person.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun barely refrained from laughing.</span></p><p><span style="">Mama&#x2019;s spot was rumored to be a jackpot.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what should I steal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-There will be lots of diamonds.</span></i> <i><span style="">Please help Mama steal all of them.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Just believe in me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun combed through the information given by Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">Diamonds?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hahaha! I will be rich! Rich!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">The spot wasn&#x2019;t far away.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun did a final equipment check. HIs equipment variety ranged from locksmith tools to levers for lifting heavy objects.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like he was going to rob a bank, not a house.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then... This isn&#x2019;t my area. Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He came here under the name of the greatest information broker, Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the owner of the territory wouldn&#x2019;t be able to have any complaints.</span></p><p><span style="">The spot was a two-storey house with a spacious courtyard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In recent years, expensive security systems were often found in homes like these.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was really hard to eat and live in this world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It doesn&#x2019;t look like there is one common CCTV. A big jackpot!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun cheered.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected from Mama. He wondered how she found information about this spot.</span></p><p><span style="">It was late at night, so there was no one in the house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fireplace was turned off, and no loud sounds could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">A golden opportunity to steal!</span></p><p><span style="">The hum of a song came out.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun was a thief with considerable skill. He was even able to get into a safety deposit box in five minutes because he was the child of a locksmith.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened a locked door using his skills.</span></p><p><span style="">According to Mama&#x2019;s information, the diamonds were in the bedroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He walked towards the destination while visualizing the structure of the house in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Here!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun excitedly opened the door.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Pang!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Pang pang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, there were the sounds of firecrackers popping.</span></p><p><span style="">The dark room lit up.</span></p><p><span style="">The people hiding in the darkness cheered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Surprise~!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Congratulations!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Happy birthday, Chief-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Chief-nim, I love you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Milk-coloured Chief-nim!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun stopped moving.</span></p><p><span style="">Diamonds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were a lot of diamonds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Three representative diamonds.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kim Sun-kyung. No matter how much we look, isn&#x2019;t that not the chief?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The second diamond answered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A diamond was a diamond, but they weren&#x2019;t jewels.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they were covered with diamonds.</span></p><p><span style="">Inside the room, dozens of people were dressed in police uniforms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the center of the room was a large cake, as well as beer and chicken.</span></p><p><span style="">Surprise? Birthday? What the hell?!&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the chief of police&#x2019;s house?</span></p><p><span style="">Why did Mama send him here...?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">Police!</span></p><p><span style="">The police!</span></p><p><span style="">Policeeeeee!</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun tried to flee back the way he came.</span></p><p><span style="">The diamond said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is this? Kim Sang-hyun! Did you come to surrender yourself for Chief-nim&#x2019;s birthday?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Today was the police chief&#x2019;s birthday.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Sang-hyun had to sing a congratulatory song in handcuffs.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
