<p><span style="">Chapter 117 - The Price of their Sins #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck, give me some medicine...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Joon-shik was kind enough to take Park Sung-yul to the infirmary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Blue Dragon Prison was a large correctional facility for hundreds of people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In such places, certain facilities and staff like medical officers were mandatory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, doctors were unlikely to work in prisons on remote islands.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, there was only one primary doctor working.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were no nurses.</span></p><p><span style="">The only doctor here said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, no dangerous areas were hurt. However, I will tell the warden that you need to be hospitalized for a period of time.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Then Doctor, do you know why the prison is so loud right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It feels like an explosion. At first, I was nervous because I thought patients would come flocking. But you are the first visitor. If so, hadn&#x2019;t it ended without any casualties? Ah, I have to stitch this up so stop moving. Stay put.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul looked around at the doctor&#x2019;s words. Certainly, he was the only patient in here.</span></p><p><span style="">A war was taking place between the prisoners and guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if there were no guns, it was strange that not a single person came here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant there was no armed conflict between the two groups.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe it was related to the explosion just before...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I don&apos;t know. No matter how crazy they are, would the rebels hit this place? Ugh... Worrying about it unnecessarily just hurt my wounds. I&apos;m sorry Doctor. Can I have a painkiller?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, wait a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The doctor injected a painkiller into Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s arm after he complained of pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Park Sung-yul could breathe more easily.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul leaned back on the bed and thought about the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why did a subordinate of Shin Chang-ho torture him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he had to confess everything because he was in such pain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Damn, he won&#x2019;t tell the police right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That would undo all the work he put into creating the puzzles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Sung-yul was worried about more than just his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He gained a sense of superiority and conquest from killing someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an exhilarating pleasure that couldn&#x2019;t be explained in words.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t feel that anymore thanks to one detective.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt like a young child who had his toy stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I found something new.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the puzzles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was moderately smart.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With the exception of the 14th murder, he had killed 13 people without the world knowing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would make them into puzzles and present them to the detective who caught him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was the beginning of the murder puzzle.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul would become the man controlling the detectives from the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was different from others.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was playing a game with the police while locked in prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just thinking about that gave him a sense of superiority and conquest.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul suddenly laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t feel any pain anymore, whether it was due to the medicine, or his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know why the enemy struck.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he had known, then he wouldn&#x2019;t have begged in such a way.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Park Joon-shik will regret making me his enemy. I am someone who is playing the country&#x2019;s detectives...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, the door opened and a group of criminals entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, Park Sung-yul! It has been a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He spoke in a friendly tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Park Joon-shik?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry if you were resting, but I have someone who wants to meet you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The doctor paled as dozens of armed gangsters entered the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Park Joon-shik gestured to one of the henchmen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah Doctor, you should rest outside for a while. I need to talk to him for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Take it easy outside. Have something like a cup of coffee from the vending machine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Two of the henchmen grabbed the doctor&#x2019;s arms and dragged him out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim! It is ready.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho entered the room with a nonchalant expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the calm just before a volcano exploded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho arrived at the bed where Park Sung-yul was lying and pulled out some papers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me ask you one thing. Is everything written here true?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul nodded with an expression like he now understood.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess Shin Chang-ho is also interested in my puzzles. If you promise not to tell the police, then I will happily let you enjoy my puzzles. How about it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Park Joon-shik cried out,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This bastard! Who are you trying to bargain with?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Joon-shik. Stay still for a while. I&#x2019;ll finish this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho looked at Park Sung-yul with cold eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course I won&#x2019;t tell the police. So answer me, everything in here is true?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul answered with a brighter expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Of course. Well, you seem to like the story. If you want more details then I will tell you... Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Park Sung-yul couldn&#x2019;t say anything else.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho grabbed Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s mouth with a big hand and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Is that so? Ah, don&#x2019;t worry. I really won&#x2019;t say anything to the police. It is natural, since I don&#x2019;t have the hobby of talking about people I kill, unlike you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof! Ooo, ooff!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s eyes shook.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The situation didn&#x2019;t make sense.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Joon-shik. Give me the scissors from earlier.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I need to dig out his eyeballs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a shame. Are you wondering why I am acting like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kkuck!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho moved his face closer to Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he whispered in the other person&#x2019;s ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This person, who you killed and proudly wrote about, was my younger sister.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho showed Park Sung-yul the page about the 13th victim.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Despair filled Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s eyes as he understood the whole situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He ended up making the family of a woman he killed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person also ended up being the leader of gangsters.</span></p><p><span style="">This nonsense...!</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul shrieked in his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt his own death.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho inserted strength in the hand holding the scissors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His sister and lover...&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, he would make the one who killed his only family pay.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Goodbye, Park Sung-yul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was a blunt shock the moment Shin Chang-ho raised his scissors into the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, this isn&#x2019;t in the contract, Cigarette Seller.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho looked at Tae-hyuk, who suddenly appeared, with cold eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The other person was holding a deformed metal pipe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard! Where did he come from?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry Hyung-nim! That bastard just suddenly moved!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They screamed as Tae-hyuk abruptly appeared in the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the iron pipe on his shoulder and spoke with a relaxed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shin Chang-ho. Cool down a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What? Don&#x2019;t tell me you want this bastard to live?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t it, but don&#x2019;t you think it is a little too much to kill him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t shrink away from the dozens of people with weapons in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he was confident that he could fight against all of them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kill him right here. Then what would happen? The bomb is excusable once the war with the prison guards is known to the press. However, it isn&#x2019;t the same when killing an inmate to resolve a grudge. This will certainly increase your sentence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Any reason I have to get out is gone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Even if she is died, don&#x2019;t you want to keep your promise to her?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the last promise that Shin Chang-ho shared with Shin Seo-yeon came to his mind.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Just wait seven years.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then a ring and flowers...</span></i></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Do you mean that she is waiting for this promise even though she is dead?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. At least, if I were her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words rippled through Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman who had waited a lifetime for him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was she still waiting even after death?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tears flowed from Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes...promise...I will keep it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul, who almost died, spoke with a relieved expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kim Cheol-su, thank you. I&apos;m alive thanks to you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed at Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, you are alive. You are alive to pay for what you have done.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the bemused Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You still have three years left in prison. Are you a regular person in here? Then let your opponent know. The price of the sins he committed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuhu, kuhuhuhu. The price of his sins? That&#x2019;s right. I know the meaning of your words now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m glad that you understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s eyes came back to life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he killed Park Sung-yul, then Shin Chang-ho would receive all of the sins.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But besides killing, there were lots of ways to torment Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho came up to Park Sung-yul and whispered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Over the next three years. I will let you know what the price of your sins are. Don&#x2019;t worry, I have a lot of skilled men. Isn&#x2019;t that right? Joon-shik.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s face filled with despair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he shifted his gaze.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Cheol-su smirked at him.</span></p><p><span style="">Ah&#x2015;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul realized who the true puppet master in this place was.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What the hell is going on?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden shouted at the armed guards and Chinese inmates standing in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of a sudden, the passage leading to the place where the prisoners were gathered had exploded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a bomb that had dealt considerable damage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know where they got it from.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the warden couldn&#x2019;t move hastily until he knew how many bombs were left.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If this continued, then the incident would leak.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Investigators would come flocking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The traces of drug smuggling that he hadn&#x2019;t disposed of would be revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...We have to take out all of the prisoners right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the doctor in charge of the infirmary came running.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Warden-nim! It is serious! Armed prisoners have attacked the infirmary...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, the infirmary?!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The infirmary was far away from the passage where the bomb exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! There are around 30 of them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god! That is almost all their power! God has helped me! If I can grab all the prisoners in the infirmary right now then this case can quietly...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The light of hope appeared in the warden&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But that didn&#x2019;t last for even 10 seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim! Did you send a request for support?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The deputy, who had been guarding the warden&#x2019;s room, came running.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What nonsense is this? Why would I do such a thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He needed to keep this incident inside the prison at all cost.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Calling external support was just committing suicide.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The counterterrorism team received Warden-nim&#x2019;s request for support and have arrived at the port by seaplane...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden ran forward with a blank expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He opened a window and looked out at the shoreline.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The deputy&#x2019;s words were true.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I never sent a request for support!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden howled.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to the support of the soldiers, the war inside the prison ended simply.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Investigators came to investigate the cause of the incident and found the drug farms.</span></p><p><span style="">The warden paid for his own sins.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a week since the end of the prison war.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the end of Blue Dragon Prison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The incident couldn&#x2019;t be blocked and spread through the Internet media at a tremendous pace.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was all Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s work.</span></p><p><span style="">The cruel acts of the guards and the war of the prisoners against it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It caused a lot of controversy and talk on the Internet forums.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the warden was arrested for growing drugs, drug smuggling, abuse of prisoners by the guards, and assisting in murder.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho and his group didn&#x2019;t suffer severe punishment because the public opinion was on their side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the fact that no one was hurt also played a role.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, all of them were just punished with a month of solitary confinement.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lay on the bed in his cell and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Two years later, Shin Chang-ho would&#x2019;ve found out that Park Sung-yul killed his sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the day after all of Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s puzzles were solved by the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Shin Chang-ho brutally killed Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">He staged it as a suicide.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The investigation didn&#x2019;t last long. Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s men had firmly closed their mouths so the case seemed to be closed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the truth of the incident was revealed due to the intervention of a genius investigator.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s seven year sentence was increased to 15 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">During the extra eight years of imprisonment, Shin Chang-ho became Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mentor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;With this, the relationship between Shin Chang-ho and Seo Tae-hyuk is gone. Now it exists only in my memories.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">Today, the closure of the Blue Dragon Prison was finally decided.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In 10 days, the prisoners here would be distributed across prisons throughout the country.</span></p><p><span style="">Quite ironically, Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s gang was sent to the same prison as Park Sung-yul.</span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese inmates would be sent back to China.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had grown drugs, so no one knew what type of ending they would have.</span></p><p><span style="">At night, Tae-hyuk rose from his bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used the last remaining sleeping pills to send Yoo Cheol-ho to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then the game will start now. Let&#x2019;s find the gold and perfectly change my destiny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining period was three days.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything had to be finished during that time.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
