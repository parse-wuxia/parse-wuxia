<p><span style="">Chapter 95 - Big Brother&#x2019;s Raid #6</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuaaaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother grabbed his head and shouted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As if a bullet had passed by his face, blood started to emerge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuheok...keeeok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A rough groan couldn&#x2019;t help emerging.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt like falling onto the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Big Brother held on with superhuman patience.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though it hurt, it wasn&#x2019;t fatal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the opponent also suffered an injury.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When comparing his weapons and his basic stamina, the odds were still overwhelmingly in his favor.</span></p><p><span style="">But how on earth did he get hurt?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother couldn&#x2019;t understand it.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the opponent wasn&#x2019;t safe either.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Blood was dripping down between the cracked mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This bastard...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Phantom was sending him a crazy smile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like this situation was satisfactory, even though he was seriously injured.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The killer was unable to kill me. But... It really hurts!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He pretended that he was fine, but he was actually covered in cold sweat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, he should&#x2019;ve been dead.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though it was reduced by half, it wouldn&#x2019;t be unusual if he was stunned.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to fulfill several conditions for Damage to Both Sides to be used.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First, he had to touch the opponent for a certain amount of time, and exchange questions and answers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The range of Damage to Both Sides was determined by the content.</span></p><p><span style="">If he was told that there was someone the opponent wanted to protect, the opponent would become linked to that person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then their wounds would be shared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the other hand, if he answered that only himself was important, then a different effect would occur.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the problem with bad guys. They talk too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If the opponent had fired the gun before Damage to Both Sides was triggered, then it would&#x2019;ve been over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to prevent such a situation, Tae-hyuk made Big Brother think that his plan was to take off the reinforced suit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That alone reduced his defensive capability, but it allowed Big Brother to move much faster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he deliberately allowed himself to be caught.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Looking at what he did with the hostages, this killer is the type to play with his opponents. It is easy to buy time if I create a suitable atmosphere.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, Damage to Both Sides was completely triggered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed a finger at his chest and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now you can&apos;t kill me. Fire one more shot if you are curious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuock, do you think I won&#x2019;t do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother aimed at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body and pulled the trigger. However, his target was the shoulder, not the heart.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The gunshot rang out and blood simultaneously appeared on both Tae-hyuk and Big Brother.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuhak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The one shooting is the one who is suffering.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How? Did it do nothing? Wasn&#x2019;t it a clear shot?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Only you are hurt, you clown.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s taunt stunned Big Brother.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He attacked the opponent only to get wounded himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, it seemed like he was the only one feeling pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time Big Brother felt fear since he was born.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Thank god for the medicine.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The two people suffered the same damage due to Damage to Both Sides.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reason why Big Brother&#x2019;s suffering was overwhelming was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">While hiding among the hostages, Tae-hyuk had injected medicine into his body to reduce the pain in advance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an anesthetic that he got from T Medical Centre.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to it, Tae-hyuk was able to bluff like he didn&#x2019;t get hurt at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It worked very well.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother was in a panicked state.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how he attacked the opponent, he would only get hurt himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know what witchcraft was used, but he couldn&#x2019;t attack.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, Tae-hyuk was the same.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally Damage to Both Sides.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he attacked Big Brother now, then the damage would return to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;But he doesn&#x2019;t know that. Then my bluff will work!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Big Brother with mocking eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was an elite killer with the best skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When had he ever received such humiliating treatment?&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, all of Big Brother&#x2019;s patience disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother glared at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Still, I&apos;m glad. I was able to protect my precious people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Precious people?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned and looked at Min Soo-young and Min Soo-yeon, who were shaking in place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he muttered in a soft tone,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I came to save these children. It is impossible to allow a killer to murder them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two sisters looked at Phantom with wide eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The whole reason Phantom was here was in order to save them?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was so surprising that they couldn&#x2019;t say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother looked between Phantom, Min Soo-young, and Min Soo-yeon. He then started laughing like crazy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know what magic Phantom was using to protect his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Still, the reason he came here was to protect those children.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuahahaha! A criminal trying to save someone is funny. Then, let&#x2019;s see if you can save them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother laughed and pointed his gun at the two sisters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He no longer hesitated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First, one foot forward.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a </span><i><span style="">tang </span></i><span style="">and blood emerged from Min Soo-young&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And another foot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Blood covered Min Soo-yeon&#x2019;s chest as she held her sister&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">The two people, who the Phantom was trying to protect, were killed at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">How about this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">His purpose...&#xA0;</span><span style="">P...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuheok... T-this... Keook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, blood spurted from Big Brother&#x2019;s head and chest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the floor approached Big Brother&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, to be exact, Big Brother&#x2019;s body was collapsing towards the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">At the last moment, Big Brother realized it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom didn&#x2019;t use strange magic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the strange thing himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And he probably created...</span></p><p><i><span style="">Flop.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Big Brother killed two people at the same time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The effects of Damage to Both Sides triggered, causing him to die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue as he looked at Big Brother&#x2019;s corpse on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You. Your skills were too good. If you didn&#x2019;t kill them both at the same time, then you would&#x2019;ve lived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom killed the killer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hostages realized this and cheered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-We&#x2019;re saved!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Waaaah!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people started crying as they realized that they had survived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One hostage went up to the fallen children.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You bad person... You killed these children...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly reached out and touched his fingers to their necks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was marginal, but there was still a pulse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They are still alive. However, it would be better to call a doctor as soon as possible. Go outside and tell the police there there are two severely wounded people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M-Me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The hostage nodded after receiving the instructions and ran out of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the two sisters who were unconscious.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t resent me too much for giving you half of the pain. This was for the best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, he felt the pain that had been suppressed by the anesthetic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A crying hostage bowed to Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Thank you for saving us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then like dominos, the other hostages also gave thanks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom-nim. Thank you very much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took a deep breath and told the hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s get out of here. The killer seems to have set up bombs. Take these children as well. They are seriously injured, so be careful not to shock them.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Leave it to us!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The spirited hostages left the room one by one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A few people remained and gently lifted the stunned children.</span></p><p><span style="">Once all of them left the room, Tae-hyuk was suddenly alone.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he couldn&#x2019;t forget about Big Brother&#x2019;s weapons.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were things that weren&#x2019;t readily available in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just taking the guns would be the reward for today&#x2019;s work.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Big Brother&#x2019;s corpse and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is literally Damage to Both Sides.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk, who was disguised as Kwon Joon-hyuk, mingled with the people in order to leave the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hostages were so relieved that they survived that they didn&#x2019;t even notice that their numbers had increased.</span></p><p><span style="">The police shouted with joy as the people came out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The hostages are coming!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe the culprit is dead!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the special units tried to enter the building.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are bombs installed in the building! Call the experts to dismantle the bombs!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Enter with care!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom is in there! Somehow catch him!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The men gulped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom killed an opponent with a huge firepower that couldn&#x2019;t be matched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now they might have to fight him.</span></p><p><span style="">The people who survived Big Brother swarmed everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-Any wounded, please come over here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Several ambulances were carrying injured people from the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sir, over here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A nurse shouted as she saw Tae-hyuk, who was bleeding from the head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As it happened, the ambulances belonged to the hospital where An Eun-young&#x2019;s father was the director.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">He had suffered a gunshot wound to his head and shoulder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had somehow hung on due to the power of the anesthetic but he was at his limit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would be able to get treated by pretending to be a hostage, but he wanted to avoid even a 1% chance of detection.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be better to ask for help from Moonlight Flower.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She would introduce him to an unlicensed doctor who worked in the back alleys.</span></p><p><span style="">The nurse held out her hand to grab his bag.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Give me the bag.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t give it to her since the bag contained guns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The weight was 80kg so he couldn&#x2019;t hand it over to others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That... The blood from your head...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m still half alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Breaking news.</span></i> <i><span style="">The terrorist incident in the middle of the city has ended with the death of the perpetrator.</span></i> <i><span style="">It i</span></i><span style="">s </span><i><span style="">believed that the terrorist was killed by the criminal Phantom, who wears the opera mask.</span></i> <i><span style="">The prosecutors have given an explanation that should be accurate.</span></i> <i><span style="">At the crime scene...</span></i></p><p><span style="">The young boss of Huaqing, Li Zheng, one of the 13 branches of the Triad, watched the broadcast on TV.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the end, Big Brother failed...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The boss&#x2019; attitude wasn&#x2019;t angry but his subordinate still flinched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was nervous about being shot as he carefully asked Li Zheng.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Should we send another killer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. If Big Brother failed then it means he is an opponent that can&#x2019;t be dealt with individually.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then how...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng quietly rose from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Triads has gained tremendous profit from South Korea. Sooner or later, the Red Mafia and Yakuza will fight for it. In such a situation, we can&#x2019;t fight Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They vowed revenge but the situation wasn&#x2019;t good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they mobilized many people to deal with Phantom then the other groups wouldn&#x2019;t miss it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then what...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If we can&#x2019;t kill him then we need to make him join our side.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will arrange a flight for South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not yet. Let&#x2019;s first watch the situation. Use all of Huaqing&#x2019;s power to watch the Phantom&#x2019;s movements. Then either the Red Mafia or Yakuza will try to catch him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The subordinate&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom would clearly become the center of the mafia war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, they would first look at the reactions of other organizations without intervening.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom was burning with hostility towards the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng planned to use the other organizations to hook him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng quietly watched the video on the monitor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Phantom will end up eating South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, Boss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom...</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted to have him.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother, the best killer in Huaqing was dead!&#xA0;</span><span style="">The news spread to all the crime syndicates in the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;According to the eyewitnesses, he fought Big Brother and won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wasn&#x2019;t he playing with Big Brother?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He shot Phantom, but the attacker was the one that got injured!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god! Is he even human?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He can change his face freely?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it true that the Red Mafia lost billions of dollars in forgeries due to Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who the hell is he?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t know! However, we have to get the Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t we hire him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Prepare a private plane! I am going to South Korea right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Criminals around the world started to notice a small country in the east of Asia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was only one thing they wanted: to find out Phantom&#x2019;s identity.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
