<p><span style="">Chapter 136 - Everybody Gather! #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ooooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In a dark container box, someone&#x2019;s rough groaning was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The blue guard&#x2019;s uniform he was wearing was drenched in sweat.</span></p><p><span style="">The person was in his late 20s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The young guard was tied to a pole with his hands behind his back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A cable tie, that police used as a handcuff substitute, was being used to keep him confined.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a string made of a very thick and durable plastic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to take it off, a wire cutter was necessary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His wrists and 10 fingers were bound together, so it was literally impossible to move a single finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuooooh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard wondered why he was in this situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He seemed to have been hit by someone in the back of the head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to get to work, he had to get to the port by car and then sail for another 30 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He parked his car in his usual space and came out...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hueok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guard shrieked as something white appeared in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first he thought it was a ghost.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But when he opened his eyes wide and checked, it was a man wearing a mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wore a black outfit in a dark room, so it looked like his head was floating.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should carefully look at the sides when getting out of the car.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof, oooof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry about this. You want to say something, but there is a gag in your mouth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The black shadow came up and pulled out the fabric blocking the guard&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he was able to do what he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;....C-Cough! P-P-Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Am I so famous that you are shouting with a happy face to see me? This is the taste of appearing on TV. Shouldn&#x2019;t I take this opportunity to get one CF?&#x201D; (CF=commercial)</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom started to talk nonsense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard looked at Phantom with an perplexed expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard thought back to eight generations of his family tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, none of them were associated with the mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Why did you attack me? Didn&#x2019;t you say that you were aiming for the mafia?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That? Did I say I would only catch the mafia?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, don&#x2019;t worry too much. I don&#x2019;t plan to do anything to you. If you help me, then you will be able to go home without being hurt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...If I refuse?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The exposed mouth gently curved upwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What will happen? I personally recommend that you don&#x2019;t listen. Do you still want to hear it?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom was holding a knife.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard shook his head and bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Name, Cho Il-jang. 29 years old. You started working at Red Phoenix three months ago. You haven&#x2019;t received a ticket yet? Due to recent worries, you haven&#x2019;t been able to sleep properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His name and age wasn&#x2019;t so hard to find out, but the last part gave him goose bumps.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t even tell his parents that he was struggling!</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t have a long time to explain so I&#x2019;ll just tell you what I want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Il-jang, a new guard, gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">Perhaps Phantom wanted inside information about Red Phoenix.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he picked the wrong person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Il-jang hadn&#x2019;t even received a proper pass yet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was literally just a rookie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know anything about the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Phantom wanted information then he should&#x2019;ve snatched another guard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it is over now. Your cries or moans won&#x2019;t register properly. Oh, did I say I would give an explanation? This is all you need to do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom swung the iron pipe that was hidden behind his body.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Peeok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Il-jang couldn&#x2019;t even scream as he fell unconscious.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just sleep here for one day. Think of it as a vacation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom pulled off the mask to reveal Cho Il-jang&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same as the face in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, he would enter Red Phoenix Prison as the new guard Cho Il-jang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he would grab the hand of the Bomber and escape.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom looked at Cho Il-jang who had fallen unconscious.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will leave evidence behind so that you can avoid being framed. Well, I&#x2019;ll also help you out with the boss who has been bothering you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police officers patrolling the area in 24 hours would find the car that was left unattended.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had until then to finish everything.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This brat must be crazy. Why are you so late?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Il-jang&#x2019;s supervisor, Kim Byung-gun, wasn&#x2019;t feeling well this morning.</span></p><p><span style="">His junior made him wait 10 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. My car broke down so I hurriedly had to take a taxi... But it seems like I am still a little late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t you answer be I&#x2019;m sorry I&#x2019;m late?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah, no.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? You&#x2019;re not even looking in the face of your sunbae when talking. Shouldn&#x2019;t this brat show respect for your sunbae?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m not ignoring you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then do you dislike looking at my face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was like a Mobius strip; it seemed like it would go on forever.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk held his tongue and looked as sorry as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Then shouldn&#x2019;t we be getting on the boat? If we don&#x2019;t hurry, then we will miss the good positions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This bastard...move.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The newbie stared fearfully at his angry expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But Kim Byung-gun didn&#x2019;t see how his mouth slowly curved upwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then pick a suitable place to sit down.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk naturally sat at the empty entrance side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I don&#x2019;t want to sit facing the sea breeze. Aish, this rookie is late, so there are no other seats.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Red Phoenix Prison was far away from land.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, abuse under the pretext of education was widespread.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, the prison warden was a colonel in the army.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every word from his mouth emphasized discipline.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the prison guards of Red Phoenix were so obedient to the ones above them that they were like soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">The ship arrived at the prison, and the guards started to disembark.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Byung-gun said with a sneer,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t you do the heavy lifting for your sunbae? Look at you. Have you only come here once or twice?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m take it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes brat. Move a little bit faster.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is enough to cause a neurosis. Isn&#x2019;t it like a military pairing? No, isn&#x2019;t it worse? At least there is a time limit until I can be discharged from the army.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The turnover rate here was higher than everywhere else.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A guard who had his cap covering his face was at the prison entrance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was holding a metal detector in his hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even the guards had to be thoroughly searched.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Kim Byung-gun, who were at the exit, were the first to get off the ship.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, they were at the front of the line to enter the prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please stand in one line.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The method for a physical search was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First, all metallic objects would be placed in a basket, and then the body would be checked with the detector.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Biiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The detector made a loud sound as it moved around Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person checking him was perplexed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, what is this? Hey, Newbie. What did you miss?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&apos;m really sorry.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t just apologize. Ah, the people waiting behind...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, maybe my leather belt...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you not to wear a metal one! Ah, I feel like I am being tortured due to this brat. Ack! Why are you taking off your pants here? Just enter. Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes! Sunbae, good work!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Tae-hyuk passed, it was Kim Byung-gun&#x2019;s turn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His face was completely rotten.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As soon as he passed through the checkpoint, he spat at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, this fucking brat. What a stupid thing to do. How many times have I told you to be careful?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun spat on the floor and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Head for the accommodations and wait there. I will show you hell today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he walked towards the smoking area.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled widely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2014;As planned.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk touched his belly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could feel something bulging out.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two reasons why Tae-hyuk chose Cho Il-jang as the target of Disguise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a famous target among the prison guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if Tae-hyuk behaved strangely, the guards would just blame it on him being a brat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It was the right thing to sit at the entrance.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The entrance of the ship was an area that people avoided because it was very busy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, today there would be a sea breeze and water splashing if anyone sat there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a place that the prison guards were reluctant to sit.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he was able to get off first when arriving at the destination.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That&#x2019;s why he deliberately arrived just as the ship was going to depart.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Tae-hyuk was able to pass the physical examination very quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The person in charge of the checkpoint today dislikes Cho Il-jang. It will be impossible for him to ignore the long line and do a slow physical search.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he could safely pass through the checkpoint while hiding various things in his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And another reason why...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! Cho Il-jang! What are you doing! Quickly change clothes to prepare for your shift!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One of the guards urged him quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the building that the guards were entering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber was trapped inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This guy is in charge of the bombs.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">He was changing clothes in the dressing room when he heard a rough voice from somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This bastard. Why did I say just now? Didn&#x2019;t I say to head to the accommodations?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. I was told it was my shift right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun&#x2019;s temper ignited as he heard the name from Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck, that bastard must be crazy. Who is the most senior one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kim Byung-gun sunbae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you should listen to me until the end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will listen to Kim Byung-gun sunbae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you know this? Hey, you brat. Come with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun grabbed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s collar and pulled him into a warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guard at the entrance of the warehouse saw Kim Byung-gun&#x2019;s face and pretended not to know anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After entering the warehouse, Kim Byung-gun hurled Tae-hyuk to the floor and shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Today you are dead. Eh? Is this bastard smiling?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuhuhuhut...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Very well...a-aaack! W-What is that?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took out a scalpel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was something that he had hidden in his clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was only a blade without a holder, so he had to hold it with the tips of his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Scalpel No.20. It is good for making large incisions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This crazy bastard, crazy! You brought a razor blade? F-Fuck...it was good that I brought this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun said angrily as he pulled out a taser.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he turned on the output to the maximum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough to take down a martial artist.</span></p><p><span style="">Despite seeing the taser gun, the bastard still stood with a confident face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Today is your memorial service day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Kim Byung-gun while holding the scalpel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun got goosebumps.</span></p><p><span style="">Since when did that person smile laugh like that?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a laugh that seemed to suit the criminals locked up here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am looking forward to your replacement.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
