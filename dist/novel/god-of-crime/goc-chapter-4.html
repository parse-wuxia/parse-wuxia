<p><strong>Chapter 4 I Don&#x2019;t Think it is a Dream #4.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Chapter 4 - I Don&#x2019;t Think it is a Dream #4</span></p><hr><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;It seems that I can&#x2019;t learn skills just from touching another person&#x2019;s body.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk had deliberately touched Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s hand as he was giving him the money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was no reaction from the mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Then what is it?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Surely it wasn&#x2019;t just the Robbery skill?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was just too much that he didn&#x2019;t know.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Let&#x2019;s just think about Yoo Cheol-ho first.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was impossible for him to catch the killer directly. He didn&#x2019;t even know the success rate of Robbery, so it was suicidal to act while believing in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then there was only one thing left.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The prosecutors assured that they would be able to catch Yoo Cheol-ho tomorrow; however, according to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s dream, Yoo Cheol-ho would start fleeing across the country for more than a month.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Within that time period, three innocent civilians would be killed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The most important thing was for Tae-hyun to deviate from the predetermined date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If Yoo Cheol-ho were caught today... then the three victims that were supposed to die would be saved in the end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He hoped that he could change the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk hurried into action.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Yes. I will call a reliable detective.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk thought about who to contact while searching through his pockets.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He then pulled out his handphone to make a call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;... There is no more battery.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an old-fashioned flip phone that he inherited from his sister. Even if he charged it every day, it was still a junk phone that would quickly run out of power.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk went to a nearby convenience store and charged his handphone. A few minutes would be enough to make one call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The TV in the store was showing news about Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-Finally, there is a reward of 50 million won. However, his location is still unknown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Bounty!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk almost fell backwards at that word.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Why didn&apos;t I think of it before? He is an escaped prisoner, so naturally there will be a reward!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Come to think of it, his brother had said something similar this morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At first, this was simply to check if he was in a dream or not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then he suddenly learned a strange crime skill - but this fact wasn&#x2019;t too important.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;50 million won...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was an amount that allowed him to not only buy clothes for his hard-working sister, but also allowed them to get out of the monthly rented semi-basement room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The person he called would be someone who would obtain a huge merit. Therefore, he wanted to give it to someone he knew.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Yes. I will call Cho Kang-suk hyung.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was a crime squad investigator who had questioned Tae-hyuk several times in the past. He was one of the few people who treated Tae-hyuk as a human instead of a death row inmate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">His promotion luck was quite bad, despite have a vibrant sense of justice, so he was still in the field despite being in his late 40s.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;He should be roughly in his 30s right now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After confirming that the battery was charged to a certain extent, Tae-hyuk pressed a number.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-This is the Gang-dong police station.</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I wish to speak to Detective Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-Yes, I understand.</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a moment of silence before Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s voice was heard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-Yes, the phone has been changed. I am Cho Kang-suk of the Gang-dong police station&#x2019;s 2nd team.</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Will I really get a reward if I catch Yoo Cheol-ho?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk asked directly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-It has to be directly. Or can it just be a crucial tip that leads to the arrest... Hey, are you a high school student? Why are you making a prank call? If I catch you then I&#x2019;ll be angry!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a reaction that Tae-hyuk had expected from Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was more like a neighbourhood hyung than a detective.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is real. But is it in cash? What are the tax percentages?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-Hyung is busy so I&#x2019;m hanging up.</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;It is definitely Yoo Cheol-ho. Isn&#x2019;t this a situation where you have to find every grain of rice&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">that Yoo Cheol-ho&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">shed while eating? How about just checking it out?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-I will do it. I hope it is real or I will one punch you so hard that three teeth will be knocked out.</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-How did you even see him?</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I made a delivery.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>-Even an escaped prisoner has to eat.</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk smiled widely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Despite his crude way of speaking, Cho Kang-suk was a thorough detective. He would check any minor clue directly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk told Kang-suk his location.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">* &#xA0; &#xA0; * &#xA0; &#xA0; *</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Fuck. It is real. To think that he was hiding in this type of place. Son of a bitch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He used the walkie-talkie, requesting that reinforcements be sent from the investigation headquarters.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I found where he is hiding. Location...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk patted Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Sorry for doubting you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;No problem. Please be sure to catch him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Then. Watch as I catch him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk licked the ice cream Kang-suk bought him and watched the arrest operation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The rest happened quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The investigation had been in trouble because there were no witnesses to report the location. But now they knew exactly where he was hiding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Cho Kang-suk acted quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After contacting the special investigation headquarters, dozens of police cars arrived.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk watched in interest as they broke through the door of the building.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yoo Cheol-ho took off the clothes that he was wearing and started to run away quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Cho Kang-suk threw himself onto Yoo Cheol-ho, like a hawk hunting its prey.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yoo Cheol-ho was handcuffed and started screaming. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Fuck! Which son of a bitch knew I was here? Tell me! I&#x2019;ll bite off the flesh on their bones!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yoo Cheol-ho was taken away by five police officers while still furiously struggling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk just watched as he put the last bit of ice cream in his mouth..</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ah, cool!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was sweet and delicious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After Yoo Cheol-ho was dragged out, the police entered the church to find any remaining evidence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Cho Kang-suk continued walking around with a walkie-talkie to check if there were any more threats to Tae-hyuk, the witness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk thought it was good that the tip went to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Ah, Detective-nim. You are rejuvenated. You don&#x2019;t even have the potbelly anymore.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was so different from the Cho Kang-suk he remembered that Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t help laughing. Only the eyes that burned with the flames of justice were the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Detective Cho Kang-suk. You should now receive a special promotion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Brat. If&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">you are facing</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;any trouble, contact Hyung... but you don&#x2019;t look like the type who will be easily bullied. &quot;Ah. Have you eaten lunch? Shall Hyung buy you a bowl of jajangmyeon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wah. I gave you the top merit for catching this criminal, yet you only want to buy&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">m</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">e a bowl of jajangmyeon?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Well. Do you want tangsuyuk as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Nope. I&#x2019;ve actually already eaten. Instead, there is something else I need your hel</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">p with</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. Help me get the bounty money</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, as</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">his is my first time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Cho Kang-suk chuckled. He seemed to like the bold Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Haha. Doesn&#x2019;t it sound like you&#x2019;re planning to do this again?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Puhaha. What is with that expression? Anyway. You are Tae-hyuk? Really, thank you. Yoo Cheol-ho, that bastard, is a really dangerous guy.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Had he</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">escaped,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;then he would have definitely</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;started</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;kill</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ing</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;again. We were able to catch him without any&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">injury,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;thanks to your report.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk felt something hot rising from within his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He hadn&#x2019;t realized because he had been focused on the reward.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk had saved the lives of three future murder victims.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The tragedy in the future had changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The &#xA0;mirror vibrated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Eh, I didn&#x2019;t bump into anyone.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The crime skill Robbery seemed to activate regardless of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s will.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, there was the condition that he needed to touch the other person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He pulled out the mirror and checked the sentences.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><span><a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[You can use the affinity points to enhance crime skills or activate hidden attributes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D;</span></p><hr><p></p></div><div class="footnotes"><ol><li><span id="footnote-3">affinity points have been acquired.<a href="#footnoteref-3" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li></ol></div><p></p>
