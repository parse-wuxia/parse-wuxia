<p>Chapter 76 - Doll Play #2</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk finished drawing the picture and quickly left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although the opera mask covered his face, it was still risky if he encountered Kang-suk here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe I should find another disguise.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had obtained this from one of the guests from the the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The texture of the plaster mask wasn&#x2019;t bad.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&#x2019;s better than wearing a stocking over my head. Doesn&#x2019;t it liven up the atmosphere? It&#x2019;s more fun than playing with dolls.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the image that he drew when he looked at the Christmas tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a clue obtained by using one of his precious bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course it was valuable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then I will start earnestly going after Doll Play from tomorrow. First of all, let&#x2019;s handle the witness.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed the iron pipe, turned, and headed toward the building where the witness was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he got to the roof, he saw two people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid behind a wall and listened to their conversation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought the bomb was a dud so I ran over right away. Yes, what do you have?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, that... That. Someone who looked like a criminal was walking around so I made sure to get him on my camera...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohhhh! Kwon Joon-hyuk! That is a big jackpot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the man who praised the AD, Kwon Joon-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t need to use the Spying skill to determine his name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew who he was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Whoa. I didn&#x2019;t think I would meet Shin Se-ho again here.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a bit unpleasant to call it a relationship, but Tae-hyuk knew Shin Se-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a man who visited Tae-hyuk every day in jail, asking questions that invaded his privacy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was annoyed and eventually refused his visits every time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was an enemy who waited for Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s visits and questioned her against her will.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, he was a man who would sell his soul for a scoop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait a minute.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk remembered something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">In his past life, the media revealed that Ha-ran was his sister and turned her life into a mess.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He remembered that Shin Se-ho was passing by when Seo Ha-ran left the visitation room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shot Shin Se-ho a cold look.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;&#x2026;For the sake of a scoop, he would even do a crime. I should take full advantage of this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho reached out to Kwon Joon-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me see the video that you took.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That...that...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it? Why do you look so scared? What type of Islam terrorist group did you capture in the shot?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho spoke with an excited face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A video of the crime scene and a bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could imagine how valuable it was.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kwon Joon-hyuk explained what he saw.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho became upset and angry after hearing it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you crazy? You were looking at the person through a telephoto lens. This is 200 meters away. How could he see your face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-Really. The opera mask guy obviously saw me and smirked!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho clicked his tongue and shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You definitely took the video right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Please confirm it, PD-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Let&#x2019;s see what type of bastard we have here. Opera mask? Are you the Phantom or something? Puhaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaagh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho frowned at Kwon Joon-hyuk&#x2019;s sudden scream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I almost fell because you scared me. Why are you making such a fuss? Did a crazy ghost appear or something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That... P-PD-nim! B-Behind...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is behind... Arrrgh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho looked back and fell down from surprise.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A man in an opera mask was walking towards them with an iron pipe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk tsk tsk. You should have believed in your subordinate. At least you could&#x2019;ve run away then.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Someone who likes stealing, voice phishing, art forgery, gambling, and violence. Ah, I also just did a bomb attack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">The unidentified man suddenly laid a stone on the floor and smashed it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll have to test whether your heads are harder than this stone when hit by an iron pipe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a threat that was several times more realistic than being threatened with a gun or a knife.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-Are you going to kill us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The opera masked man, Seo Tae-hyuk, slowly approached Shin Se-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Horror filled Shin Se-ho and Kwon Joon-hyuk&#x2019;s face as they backed away, their eyes the iron pipe the whole time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Suddenly, they reached a place where they couldn&#x2019;t retreat anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be careful. It would be funny if you fell.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;ABS Station PD, Shin Se-ho. I wanted to meet you at least once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How do you know my name....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First of all, rest assured that I won&#x2019;t hurt you. I just want a deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Deal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. First, erase the data from that camera. And if you do me a few favors, I will give you a huge scoop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person in front of him seemed like a monster that had come out from a movie, yet he was making an offer like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I only want to talk to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He meant to get rid of the AD.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand. Kwon Joon-hyuk. Go to the corner and cover your ears.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, yep!&#x201D; On the other side of the roof?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Kwon Joon-hyuk disappeared, Tae-hyuk explained his proposal with a satisfied look.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s fingers started to tremble.&#xA0;</span><span style="">According to the opera masked man, it was an extraordinary scoop that would overturn the Korean media.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-Is that really true? Ah, no... What is it really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is up to you to accept my proposal or not, but I think you would be a fool if you refused.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho had a quick and accurate judgement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He ran to the AD in the corner, took out the memory from the camera, and handed it to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. Then I will contact you soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Please wait a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho pulled his business card from his wallet.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Call me at this number. A-And... Do you really want me to broadcast about the Bathroom Killer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the alias that the media had used for the Hippo case.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Think of it as a down payment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oh my god... If it is known that the killer was a police officer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I will send you the evidence. Well, can I send it to the address on this card?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, yep!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho realized that the man in front of him was a treasure trove that couldn&#x2019;t be missed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, if you break the rules that I set, then it will be detrimental to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. However, Phantom... Haha, I thought of that name since you are wearing an opera mask. I mean, can I call you Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and nodded his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t bad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just call me that comfortably.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then please go in peace!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho bowed.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the deal with the ABS Station PD, Shin Se-ho, was over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Pretty soon, the public would know of the existence of Phantom, the God of Crime.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There were dark circles under Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes as he returned to the orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk paused from where he was playing with the children and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, Kang-suk hyung. Did you just finish work now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It is due to some completely crazy bastard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... You must&#x2019;ve had a hard time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk, who knew exactly what Kang-suk had gone through, laughed lowly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After the deal with Shin Se-ho, Tae-hyuk had made a brilliant explosion as promised.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t the special bomb made by Kim Tae-sung, but one that could be bought for 3,000 won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a fireworks display set.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Still, the police were able to recover one of the remaining four bombs so they didn&#x2019;t just suffer.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The suffering of the police didn&#x2019;t end there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the new year, those who tried to cover up the Hippo incident would be stripped of their clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s position, as the one who arrested the Hippo, would become even stronger.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything was going according to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Then I have to finish up with Doll Play.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought about it as he threw the dice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, another 12? Is this person cheating right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Stop moving! Under him! Check if he has padded pants...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed the head of a screaming little boy.</span></p><p><span style="">In no time, there were tens of millions of won piled up in front of Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was fake money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the game board, Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hotels and buildings were piled up like a mountain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Gambling skill impacting things like throwing the dice, so he landed on the Seoul, New York, and London group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t easy to try and lose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aah! I don&apos;t want to!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t easy to play with kids.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Tae-hyuk. Don&#x2019;t you have an aptitude for this? How about going down this path?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. A police officer is recommending illegal gambling.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey. I&#x2019;m talking about management, management.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Management? I was thinking of something similar.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. You will be a 3rd year next year, so it is time to think about the future. That reminds me, where is Ha-ran?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She is sleeping with the kids.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran was lying in bed with Song Hye-mi, who had returned in shock.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah... In the end, our date ended like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to the new case, he would become busier from tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style="">Before that, there was something left to do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk put the heavy styrofoam box that he was holding down on the ground and opened it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shall we have barbecue in the evening?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The children who heard it cheered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Inside the box was 20kg of pork meat.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">After a long Christmas, it was December 26th.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was still a week left of winter vacation, but Tae-hyuk had something to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, let&#x2019;s contact those kids first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk contacted Kang Han-seong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two days ago, Kang Han-seong had agreed to the proposal to work for two million won.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It is Boss!</span></i> <i><span style="">Do you have a job for me?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. How many children can you move today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Around seven to eight people.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um... It is a little lacking. If I double the money, can you gather around 20 people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hut, double...</span></i> <i><span style="">I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I will gather them there?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk agreed and hung up.</span></p><p><span style="">This was enough.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could pay four million won to 20 people.</span><span style="">Nuclear Bomb was a long term investment.</span></p><p><span style="">After an hour, they gathered at the construction site where Tae-hyuk first encountered them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim, who is that person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For some of the members, it was the first time they saw Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang Han-seong glared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That person... Money... No, employer. Then I will talk to my employer for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Han-seong scented money and approached Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Boss! What is to be done?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, Tae-hyuk pulled out five million won from his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu... So much...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;One million won is the budget for this. Distribute it properly and carry out the mission.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Han-seong licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will explain what Nuclear Bomb has to do. You will go to all the orphanages in Seoul and check if there are any missing people recently.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Can&#x2019;t you call and ask?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a reasonable question, but this was information that couldn&#x2019;t be obtained unless someone went in person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course I can. But let&apos;s think simply. Your wife left the house, and now someone called asking if your wife has left the house. What would most people reply?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;M-My wife didn&#x2019;t leave the house!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Exactly. This is just an example. Think about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough... Boss is definitely correct. I would also be ashamed and not tell the truth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That was also why it was hard to solve domestic violence cases.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to judge on the phone, so the caseworker would have to visit every day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By acting like a harmonious family, the person could easily get rid of the charges.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are roughly 40 orphanages in Seoul, so one person will be in charge of two places. Please note that you not only have to meet with the person in charge, but also talk to the children living there...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk then recalled the appearance of the thugs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They looked suspicious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;At any check, do as much as you can to check if there are any children who disappeared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong bowed politely.</span></p><p><span style="">It would take two to three hours to finish this. but each person could earn 100,000 won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was 30,000 won per hour.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, half of the share was distributed to the leader Kang Han-seong.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu... Two million won for a day of work. Boss, I will swear my allegiance forever.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang Han-seong got up from his seat and delivered Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s instructions to his subordinates.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he sat on a chair and looked at the members of Nuclear Bomb.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
