<p><span style="">Chapter 74 - Huge Reward #3 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;My dad was like human garbage. My mother got out of the house early, and by the time I grew up, I had bruises all over my body. I couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore. When I recovered my spirit, I was in the middle of nowhere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her voice was calm, as if she was telling someone else&#x2019;s story.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hye-mi arrived at the Emergency Relief Centre a year ago, where other children with similar situations were gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The treatment I received there wasn&#x2019;t that good. Well, that&#x2019;s the mindset of the Korean people. It is the role of a parent to punish their child. I was seen as a troublemaker who ran away because I didn&#x2019;t like my home. Up to now, my explanation seemed like a rough morning drama.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They absolutely weren&#x2019;t pleasant memories.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Still, Hye-mi continued to speak with a serene expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like her sorrow had already become weathered down in the passage of time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is strange isn&#x2019;t it? That place seemed to have gathered all the misery in the world in the same place. When I was there, happiness felt like an illusion that I couldn&#x2019;t have. And then I met Unni. Despite what she suffered, Unni was always the one taking care of the crying or depressed children.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk visualized An Eun-young and nodded,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are people like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi&#x2019;s frozen expression slightly softened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it&#x2019;s easy to talk to you. Normally I only get one of two reactions when I tell my story, but you don&#x2019;t have either of them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk seemed to know whether what she was saying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She either received sympathy or contempt, feelings that made a person feel miserable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At any rate, I will continue the story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi&#x2019;s story continued.</span></p><p><span style="">The two people suddenly became friends as Soo-bin looked after Hye-mi like an older sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hye-mi always followed along behind her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only uneasy thing was that they didn&#x2019;t know when they would be separated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Emergency Relief Centre was just a temporary residence for people affected by domestic violence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The children there would either return home or go to a facility.</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi and Soo-bin would be separated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a small miracle happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people were sent to the same orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a one in a hundred chance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once it was decided, they were so delighted that they hugged each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Many things happened after we came to the orphanage. Sometimes, my drunk dad came and asked for his daughter to be returned. There was a thief in middle school, so I received a nighttime punishment. However, Unni was able to help me successfully overcome everything and anything that came my way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi and Soo-bin were family to each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They fought against the discrimination of the world with their slender bodies.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But there was one mistake. It wouldn&#x2019;t end with living at the same orphanage. For Unni, she only had two years left to live here, so we made a promise. As soon as possible, we would make a lot of money so that we could live together. This is the token.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi pushed out her left hand.</span></p><p><span style="">There was something like a copper ring on his little finger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was bumpy, like it wasn&#x2019;t properly made.</span></p><p><span style="">Contrary to appearances, Tae-hyuk was well versed in art and quickly noticed what it was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, is that a bearing?&#x201D; (Refering to the ball bearing that reduces friction between moving parts)</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Unni got it. She didn&#x2019;t want to be in school and got a job as soon as possible. That is where Unni first made this. There was no money to buy a ring.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Putting a ring on their little fingers meant fulfilling their wish.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Soo-bin was obviously filled with the desire to live with Hye-mi away from the orphanage as quickly as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was another meaning to the ring, however.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Either way, do you understand now? This is a token of my promise with Unni. I will continue wearing this on my finger as I promised. Unni didn&#x2019;t run away. I&#x2019;m sure she was scouted into a company and got a good job. Once she makes a lot of money, she will come back for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi looked at the ring on her left little finger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">To her, this ring given by Soo-bin was more precious than a gold ring that was worth a hundred, no a thousand times more.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing Hye-mi&#x2019;s story, his doubts changed into conviction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Soo-bin didn&#x2019;t run away, and was involved in this case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The problem was that it wasn&#x2019;t exactly clear how.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started organizing things.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Right now, three different cases are happening at the same time.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">First, the disappearance of the famous actress Ryu Myung-hwa.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then girls started disappearing like they were following her example.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The final case was the mutilation murder that Kang-suk went to investigate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How were they related to each other?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Indeed, this case is too complicated. In the end, the killer didn&#x2019;t get caught.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It also meant that he only knew about what happened in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had no information about the culprit behind this case.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Truly. Isn&#x2019;t it all the same? So far, I have been fouling.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had to dig into the truth of the incidents with just his crime skills and Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s own abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, the reward was huge, compared to what he had seen so far.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Either way, Tae-hyuk squeezed out as much knowledge of the future as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he remembered one useful thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wasn&#x2019;t Gangdong Police Station the headquarters of this doll case? And the coroner is...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he wanted to identify the body that was found this time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And maybe...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put on as good of an expression as possible and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hye-mi. Do you want to go to a place where Soo-bin might be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What are you talking about?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure. No one knows if Soo-bin is there or not. So I wanted to check. Perhaps in this world, you are the one who knows the most about Soo-bin.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi looked at him with a bemused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You want me to help you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I guess so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Most of the adults treated Hye-mi as a poor child, yet he asked for her help?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time she had received such an offer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hye-mi didn&#x2019;t dislike it so she nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I can help since you asked me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a need to pay for the transaction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to buy a meal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll treat you to a delicious meal. How about burgers?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Beef rib eye.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a cheap citizen who ate spicy pork stir-fry on a date with Moonlight Flower, but beef?&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, solving this case required Hye-mi&#x2019;s cooperation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt regret, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Okay. The negotiations are concluded.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi used what she had surprisingly well.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk added one last thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right. Maybe I&#x2019;ll do something a bit bad. Keep it a secret from the adults.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled with a downright villainous face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are a bad person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk, who received another call from Coroner Park Min-soo, didn&#x2019;t say anything for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His fingertips were slightly shaking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It ended up spreading to his whole body.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s condition wasn&#x2019;t normal, like a person suffering from a high fever.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho asked as he drank warm coffee next to Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae. Didn&#x2019;t you just receive a call from Coroner Park? What new information did you get? Have their identities been revealed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I&#x2019;m sorry but I&#x2019;m not in the mood for jokes. Can we just sit for a while?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho whistled and pulled out a notebook to write down what he had learned about the incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The file name was untitled since the nickname of the criminal hadn&#x2019;t come out yet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, almost 20 minutes passed and he managed to clear up his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk slowly opened his dried lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They are alive.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? The victims?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. He said they were alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...What does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Looking at the state of the body, the coroner can see how long they have been dead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Indeed. That is the coroner&#x2019;s job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But this incident...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Please say it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This case. Cutting off the arms and legs... He told me that the victim was alive when they were mutilated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All expression disappeared from Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m going to cut apart this bastard alive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk howled like a wounded beast.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The arms and legs of the doll were cut off.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man looked at his work with satisfaction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was almost like an artwork, but something was lacking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Hey. Please don&apos;t look at me with those eyes. Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll give you even more beautiful things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The doll was looking at the man with a mixture of contempt and fear.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man couldn&#x2019;t stand it and pulled the doll&#x2019;s eyes out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The arms, legs and eyes should come out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was thinking about the very pretty eyes of a doll that he passed by chance a while ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he wanted, then he could get it.</span></p><p><span style="">The man hummed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll give her arms to hold me tightly, legs to run towards me, and... eyes so that she can only look at me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man&#x2019;s insanity overflowed in the dark room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how much time was remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if he hurried then he would be able to finish all the work before it was too late.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man went looking for parts to give the doll.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had Kang-suk&#x2019;s phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a copy, but he could still get a glimpse of the call history and email.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used it to clearly understand the people around Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">There were many things that could be done with it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, let&#x2019;s try it for the first time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can directly imitate the voice of Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk called Coroner Park Min-soo with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, Min-soo. Are you doing well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He heard a tired voice over the phone.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I told you my lead.</span></i> <i><span style="">10 minutes ago, I called and reported the situation.</span></i> <i><span style="">It is obvious that the victims were still alive when the mutilation occurred.</span></i> <i><span style="">Have you already forgotten?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, sorry. Actually, I called because I have a favor to ask.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What is it?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have an important witness in this case, so I want to show them the bodies. I&apos;ll send them&#xA0;to your location. Please.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Hey, that&apos;s illegal.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is why I am asking you. It will just be between us.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hrmm...</span></i></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo hesitated a little before replying.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Will this help you solve this case?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">I am here alone now so I will secretly let them in.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. Oh right, you know this is confidential?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">I won&#x2019;t write it down and will take it to my grave.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&apos;ll pretend I don&#x2019;t know about this. You will do the same. At any rate, thank you. Then work hard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The call ended.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Min-soo seemed surprised that Cho Kang-suk had made such a request.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then a disguise... No, there is no need.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was still wearing the Rudolph costume from the Christmas party.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I can say that I came from a part-time job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had an accurate grasp of Park Min-soo&#x2019;s character.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t care about trivial things, and once he concentrated, he only looked at the corpse.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think there are only strange people around Hyung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took a taxi and headed to the Gangdong Morgue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was with Hye-mi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hye-mi got off the car and looked around with a perplexed face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere was unusual.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Where is this? It isn&#x2019;t a hospital...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched the back of his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hye-mi. Don&#x2019;t you want to find Soo-bin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. I have to. Unni didn&#x2019;t come to pick me up so I have to go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;m sure that Soo-bin is here. Is it okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although Hye-mi was familiar with violence, it was different from death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That&#x2019;s why she didn&#x2019;t know that the scent of death was blowing here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How do you know that Unni is here? Have you been kidnapped?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it is similar?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They moved to the side door of the morgue, where someone was standing in front of a chained door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was Park Min-soo, whom he had contacted in advance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed a few times and walked over,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Detective Cho Kang-suk sent me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Aigoo. She is a kid. Is this okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo looked at Hye-mi with anxious eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t notice the Rudolph costume that Tae-hyuk was wearing at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a child. I am big.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I see. I understand. At any rate, I&#x2019;m secretly letting you in. Please come quietly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Hye-mi went inside with Park Min-soo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place where the bodies were kept was floor 1B.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll be on lookout so the both of you go in. I&#x2019;ve put them all out so make sure you check it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was in order to keep the bodies from rotting.</span></p><p><span style="">Once they entered, the storage was so cold that it was like a refrigerated warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was an autopsy table covered in plastic in the middle of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It looked like doll arms and legs were arranged on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Doll...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi&#x2019;s eyes trembled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fluorescent lights blinked as if they had reached the end of their life.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unfortunately, they aren&#x2019;t from dolls. Do you want to take a closer look?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi nodded silently and moved closer and she realized what was lying there.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-Body...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shh. Someone outside will hear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put on some surgical gloves that was next to the table and handed a pair to Hye-mi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She said nothing and followed Tae-hyuk in putting on the gloves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now, if she confirmed that none of the arms or legs were familiar then the long day would end.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, Hye-mi suddenly sat down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hye-mi had kept calm after her initial confusion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then did she find something notable?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He followed Hye-mi&#x2019;s gaze.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a hand with a small cut on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hand wasn&#x2019;t that pretty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were dirty with oil, and the nails were cut short.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only unusual thing was that it had an ugly, ring like object on the little finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-She was supposed to pick me up. It was a promise. The little finger...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi desperately rose from her spot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She walked towards the table like she wanted to make sure that what she saw was right.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her legs trembled so badly that it was like she would collapse at any moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite that, she walked forward slowly, step by step.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, a familiar hand was in front of Hye-mi&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After touching it a few times to confirm it, Hye-mi hugged it and fell on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She started to cry as she brought the hand to her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uwah, uwaaaaah...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The impact caused the ring on the little finger of the arm to fall to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It rolled away without anyone noticing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was almost like it was speaking,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry I couldn&#x2019;t keep my promise.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked up at the ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="">He lost his appetite.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hye-mi was stunned and tired.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk carried her out and left the morgue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He bowed towards Park Min-soo who was smoking a cigarette outside.</span></p><p><span style="">That arm was clearly Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s, but it was only one arm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He compared it with the other parts, there was no other arm covered in oil like Soo-bin&#x2019;s left arm.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo clearly said that the victim was still alive when the arm was cut off.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a chance that she was still alive.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled what he knew of the Doll Play case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the identities of the mutilated bodies weren&#x2019;t revealed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now he figured it out.</span></p><p><span style="">The future had changed with the intervention of the God of Crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is only one, but I know who the owner of the arm is. If so, I can do this investigation.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The only thing left was to catch the criminal and uncover the truth of this incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked through the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">He could hear Hye-mi breathing on his back.</span></p><p><span style="">Alive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously alive.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I will go to rescue her and Kim Soo-bin won&#x2019;t be dead.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">For Hye-mi, who desperately wanted to be happy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the sake of the huge reward, Tae-hyuk decided to start a full-blown investigation.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
