<p><span style="">Chapter 161 - God of Crime #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">He already checked that the Shooting Spree skill could be used with taser guns.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The problem is the output.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Once he fired a few shots, all of the stored electricity would be exhausted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There would surely be a lot of clowns waiting in the Clown&#x2019;s headquarters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to fight them, he had to solve the problem of his power shortage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes, connect it to Machina&#x2019;s drive...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk carried a big climbing bag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t visible, but steel parts were stored inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It contained the mechanical arm Machina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could connect it directly to a power supply and treat it like his own arm.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be better if he could replace his own arm, but he decided to be satisfied with his much.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The risk of using Body Modification was too great.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Let&#x2019;s test it out.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk focused and moved Machina.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kkikikikik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The machine arm protruded from the backpack and smashed the bricks placed in front of it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tremendous havoc!&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was just a prototype, but he could still use it as a weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Science and technology has developed much more than the public thinks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">These advanced technologies were being studied by many laboratories in the country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was what the Clown was aiming for.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pierrots were running around and getting people&#x2019;s attention.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown was preparing to rob the research institutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk planned to rescue Ha-ran while the Clown was distracted by that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;After that, I can sell the name of Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The time limit to move Machina was 120 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, shooting the taser guns would consume energy as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After entering the institute, he had to move as quickly as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He checked the time and saw that it was currently 8 p.m.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to infiltrate a place, it needed to be dark so that the opponent&#x2019;s visibility was restricted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I still have bombs and ammunition for a frontal breakthrough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a chance he would become caught by the Demon Revealing Mirror again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, Seo Ha-ran was a hostage so he needed to make sure she wasn&#x2019;t in danger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place where the Clown was based was a secluded area of the research institute.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had been here once with Ha-ran so it wasn&#x2019;t hard to find the way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, he heard voices as a group of men and women walked out of a building at Wolsang University.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you sure you asked for proxy attendance?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course! Anyway, the professors of this faculty doesn&#x2019;t even take attendance properly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... The other day, a man was imitating a woman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fufufufufu! Isn&#x2019;t that amazing? That is a bit much...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They seemed like people attending night classes at the university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They mistook Tae-hyuk for someone attending the same university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They waved and greeted him as they walked by.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Are you going to class? I think it&#x2019;s already started, so you should run.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The group laughed and disappeared into the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged and turned to go down a path.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then there was the familiar sound of a notification.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ttiring.</span></i></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Proxy Attendance has been learned.] </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...W-What? I can freely skip school if I have this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed useless.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, he was already doing well without the help of the crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After becoming a King, it seemed he could learn the skill just by witnessing a crime scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When I think about it, having someone attend class for you is a crime as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It felt cute since he had only learned bloody things for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">Not long ago, he would&#x2019;ve used Transformation and have the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror in the air.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But that play was over now.</span></p><p><span style="">He firmly made up his mind and headed towards the Clown as naturally as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As he got closer, the number of people around started to decrease.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then they completely disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he had been thrown into a completely different world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I should probably use Spying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to, but he had to use the crime skill to figure out the best route of infiltration.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, it was a race against time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran would be in danger if he didn&#x2019;t break through the enemy as quickly as possible.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Grunt.</span></i></p><p><span style="">He climbed up a tree and arrived at a window on the second floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He placed tape on the glass and smashed it with his elbow.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwajik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was the sound of something breaking and Tae-hyuk carefully crawled into the building.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kuweeeoooh!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The wails of the mad could be heard from somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuk, kuruk, kueeok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pierrots patrolled the dark corridors.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like a zombie in a zombie movie.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved as carefully as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;How badly did they get addicted to the Psychotropic Incense that they are acting like this?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t humans anymore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their disgusting appearance was enough to cause nausea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, it seemed like they would be able to return to normal if they received proper treatment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uw...uweeeok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid behind a wall and looked at the movements of the clowns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their movements had three things in common.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First of all, their sense of smell and hearing is very sensitive. They even react to the sound of the wind. In comparison, their eyesight is relatively bad. Aren&#x2019;t they completely like zombies...?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were different from the ones in the movies.</span></p><p><span style="">They moved according to the orders of the person who gave them the Psychotropic Incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He checked the map created by Spying and saw a route leading underground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the Demon Revealing Mirror started to vibrate.</span></p><p><span style="">[Kill the security guards and defeat the &#x2018;Clown&#x2019;!]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spat on the floor as he saw the message.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Che! You shut up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He ignored the messages that continued to pop up and placed the map in a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, if I handle eight people, then I can get to where Clown is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were approximately 30 pierrots in the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The equipment he had to fight them was poor.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and moved.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he slowly approached the pierrot guarding the corridor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He held his breath so the opponent didn&#x2019;t notice Tae-hyuk approaching.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The iron pipe will be fine.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He quietly activated the Violence skill and the pipe appeared in his hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He swung it and hit the back of the c&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwaduk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kihehehehehe!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a loud scream as the pierrot fell to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scream of the pierrot was louder than he thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Any guards who heard it would come flocking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? Fortunately, it seems okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The sound was loud enough to be heard on the other floors, yet there was no reaction from the pierrots.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um...perhaps they don&#x2019;t respond to each other&#x2019;s voices?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They stood still despite the mysterious shriek.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If no restraints were placed on the pierrots, they would probably attempt to catch each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like orders were given to prevent such a situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then this isn&#x2019;t secure at all. Tsk tsk. This is why the world would collapse if you use the wrong outsourcing...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After placing the collapsed clown on the floor, he headed towards his next goal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were pierrots around, so he couldn&#x2019;t do down the stairs to the underground laboratory.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to use the private passage in a corner of the building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the stairs that led to it were guarded by three pierrots.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, I need to send them elsewhere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could handle one of them silently, but taking down three of them was a &#xA0;harder task.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he suddenly came up with a good idea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He immediately checked the contents of a trash can and he was able to find the item he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It would be confusing if this wasn&#x2019;t present in a laboratory.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was an empty bottle of a drink that contained plenty of caffeine and taurine. &#xA0;</span><span style="">It was almost piled up in boxes.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is a suitable place...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed some of it and threw it at an area that the pierrots couldn&#x2019;t see.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bakak!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The pierrots turned around at the sound of the bottle breaking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Break in, i-intruder, kuhik, kuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I, go, sound...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hukik! Hugeuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The three pierrots guarding the entrance to the passage immediately ran towards where the sound was heard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Usually, one person would go to look while the others watching carefully.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the pierrots were affected by the Psychotropic Incense, and could only follow simple commands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Making a rational judgement was impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Move through this gap!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ran down the staircase while there were no guards.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tung tung tung!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The sound of the iron stairs shaking was quite loud.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he needed to pass through this area quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;If I make a mistake then he might notice. I have to strike before that!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a pierrot guarding the exit of the stairs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His movements were unsteady like he was distracted by something, but the face was covered in white powder and he was half-dressed in rags.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was wearing a bulletproof helmet on his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What type of zombie...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t strike the zombie on the back of the head to knock him unconscious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Come to think of it, they are people, not zombies.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk suppressed his laugh and choked the clown from behind with his iron pipe.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cut off the blood flow to the brain was a basic way to make the opponent lost consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kihik! Kuhuk! Keook...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The pierrot raised his arms and struggled a few times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Tae-hyuk held it too long, then the person might not wake up forever, so he would end it here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this too easy?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The best weapon Tae-hyuk learned after becoming a Noble was the Shooting Spree skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he activated it, the two attributes of Bullet Time and the bullet lines were automatically applied.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His mind accelerated and he could know the enemy&#x2019;s attack route.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally he took advantage of it in a full-scale war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a close to invincible power.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t use this skill yet since he could get to his destination so easily.</span></p><p><span style="">A smiled flashed on his face at the thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is because I grew up properly.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Everything required a process.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Clown right now wasn&#x2019;t a hardened criminal but a lunatic armed with high-tech weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;These technologies can&#x2019;t be bough at the open market so it will take some time to obtain. It is just weak timing for him...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Once he went down to the basement, there were half a dozen people for a tight defense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the core of the institute so it was naturally protected.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s not worry about saving power!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was time to break through.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk connected the power supply to Machina and moved.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
