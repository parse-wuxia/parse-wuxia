<p><span style="">Chapter 164 - 10 Year Later (End)</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The situation was literally appalling.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been one hour since gunmen had stormed the bank.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The plan was perfect.</span></p><p><span style="">Epsilon hacked the police lines to buy them time while Alpha, Beta, and Gamma collected the money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The time required to do all of that was around 300 seconds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Delta was waiting outside with the van for their escape.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Alpha wasn&#x2019;t foolish enough to flee with the same car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time they moved a certain distance, they would change the car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This way, they could run away without leaving a clue.</span></p><p><span style="">The plan was perfect from the beginning to the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then why was the situation like this? </span></p><p><span style="">However, it was too late to feel regret, as the water had already spilled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Alpha shouted in an irritated voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing? Be sure to keep the hostages! Those bastards are our lifeline!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Beta&#x2019;s face distorted as he held a gun to the hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You do it if you have a complaint! What? A perfect plan? This? Huh? If you have something to say, then tell me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Alpha was dumbfounded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Alpha was just the leader this time. </span><span style="">Beta had more experience and skills than Alpha.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, it was a big hit that Beta joined the team in the first place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a former mafia veteran who could handle skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Gamma, who hadn&#x2019;t been seen for a while, approached.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hyung-nim. Why are you fighting all of a sudden? The situation might have changed but aren&#x2019;t we allies? Smile instead of looking like you are chewing shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Gamma said with a bright expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The impatient Alpha exploded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This bastard! What are you saying? Don&#x2019;t you know why the situation is like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it because your leadership wasn&#x2019;t good?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Alpha couldn&#x2019;t endure it anymore and swung his fists at Gamma.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Come on, Alpha. We are allies until the end of the operation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just...! Fuck! This happened due to that monkey-like bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Gamma is also a team member. Forget it. First, let&#x2019;s think about getting out of here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Okay, I understand. Damn...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were only three members here, including Alpha.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Somehow, they had to overcome this crisis with their own strength.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Alpha glared at the grinning Gamma.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a complete bastard.</span></p><p><span style="">He had been put on the team as a penetration expert.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was excellent at picking locks and disabling security.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But that wasn&apos;t the problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That Satan-level bastard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Gamma had made a mistake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He accidentally caused the alarm to ring.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He tried to leave the bank, leaving the money bag in the safe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally an internal enemy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, their plan to rob and escape the bank had failed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now they were holding the customers hostage and were demanding a helicopter to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">Gamma rubbed his palms together and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Beta hyung-nim, please rest! I will manage the hostages!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shit! Once this is finished, I will kill the the broker who introduced me to that bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Beta gestured to the agitated Alpha and went to a corner to start talking to the hostages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He told Gamma to keep an eye on the hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, calm down and listen. I don&#x2019;t like it but in order to leave here, we have to show a strong appearance. If the police don&#x2019;t listen to our demands then one by one, the hostages...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Alpha and Beta were talking in secret, a familiar voice was heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, are you going to kill the hostages now? Then I don&#x2019;t have time to play around.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They turned their heads and saw the smiling Gamma.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, you should be watching the hostages...uaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">So far, Gamma had always been moving like a sloth, but now he moved at a fast pace.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Gamma caused Alpha to trip and then fell on Beta&#x2019;s back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he twisted Beta&#x2019;s arm and forced him to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? This bastard!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Beta shrieked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His arms were covered with silver handcuffs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Alpha&#x2019;s expression was shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">No way, that bastard...!</span></p><p><span style="">Gamma said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyung-nim, thank you for your performance this month. I am Detective Seo Tae-hyuk from the Gangdong Police Station. Kim Dong-soo and Bae Sung-jun, I am arresting you for special robbery and the illegal trafficking of guns. You have the right to remain silent...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack! Son of a bitch! How dare you deceive us! This scammer! Do you know who I am?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Detective Seo Tae-hyuk laughed at the agitated Kim Dong-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? I don&#x2019;t care about who you are. Rather, shouldn&#x2019;t you be wondering about where you will be going? You won&#x2019;t be able to leave for at least three years.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective-nim! I arrested Delta, who was hacking the security network, and Epsilon, who was in the car. They really were where Detective-nim said they were.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? You went through a lot of trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, it has only been a short while since Detective-nim entered. You already solved so many big cases... What is your secret?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, a burning sense of justice?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cops laughed at Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s joke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk took off the coat that he was wearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he muttered in a small voice so that no one else could hear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like I am finishing up the blacklist.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reason he was able to catch so many criminals during a short period of time after becoming a detective was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was because he knew.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a secret that Seo Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t tell anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the future for the next four years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of it was about criminals, but there were many changes due to the butterfly effect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But they were golden memories for a detective.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought about the moment 10 years ago when he decided to become a detective.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Crime skills... Now that I think about it, that really was a dreamlike year.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered the last crime skill that he got.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wasn&#x2019;t it the Proxy Attendance skill?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought it was a useless skill when he first got it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">10 years ago, Tae-hyuk was left alone in the Wolsang Institute to stop the Clown&#x2019;s Core Drive.</span></p><p><span style="">He was reminded of the newly learned crime skill as he was talking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he decided to find out what type of power it was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a skill to create an &#x2018;agent&#x2019; to do something on behalf of the caster.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In order to be used as an intermediary, I had to offer an object of equal value. And I...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He offered up the crime skills as the sacrifice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An alter ego was created to destroy the Core Drive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The thing that appeared was a ghoulish face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a hollow space where the eyes were and the mouth was ripped from ear to ear.</span></p><p><span style="">It said to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t think this is over.</span></i> <i><span style="">As long as human evil remains in the world, someone will become the God of Crime again.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Ah, was that so?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he woke up on the bed in his own house.</span></p><p><span style="">As he thought back to his high school days, Seo Tae-hyuk suddenly heard a loud noise in his ears.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two people who seemed to be security guards were in front of the bank.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, Boss-nim is coming, but who blocked the entrance with this car? It looks expensive so I can&#x2019;t remove it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! Sunbae! This car is a Lamborghini Aventador!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Do you know the car?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course! It is the most expensive model among the Lamborghinis, a man&#x2019;s romance!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...H-How much is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This has all the options. Is it around 700~800 million won?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah...that is at the level of a house I would need to be reincarnated three times in order to buy it, Who the hell would be riding this type of car?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe it is a chaebol or a celebrity? At any rate, it isn&#x2019;t for people like us...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and approached the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, that is mine. I had business so I parked it in front of the bank for a moment...I&#x2019;ll take it away right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guards stared at Tae-yuk&#x2019;s face and they started to exchange glances.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like there was a strange misconception so Tae-hyuk coughed a few times and pulled out his identification.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am Seo Tae-hyuk from the Gangdong Police Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the senior guard said with wide eyes,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Detective-nim! Ah, I&apos;m really sorry. I had a weird misconception...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, it is okay. Please do your best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bowed, took the key out of his pocket and entered his car.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, it really is his.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god. I thought he was a delinquent instead of a detective at first. But to think he would be driving an expensive car...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey! I told you not to evaluate people based on appearance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I will keep that in mind.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he parked his car elsewhere, a person called him.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, Tae-hyuk!</span></i> <i><span style="">What happened to the case?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah? Kang-suk hyung. Of course, no civilians got hurt. The culprits were arrested.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Wow!</span></i> <i><span style="">This brat.</span></i> <i><span style="">You work so hard every day.</span></i> <i><span style="">Why are you leaving work when the chief needs to stay behind and work overtime?</span></i> <i><span style="">Isn&#x2019;t this a fully developed police station?</span></i></p><p><span style="">A smile appeared on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk became a pot-bellied uncle and was now in a much higher position than before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he was still the same.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah right, don&#x2019;t you have a date today?</span></i> <i><span style="">Let me meet them next time.</span></i> <i><span style="">I wonder who it is.</span></i> <i><span style="">How pretty is she that you would hide her from me?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um... It is someone that Hyung knows.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">R-really?</span></i> <i><span style="">Now I am even more curious!</span></i> <i><span style="">I will have someone investigate this!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah... Isn&#x2019;t that an abuse of power?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then let me meet them!</span></i> <i><span style="">Sheesh.</span></i> <i><span style="">At any rate, you can leave now. Just make sure to submit the report tomorrow.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand, Superintendent Cho Kang-suk.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">-...</span><i><span style="">You are giving me goose bumps.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hung up and laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were still a few people remaining on the blacklist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He still had a lot of cases after that, but it wasn&#x2019;t a problem.</span></p><p><span style="">He had experience as the God of Crime, tangling himself up with numerous criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everyday was a fight against the new God of Crime that would someday reappear...&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was just one small problem&#x2015;.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bumped into a woman dressed in a suit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s nothing, it was probably because I wasn&#x2019;t looking.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded and suddenly got an ominous feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Wait a minute, don&#x2019;t tell me...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He placed his hands in his pockets to check if they contained something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He touched a piece of soft cloth. It was probably...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...Damn, I stole it again! A detective is going to be arrested!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk silently screamed as the woman passed by him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, it seemed like she hadn&#x2019;t noticed that something had been stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, it occasionally happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why did he keep stealing things whenever he bumped into another person?</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>God of Crime is officially complete!!!</p><p>This is the last chapter because I joined the prologue and chapter one.</p><p>A huge, huge thank you to my editor Superposhposh, who was a superstar and managed to edit all the chapters of GOC.
