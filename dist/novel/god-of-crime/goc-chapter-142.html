<p><span style="">Chapter 142 - War Between Criminals #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;W-What are with all these forks and spoons?!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gulped as he watched all the cutlery spread out before him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had never been so nervous in a fight against armed gangsters...</span></p><p><span style="">His back was moist with sweat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he hadn&#x2019;t been wearing the opera mask, then it would&#x2019;ve been obvious that he was nervous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was best to just watch what other people were doing and to follow along.</span></p><p><span style="">He shifted his gaze towards the person sitting in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her long, silver hair hung down to her waist, and her white skin seemed to reflect the sunlight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a woman several times more beautiful than the celebrities on TV.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was wearing a stunning dress that revealed her shoulders and upper chest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The perfect fit made her look even better.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah, what the? Eat! Eat! I&apos;ll follow you!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the woman just watched Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face and didn&#x2019;t eat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An awkward silence flowed between the two people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t it suit your taste?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman opened her mouth and spoke pretty good Korean.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like watching a foreign film being dubbed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I just wanted to have a meal with you. Surely it is delicious? I&#x2019;m just not familiar with it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Caterina were sitting in a French restaurant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a three-star Michelin restaurant so it was very expensive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a popular place to have dinner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She rented out this whole place. She must be rolling in money.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly clicked his tongue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, the three-star restaurant had their headquarters in Paris.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the atmosphere and chefs were similar, so there was almost the same satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the price was the same.</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, then should we leave this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Normally, he would eat at a Chinese restaurant or at home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was a commoner who didn&#x2019;t often eat outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If she asks then jajangmyeon is Phantom&#x2019;s favourite food. Still, when will I get to eat? Um. Can I get chopsticks?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the first time I&#x2019;ve eaten in a restaurant like this with a beauty like Anne.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is that so? I was wondering... You wear those clothes with such ease that I thought you were familiar with these types of places. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Caterina apologized and bowed her head.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the godfather of the Red Mafia that contained thousands of members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she was showing him a submissive attitude.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was possible because she felt favourable towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was dressed in a neat suit due to the dress code.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It fit properly, and was from a high end brand, costing at least five to six million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, it was a fake made from Counterfeit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? I saw the suit in a magazine and made it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha! You are speaking like you made it yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I did make it myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, what a good joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina covered her mouth and gently laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she took the spoon on the outside and explained,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It goes from appetizer to the mains so you use it in this sequence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is hard so can&#x2019;t I just ask for a fork?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fork? What is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.</span></p><p><span style="">How could she not know the thing that he had loved during his two years of military life?&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that time, Semon brought in a tray of food while dressed as a waiter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Lady. Please enjoy your meal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Semon. Thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He really seemed like a butler at that moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Caterina spoke after Semon left.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once the meal is over, we are going to see the Phantom of the Opera at the theater. Isn&#x2019;t it a great trend in Korea right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The more active Phantom was, the greater the number of theaters that started showing the Phantom of the Opera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a big trend among the university students.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, thanks for lending me your subordinates.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had received Caterina&#x2019;s help to deal with the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He obtained information about the Yakuza that the Red Mafia had and asked to borrow some men.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In exchange, Caterina had wanted a date with Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Investing half a day on a data in exchange for the Red Mafia&#x2019;s help wasn&#x2019;t a big deal.</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina spoke with thrilled eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is nothing, since I was originally planning on helping out this way. Anyways, I wanted to eat with Phantom like this. Thank you for pampering me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a little burdensome to have a woman who was 10 years older acting like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Well, it was cute but...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough. At any rate, I was able to easily deal with the Yakuza thanks to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes! But I have a question!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina asked while wriggling her fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I only gave you approximate information about the Yakuza. How did you know the enemy&#x2019;s base and production areas?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">All information was organic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he found a small clue, then he could track it down the line to see the big picture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t much different from putting together a jigsaw puzzle.</span></p><p><span style="">It started with a Yakuza executive who entered the country a fortnight ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was able to get a lot of information by chasing after him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is great that I was able to get Mister Park&#x2019;s voice and face.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was able to disguise himself as Mister Park, one of the higher ups in the Yakuza in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used this to gather information about the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was truly hard work.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and continued.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It is a trade secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, please~&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina grabbed his arms and acted cutely, but it didn&#x2019;t work.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, Phantom is doing well. You truly are bright, I like it.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina said with shining eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But I didn&#x2019;t think that Phantom itself would be used as a symbol.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was something that Tae-hyuk prepared to fight the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyone could become Phantom with an opera mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was Phantom who installed the bomb at the enemy&#x2019;s base, Phantom who knocked out the guards, and who was seen by lookouts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made Phantom itself a symbol by introducing numerous Phantoms.</span></p><p><span style="">The first one was the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the Phantom in charge of manufacturing bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The former Red Mafia members took charge of enemy surveillance, intelligence gathering and installing the bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even now, there were people gathered on the Internet who wished to become Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter if there was a spy among them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Masks and some missions were given to them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are welcome to wear the mask at any time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahaha~ I want to be Phantom&#x2019;s girlfriend instead. Am I lacking in any way?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wondered why there were only strange women around him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;But she likes me. I can use this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, it was Phantom she liked, not Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no need to feel any remorse.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk cut into the steak and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s do the next deal. This time, give me information about the Triads. Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, the next date will be at an amusement park!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started sweating.</span></p><p><span style="">This girl was the boss of the Red Mafia?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was worried about the future of the organization.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;They will be ruined.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina smiled softly as she checked her calendar for an appropriate date.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s talk business.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young girl turned into the mafia boss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly muttered as she gave off a strange pressure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know what tune she is dancing to.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She truly was a difficult woman to deal with.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk once again realized the truth of the world.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">He was fairly happy with his deal with Caterina.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he promised to go with her to an amusement park date two weeks later.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;She is also desperate. If she doesn&#x2019;t have Phantom, then she won&#x2019;t be able to walk the tightrope for much longer.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used his tablet PC to check the people who wanted to become Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By sending them masks and giving them commands, the number of Phantoms in the world would increase.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. This uncle...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He muttered as he looked at the profile of Shin Se-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the level of falling in love with a girl.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, there are many places where I can use him. I&#x2019;ll send him a message.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Every person on here would jump with joy if a Phantom mask was sent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to give that much fan service.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, a police officer?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The names of police officers were mixed up among the applicants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how he looked at it, they were spies.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">He could see how big Phantom had become in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Actually, I was going to use the Nuclear Bomb people. However, don&#x2019;t they know my real face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, he thought of the temporary measure of selling Phantom&#x2019;s name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it had a greater impact than he had initially thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even now, articles about people who had become Phantom were appearing on the Internet every five minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The police couldn&#x2019;t ignore it and would be hitting someone&#x2019;s house right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Clouding the eyes of the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could do several different things at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s popularity was literally exploding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled the information he got from the Phantom in charge of watching the Yakuza.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The president of Taesung Group is the Yakuza boss. Will the rats step back due to this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had set up some bugs in the Yakuza&#x2019;s offices.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a Phantom responsible for monitoring it 24 hours a day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the contents were important then it would be sent to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since there were several Phantoms in charge of this, Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t have to worry about any information being missed.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything was a system created by Sun&#x2019;s Cho Min-hyuk</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It isn&#x2019;t difficult once I view Phantom as the leader of a cult.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, the Yakuza were being attacked by their own system.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The head of the Yakuza here is dead. Then what opponent will come out now?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There were two likely outcomes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A newly promoted person will come from Japan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Or someone already here would be promoted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The most likely possibility is Mister Park.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was the organization&#x2019;s right hand man and directed the important tasks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no one else fit for the position.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Maybe the end of the mafia game will be a confrontation with him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ding dong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Delivery!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The things Caterina sent him had arrived.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how close they were, he couldn&#x2019;t tell her where the Bomber was hidden.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, Phantom was the direct contact.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had several hideouts so there was no need to worry about being caught.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The life of a fugitive was difficult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the information prepared by the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a lot of information about the Triads.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Triads is a harder opponent than the Yakuza.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza&#x2019;s default business in South Korea was the hallucinogenic drug.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used that as a small clue to find out where the Yakuza were at.</span></p><p><span style="">But the Triads was different, as they participated in fetal organ smuggling, organ trafficking, kidnapping, etc. &#xA0;</span><span style="">They did the worst crimes that weren&#x2019;t even possible in China in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to find the core and work backwards from there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are 10 more places like T Medical Centre.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There would obviously be a leader operating this, but there was no way for him to find it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, would they pop out if I keep on shaking?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the man making a bomb in his workshop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How much bombs is in stock?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung took off his safety goggles and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Including today&#x2019;s one, 13 bombs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Toad, toad. Reveal yourself, or I will blow everything up.&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
