<p><span style="">Chapter 102: Accomplice #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><i><span style="">-Hello</span></i> <i><span style="">Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i> <i><span style="">By the way, it seems like there are many uninvited guests.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader wrapped a bandage around his hand and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That son of a bitch is playing with...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The room only contained the recorded video, which told them one thing: Information from inside the police agency was leaking out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuook Who? What bastard?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader wasn&#x2019;t an idiot and didn&#x2019;t need an explanation to understand the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;m more shy than I look.</span></i> <i><span style="">Negotiations shall proceed again from somewhere else.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuoooook!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the police and counter-terrorism team members were dancing on top of Phantom&#x2019;s palms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end of Phantom&#x2019;s video.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You&#x2019;ve come a long way.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll be sorry if you return with empty hands, so</span></i> <i><span style="">I have prepared a small gift so I hope you like it.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A gift?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gulped as he looked at the tablet.</span></p><p><span style="">The message cut off there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Considering his previous experience with Phantom, the gift certainly wouldn&#x2019;t be ordinary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The table contained a video file and photos.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We just saw the video...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Detective Cho! Try not to touch Phantom&#x2019;s fingerprints!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;You were the one who almost smashed it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk barely managed to stop the words from leaving his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kang-suk was an experienced detective and knew how to deal with this situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I will pay particular attention to what you have told me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once Kang-suk pulled out leather gloves from his pocket, the leader looked dumbfounded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hum hum... Yes. Do it well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Phantom leaving fingerprints behind? Impossible...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk smiled and checked the photo file.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was nervous about the gruesome scene of a murder, but it was actually very simple.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The problem is very close by?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That was the only thing written on a sheet of paper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, something popped into Kang-suk&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before the operation started, he had investigated what this place was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had obviously been reported as a factory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It clearly doesn&#x2019;t look like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had been in a rush when he came here, so he didn&#x2019;t pay that much attention.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he realized something was strange the moment he saw the memo left behind by Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk muttered in a small voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;What is this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p>@</p><p><span style="">&quot;You will be arrested in accordance with Article 21 Clause 1 of the Medical Law!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? Y-You! Who, who are you?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The doctors are curious about who we are?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you want to go after a chicken, then you have to catch a rat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Plunge in with all your strength!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos, who were standing by to catch Phantom, opened the door and entered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Hiiiiik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then an unlicensed doctor wearing a doctor&#x2019;s coat screamed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;G-Gun! What? What is going on?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk shook his head and clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is like using a sword to cut off a nail. Mobilizing special forces to catch unlicensed doctors... Let&apos;s see... No license, illegal abortions...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The unlicensed doctor, Jung Eui-do, still couldn&#x2019;t understand the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t think the big guy in front of him was a homicide detective.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do asked carefully,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t hear from the police chief of Gangseo-gu that a crackdown was coming...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Gangseo Police Station was in charge of the area where the illegal medical center was located.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There must be secret connections for it to be operating so unabashedly like this.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but it isn&#x2019;t a crackdown. Is there anything else?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do desperately waved his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, no.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? Eh? By the way, what is going on here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk picked up the paperwork that was rolling around on the ground and placed it on the desk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was something here.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I take a look at it for a moment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he were arrested for unlicensed medical treatment, he would be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a fine not exceeding 20 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was just the maximum sentencing, however.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were released on probation if they showed their cooperation in the investigation and bribed people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was how a hospital for illegal medical treatment could operate so unabashedly.</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, there were hidden things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they investigated more than the abortions and illegal plastic surgeries...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. It looks like this place is where fetuses are killed and then trafficked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-T-There is no such thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do&#x2019;s face turned white.</span></p><p><span style="">It was 10 years imprisonment if he was caught smuggling a processed fetus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then what about smuggling raw materials?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It could increase to double that.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do said as calmly as possible,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you feel doubt then you can search the hospital. I really didn&#x2019;t do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, the remaining inventory in the hospital had been shipped several days before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would never be caught...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that so? However, this seems to be a picture of fetus trading.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out some photos from an envelope and showed them to Jung Eui-do.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heok...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do looked stunned.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Eui-do, along with the secret warehouse where they were all caught in, was captured on photo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had made a deal with a Chinese who crossed the ocean.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This couldn&#x2019;t be explained.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;S-Something seems wrong. Ah, manipulation. That is photo manipulation...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Expert analysis will quickly reveal if this was altered or not. If you don&#x2019;t have anything else to say then get up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-D-Detective-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk placed the new evidence and Phantom&#x2019;s gift into an envelope and stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk had examined the table where the phantom mask was sitting and found an envelope containing &#xA0;evidence that illegal medical activities were being conducted here, as well as the crime of selling fetuses.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to thank him for this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk scratched his head and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">After teasing the commandos leader, Phantom was sitting on his bed and staring at the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[Crime Skill: Illegal Surgery has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Various surgical operations can be done.</span></p><p><span style="">-However, treatment isn&#x2019;t possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a little early, but let&#x2019;s just say that I am discharged.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wondered about the newly acquired crime skills, but there was a more urgent matter first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk contacted Cho Kang-suk using Phantom&#x2019;s private line and used Voice Modulation to imitate Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><p>&quot;Hello Detective Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">P-Phantom...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you like my present? My proposal is still valid. Of course, if you bring uninvited guests again, then it will be the same as today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">...Sorry I couldn&#x2019;t keep my promise.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The corners of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth went up.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk, a detective with a sense of justice, was apologizing to the criminal Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a pity that he couldn&#x2019;t see what had happened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You must have suffered acting as the middle-man. Then I will give you a clue. The newly appointed police commissioner seems to want to catch me a lot. Tell the police commissioner that if he acts again this time, I will release &#x2018;it&#x2019;.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">What does that mean?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&#x2019;t have to know. Just pass it on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">- ......</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The meeting point will be delivered in 12 hours. Then let&#x2019;s finish this case well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hung up and leaned back on his pillow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The after-effects of his injuries still remained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he could restore his exhausted stamina with a good night of sleep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After upgrading to &#x2018;Noble&#x2019;, his body had become stronger than before.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But it seems like the new police commissioner has really done something wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, it was a bluff when he told Kang-suk that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe I really am a god?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There had to be something behind him if he could sit in the position of police commissioner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was aiming at that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, won&#x2019;t my bluff be true if he really comes alone to the next meeting place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If not, he would just leave a video mocking the police like this time.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, the way of figuring out if Kang-suk had a tail or not was very simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since he copied Kang-suk&#x2019;s phone during the hippo case, he could listen to all of the calls.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom doing all contact with Kang-suk wasn&#x2019;t just to build up his merits.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By wiretapping Kang-suk, he could see the movements of the police regarding Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then shall I see how rotten this police commissioner is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The new police commissioner, Chae Bum-ho, stood up after hearing the report.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He will reveal &#x2018;it&#x2019; that put me in the position of police commissioner? D-Don&#x2019;t tell me... No. It is a top secret. A mere criminal...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho muttered with a dark expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;However, Phantom was clearly involved in the dismissal of the last police commissioner. No, anybody who knows I was involved with Taesung has already...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom definitely knew something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the incident became known, then it wouldn&#x2019;t end with just removing his clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be difficult to escape being branded as a criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho&#x2019;s face distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">He knew the position that he was sitting in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most police commissioners met a disastrous end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of the past police commissioners, nine were involved in a crime, and some were still in prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been careful not to step on any toes, but the criminal wearing a mask would reveal &#x2018;it&#x2019;?</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t just wait and see.</span></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho licked his lips and contacted the Gangdong police&#xA0;superintendent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is me. Tell Detective Cho Kang-suk to listen to what Phantom wants. But be sure to report it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Yes, I understand.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Chae Bum-ho hung up and muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t think you won, Phantom. I will surely rip your mask off.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Listen to what Phantom wants.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then I will be going to see him alone?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">Detective Cho.</span></i> <i><span style="">The pride of the police agency is on your shoulders.</span></i> <i><span style="">Please make a good deal with Phantom.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I understand.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled widely as he listened to the conversation between Cho Kang-suk and the Gangdong police superintendent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That was a really simple bluff. I don&#x2019;t know his face but I would like to play poker with him. I wouldn&#x2019;t even need to use the Gambling skill...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He suddenly felt a pain in his palm while muttering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk frowned and looked at the wound.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;It really can&#x2019;t be treated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a cut from a box cutter knife on his palm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had clearly been perfectly stitched with the Illegal Surgery skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, nobody seemed to notice the wound.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Will this aggravate it? I guess I have to put a plaster on it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Illegal Surgery couldn&#x2019;t even do first aid treatment so it felt like a useless skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it had a special function.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Operation Cancel!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The small sign of the surgery that sutured the wound disappeared, and it returned to the original state before the procedure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...This could be very useful in prison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He rubbed some ointment on the wound, covered it in a plaster, and contacted Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was decided that they would meet at the meeting point right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;They might have noticed that information was being leaked and planned a double trap. So we will meet here.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk seemed perplexed when he heard that the meeting place was L Amusement Park, but the answer came soon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;ll see you in 45 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I understand.</span></i></p><p><span style="">He suggested a time that took into consideration where Kang-suk currently was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was only enough time for him to get here.</span></p><p><span style="">By the time Tae-hyuk called a taxi and got to the amusement park, there were five minutes left until the agreed meeting time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk bought a ticket to the Ferris wheel and changed his face to Shin Se-ho, whom he had met several times.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a weekday evening, but why are there so many people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help laughing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk was meeting Phantom in a place like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he thought Phantom was a simple terrorist, then Kang-suk would&#x2019;ve turned it down somehow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that he intended to cooperate since they had the same purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk called and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho Kang-suk. Have you arrived at the meeting point?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Heok...</span></i> <i><span style="">I am almost there.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Once you arrive, buy a Ferris wheel ticket and get on the next one that arrives. Then you will be able to meet me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I understand.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk went to a nearby restroom and changed clothes instead of using Counterfeit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he looked so much like Shin Se-ho that even family members wouldn&#x2019;t be able to tell them apart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Oh, there he is.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">When he got back to the Ferris wheel, he could see Kang-suk looking around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly walked over and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? If it isn&#x2019;t Detective Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ack...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ve come to play with your girlfriend. Was there an incident or something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, no.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Despite Kang-suk&#x2019;s confusion, he pretended like nothing was going on.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to meet with Phantom and have an important talk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aye~ you must be hiding something. Don&#x2019;t be like this. Let&#x2019;s share something good together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;m sorry but I am very busy. I have to meet someone right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can I join you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is a little...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk noticed that the Ferris wheel car was coming and ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no time to explain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t miss it and followed along.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Kang-suk cried out,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How did you get in? Please leave immediately.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Detective Cho Kang-suk. Who are you going to meet here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t tell you that. I&#x2019;m sorry but I really can&#x2019;t. You can make a formal protest to the police station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nope. You are right, Detective Cho Kang-suk. Weren&#x2019;t you supposed to meet someone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s body stiffened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he remembered that Shin Se-ho shouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was captured by a killer and was currently stuck in the hospital...</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gulped and looked at the man in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You, who are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The man that Detective-nim has been waiting for. Then let&#x2019;s start the deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk stared at the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom? But no matter how I look, you are Shin Se-ho...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this enough to make you believe?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the phantom mask from his pocket and placed it on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a while, he took it off to reveal Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Heok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a joke. Then let&#x2019;s start the negotiations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Rattle rattle.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Once all the passengers boarded, the Ferris Wheel started operating.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would take five minutes to go around once.</span></p><p><span style="">Everything had to be finished during that time.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
