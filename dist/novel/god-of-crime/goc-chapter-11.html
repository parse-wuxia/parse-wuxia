I will become a model student!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk lifted his head with an expression of enlightenment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The most effective way to change the future was to change the present.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Then what was the easiest thing to do right now?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The answer was easy</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Become a model student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;Yes. Raise my grades and go to university. Isn&#x2019;t that a different result than getting a job right after graduating high school?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He would never enter Sungjin Group as a guard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk was burning with the will to study. All of a sudden, sparks burst around him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Ppak!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Stop talking! Come on! Do you think this is your house? Sleeping in class and then suddenly talking nonsense! Do you have a complaint against me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">His homeroom teacher, Jung Nam-ho, was standing in Tae-hyuk with the attendance sheet.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The man seemed ready for a barrage of strikes at any time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk rubbed his head where the attendance sheet had hit.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Freaking painful.</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was fortunate that Robbery didn&#x2019;t work when he was hit with something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;Uwah... When did class start?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It seemed like some time had passed while he&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">had been</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;concentrating on his plan for the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Why don&#x2019;t you just take a break from school? You have already been absent five days this month. I wanted to see my student very much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He had been busy catching a killer and buying gifts for his sister.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He couldn&#x2019;t say this to his teacher.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was true that he had neglected his studies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;Um. I can&#x2019;t do this. I will set up some countermeasures after I get out of this lesson.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk groaned and said</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Ohh... I&#x2019;m sorry. I think I have a cold. Can I go to the infirmary?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;What did you say? A cold? You look totally fine! Are you faking right now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He was correct.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Jung Nam-ho was famous for not letting students leave school early.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">However, Tae-hyuk had a skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;If I use Voice Modulation...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk was reminded of an actor he had never met. He then manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">-You can directly imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The national actor Kim Bum-soo!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He was a super famous act</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">or</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;who had bec</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">o</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">me well-known after his role as a father with a terminal illness in a drama.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">His dying performance&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">had been</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;almost at the level of a god.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">At that moment, it</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;was reproduced by Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Cough! T-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">eacher-nim... Really. I feel like I&#x2019;m dying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was a voice that seemed like he was about to cough up blood at any moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Voice Modulation didn&#x2019;t just end with changing the voice.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It copied a person&#x2019;s distinct accent or way of speaking. Any special skills related to the voice was also possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">This</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;was a fraudulent skill with endless utilization possibilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Voice Modulation</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;was cl</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">early&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">on a different level in com</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">parison to</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;Robbery.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Eh? Are you really sick? Where did you go that you would catch a cold? What a fool.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The entire class laughed at the words that came from Teacher Jung Nam-ho&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">There was only one man who didn&#x2019;t laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Teacher-nim</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">, i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">gnore the fool who gave up on life and continue with the lesson.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Ah, yes, Sung-kwang! Let&#x2019;s start the class!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Jung Nam-ho&#x2019;s attitude changed by 180 degrees.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Park Sung-kwang was well</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">educated</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;and his father was a politician.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He was a model student who was different from the troublemaker Tae-hyuk, who had always skipped school.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In addition, h</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">is</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;cold appearance and celebrity looks meant he was always popular with women.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The sounds of&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>k</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>yaa!!</em></span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201D;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;could be heard when he passed by.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Jung Nam-ho quickly found the class president.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Class president! Take Seo Tae-hyuk to the infirmary.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;Yes</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;I understand</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">A frail voice answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">An Eun-young, the class president, rose from her seat and approached Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">She hesitated to reach out a hand to Tae-hyuk, who was a troublemaker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;T-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">ae-hyuk...

I&#x2019;m just feigning an illness.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk started to leave the classroom with An Eun-young&#x2019;s support. However, Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s eyes made him uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It almost contained a killing intent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;Um? Did I steal his money or something?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk had no contact with Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Park Sung-kwang was the son of a politician and a model student. As such, he always had friends gathering around him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He was t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">he so-called influential figure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In contrast, Seo Tae-hyuk had often skipped school due to his part time work.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In the end, he was treated as a troublemaker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Even though they were in the same class, Tae-hyuk had never spoken with him before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&apos;Did I see correctly? He</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2019;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">s looking at me right?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk walked</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;slowly</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;to the back of the class with An Eun-young&#x2019;s help.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Park Sung-kwang was looking at them with an almost predatory expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;wasn&#x2019;t mistaken.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;...I&#x2019;ve seen th</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">at gaze</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;before.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was in the prison. Park Sung-kwang seemed like the guards when they looked at the inmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The distance between the two people was&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">decreasing</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In the end, Tae-hyuk passed right by Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">At that moment, Tae-hyuk laughed and called out to Sung-kwang</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Park Sung-kwang.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Sung-kwang looked into Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes without saying anything</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">, but a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;vicious contempt was seen in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was like he was irritated that Tae-hyuk was even breathing the same air as him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Then&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk said</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Your fly is open.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s expression distorted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He realized that the zipper of his pants was open.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk shrugged and walked out of the room with An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">* &#xA0; &#xA0; * &#xA0; &#xA0; *</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Um, I think I&#x2019;m okay now. I can go alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk said as he left the classroom and turned off the Voice Modulation skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He instantly turned from a dying patient to a normal high school student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x201C;B-</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">ut... Teacher-nim...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">An Eun-young was a timid, petite girl.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">So, i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">t was inconvenient for him to move since he had to lean down to get support.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">An Eun-young was a brilliant student who had never failed to get 1st place ever since she had entered the school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">She had a rivalry with Park Sung-kwang who was always 2nd place in the school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Furthermore, her credibility with the teachers was high due to her sincere nature.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Thus, she had been in charge of the class since the 1st grade in high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;In the end, didn&#x2019;t she get into S University with a full scholarship?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The nation&#x2019;s top university.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">For Tae-hyuk, it was just a distant story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s walk to the infirmary together. Will that be okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;Eung...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk looked at An Eun-young&#x2019;s back as he walked towards the infirmary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">At that moment, he came up with a good idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;That reminds me, doesn&#x2019;t she stay after school to teach other students?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Her explanations were easy to understand</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;so her study group was very popular.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">If Tae-hyuk wanted to go to university with his sister, he needed to raise his grades.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;Yes</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;I should ask her to teach me.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Then he would become a model student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He thought about how he could ask it naturally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">As he was thinking about it, he felt a vibration in his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Brr!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;Hiik!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was an unexpected situation, so he barely prevented himself from screaming.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&apos;What is it again?!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">[Seo Tae-hyuk]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">-Title: God of Crime</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">-Rating: Commoner (Lacking conditions for upgrade)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">-Skills Possessed: Robbery (Lv 1)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Voice Modulation (Lv 1)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;???</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It was an alarm announcing the emergence of a new skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">There was only one thing it meant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">A crime was happening in the area.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">At first, it was the pickpocket. The second was voice phishing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Then...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk thought of all the people he met today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t Noona or Tae-min. Then... Teacher Jung Nam-ho or Park Sung-kwang. Also, An Eun-young.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">One of these people were associated with a crime.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva. Unlike before, there were three candidates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">It would be easy to figure out if he knew what the crime was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror that only displayed &#x2018;???&#x2019; with resentful eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">His&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">thoughts</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;was complicated.

First, I should determine who the perpetrator is.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">However, An Eun-young&#x2019;s condition was strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&quot;U</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">h,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">eung...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">She moaned as she started swaying and then began to fell.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">If she hit then cement floor</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#xA0;she was likely to&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">b</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">ecome seriously injured.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">In the end, Seo Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t hesitate to grab An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"><em>Heavy!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">He could feel something big that didn&#x2019;t fit her slender body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">&#x2018;She did look tired</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">, but t</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">o think she would suddenly fall down...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">An Eun-young had dark circles around her eyes.
