<p><span style="">Chapter 62 - It seems like something is going on #4 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pant... Pant...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started breathing roughly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The status of his body wasn&#x2019;t good because he had used extreme crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But I finished...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately erased Atlantis from his mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he kept remembering it then it felt like his brain would burst.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Either way, there was no time left.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed the blueprint and returned to where the people were gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, he is here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was less than five minutes but there was a lot of nervousness on people&#x2019;s faces.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their lives were in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-The blueprint?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Here it is.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out an A3 paper out of his sleeve and showed it to people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It contained everything about Atlantis.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo, who was watching from the side, started to scoff.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t printed but hand-drawn. Is this correct?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&#x2019;t have faith then you can go where you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo had a worried expression but he didn&#x2019;t have any other options.</span></p><p><span style="">He poured out his doubts towards Tae-hyuk towards the other guests.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can we really trust him? All of a sudden, he suddenly got a nice blueprint of this place. The contents are also doubtful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, a middle-aged man walked forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am an architect. If you feel doubt then I can show you the certification in my wallet. Can I take a look at that blueprint?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p><span style="">The water had already reached his waist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be a close call, even if they started to escape now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what would happen if he refused?</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, only Yoo Tae-soo was suspicious; however, it might spread even more.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was better to take a little time then to escape with non-cooperative people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Take a look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do it as quickly as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The architect put on glasses and started to examine the blueprint created by Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After one minute, he said with wide eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a perfect blueprint. The scale, perspective and marks are all unquestionable. It is made so well that I want to employ the architect who drew it. Most of the time, it isn&#x2019;t good to draw by hand. It reminds me of how I used to work a long time ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Those who were watching sighed with relief at the architect&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know it is made well. Is there evidence that it is the exact design of this place?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo still had a doubtful expression on his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk spat at him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yoo Tae-soo, I don&#x2019;t know why you are so dissatisfied, as there is already no time. Stop. If you feel doubt then it doesn&#x2019;t matter if you stay here. I don&#x2019;t have a mission to save everyone who is here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said, causing Yoo Tae-soo to laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Look at this! How shameless! Do you believe him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes and glared at Yoo Tae-soo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t feel troubled about saving that guy now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s body condition was a bit better, then he would&#x2019;ve hit him with a steel pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t have enough stamina to use the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was at his limit due to the extreme crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, Yoo Ha-yang glared at Yoo Tae-soo and scolded him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You. Don&#x2019;t you know that Seo Tae-hyuk is struggling and risking his life to save people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I don&#x2019;t know what happened but his body has turned into a mess.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang stared at Tae-hyuk with moist eyes before asking in a trembling voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Tae-hyuk, are you okay? What happened? You sound like you are dying...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">She was a really good girl.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m fine. First, let&#x2019;s think about escaping.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes. I understand.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s words showed an authenticity that couldn&#x2019;t be acting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people felt confidence and started yelling at Yoo Tae-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing now? Do you feel good? Why aren&#x2019;t you trying to save us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you can&#x2019;t take responsibility then stay quietly in a corner!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you are so disgruntled then go on your own!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo instantly became isolated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he showed no signs of concern on his face at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He leisurely pulled out a gun, like he was taking out a business card.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was already thinking about that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo smiled as he aimed the muzzle at Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people around him paled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would be nice if you didn&#x2019;t move. Ah. I will correct myself. Feel free to move, and then you will suffer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo said with a sneer,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am in a difficult situation right now, so I have to live alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. I am in charge of this place. And if you guests live then I will have to go to jail. Hah! I can&#x2019;t allow you to appear on TV as you like. Staying still? I never issued such instructions. But why is this all my responsibility?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you want to kill the rest of us so you can live?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. I can manipulate everything that happened here at will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? You completely crazy bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Don&apos;t worry. I will make sure that the public knows about your sacrifices. And you will live forever in their hearts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuck! How many people are here now? Can you deal with this many people alone? Everyone pounce!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A man angrily rushed towards Yoo Tae-soo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo fired at the man with a calm face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kyaaak!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sparks flew as the man collapsed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I won&#x2019;t stop those who want to go to the other side with him. There are a limited number of bullets and only 10 minutes remain, so first come first served.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, sacrifices were needed in order to overthrow Yoo Tae-soo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But how many people would be able to do that for something they met today?&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, no one moved and the strange standoff continued.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the meantime, water was constantly rising so they could tell the limit.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo aimed the gun at Tae-hyuk again and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hand me the blueprint unless you want to die right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a slightly difficult expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he spoke loud enough for others to hear,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can be a hero if I use my body to subdue that person now. Of course, I will die from a hole in my body but others will be saved.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Do you really want to do that? Do you want to demonstrate such a great sacrifice?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I&apos;m not a hero. At best, I am just a criminal. Yes. I understand. I will hand the blueprint over to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the people shrieked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, all the people remaining here would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, no one else rushed forward.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Going forward meant they would be killed by Yoo Tae-soo&#x2019;s gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One person had already died. If 10 people sacrificed themselves, then the rest could live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the ones that went forward...</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang approached Tae-hyuk while there was a ruckus and spoke in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I will get that person&#x2019;s attention. Meanwhile, you will knock him down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. No matter how great your physical abilities are, even Noona can&#x2019;t avoid all the bullets.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-But somebody should do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. You will die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It&#x2019;s okay. No, it doesn&apos;t matter. I made up my mind after listening to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words. If somebody has to be a hero, I will do it. Remember that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang smiled brightly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the face of a hero who decided to sacrifice herself to save others.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, it will be Noona who dies here alone. Is it really okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared at Yoo Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her eyes were filled with a strong will.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">According to his memories, she was a weird thief who stole from chaebols.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was there a reason for this?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t understand it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he couldn&#x2019;t let Yoo Ha-yang die here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would rather you walk away from here than me. In fact, I have a plan to deal with Yoo Tae-soo.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s face turned red.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? If you have something like that then say it quickly! If you plan to hit him alone...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised a finger to his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang closed her mouth with amazement.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yoo Tae-soo I understand. Here is the blueprint. Instead, you can&#x2019;t hurt anyone else here. You have to promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hahaha! It is understandable. Humans are selfish. There aren&#x2019;t any fools who would sacrifice themselves for others!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was one such fool.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Yoo Ha-yang and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;N-Now we will all die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;N-No! I don&#x2019;t want to die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Please spare me. I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The people started begging for their lives. &#xA0;</span><span style="">They were thinking extreme thoughts.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo fired at the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">There were no longer any protests as Tae-hyuk handed the blueprint to Yoo Tae-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would like to thank you for using Atlantis Theme Park today. You can&#x2019;t come back. Enjoy your remaining time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Yoo Tae-soo quickly entered the vents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He left with one last remark.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will tell the world that there was a stupid hero who wanted to save everyone here but couldn&#x2019;t do it. Wuhahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Catch him!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t shoot his gun as he entered the vent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, they were safe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, there were those who moved to catch Yoo Tae-soo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they couldn&#x2019;t move quickly because of the rising water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They missed him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Damn...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&apos;re all dead!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the corpse of the man with a gentle expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He took a moment of silence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man had died in order to save everyone, but there was no one mourning his death.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In front of the hero, Tae-hyuk slowly bowed his head.</span></p><p><span style="">When he raised it, he was the criminal Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The hero died alone, and only the culprit survived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the real blueprint.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Wait a minute. T-That!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Another blueprint?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The people shrieked in glee.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought it would be like this so I made a fake.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha! Amazing. We&#x2019;re saved! We can live!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew that his physical condition wasn&#x2019;t good, and from his previous memories, he remembered that there was only one survivor on the fourth underground floor, the floor that had the most victims.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Tae-soo, the owner of this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reason he survived then wasn&#x2019;t too different to the situation now.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You don&#x2019;t know that map is wrong and will be moving towards hell. Once I get out, I will tell the story about the clown who tried to kill everyone here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hurriedly led the people out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t even waste one second.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk first passed the blueprint to the architect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was skilled so he would lead the people from the front.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What will you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will look at the situation and follow when suitable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Then I will definitely lead people from the front. R-Really... Thank you!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The architect bowed humbly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Say thank you if you survive. Now hurry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people calmly followed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s instructions.</span></p><p><span style="">The water was already up to their chests.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the speed was getting faster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was obvious that this space would be completely covered in water in a few minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Under these circumstances, more than 20 people entered the vents.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it due to the sacrifice of the nameless hero?&#xA0;</span><span style="">No one fell into panic.</span></p><p><span style="">There were only five people remaining.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk told Yoo Ha-yang who was helping the people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. Stop now and escape first. I will follow right behind you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What? Follow right... Do you want to see my underwear? It&#x2019;s too fast. That&#x2019;s it. I will send people until the end. Go first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no time to argue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&apos;ll go first. Noona, be sure to come along.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang laughed at him.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t look back as he entered the vent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was a man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So she liked it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, everybody hurry! I will kick your butt if the distance increases!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Understood.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The people remaining escaped one by one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang remained until the end, pushing them from behind to allow them to enter the vent easier.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;N-Now I will get out...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that last minute, the place where she was present was completely submerged in water.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">At first, she thought he was just a kid.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he wasn&#x2019;t like that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was amazing to see him bargain with Big Mama and finally recover the thing that he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, she saw him saving many people from the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the appearance of a hero that Yoo Ha-yang longed for.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Daddy.</span></i> <i><span style="">Why did you fire the employees?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It is in order to live.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Then the fired employees...</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ha-yang.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t forget that you will also have to live this way.</span></i></p><p><span style="">- ......</span></p><p><span style="">Something popped up in Yoo Ha-yang&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Signs of her life, words she remembered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She felt everything so vividly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was this a kaleidoscope?</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">F-Father.</span></i> <i><span style="">Why is the security so easy to penetrate?</span></i> <i><span style="">If something goes wrong then their personal information might be leaked and they might become the victim of voice phishing or card fraud!</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It doesn&#x2019;t really matter.</span></i> <i><span style="">It will never happen anyway.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">We have to prevent such a thing.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">-Don&apos;t pay attention to it.</span></i> <i><span style="">Anyway, it&#x2019;s not the people giving us money whose personal information is stolen.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">T-That...</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">No matter what we do, it won&#x2019;t change.</span></i> <i><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang.</span></i> <i><span style="">Get rid of the illusion that you are a hero.</span></i> <i><span style="">You are just a security company employee.</span></i> <i><span style="">Aren&#x2019;t you parachuting off me?</span></i></p><p><span style="">- ......</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang hated chaebols.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people sat on their thrones and hated ruling over so many people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wanted to show them a spicy taste.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, Yoo Ha-yang decided to become a thief who only stole from chaebols.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was confident in her physical abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She also had extensive knowledge from working at the security company.</span></p><p><span style="">But in the end, she didn&#x2019;t do anything right and would die like this...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Strangely, she didn&#x2019;t feel regret.</span></p><p><span style="">In the last minute, she had become the person she had been longing for.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang felt something warm before she lost consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ha-yang! Yoo Ha-yang! Steady yourself!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook Ha-yang&#x2019;s body and called her name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the same time, he slapped her cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U...Uh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She groaned as water poured out from her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang slowly opened her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face was right in front of her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the first thing she saw.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked confused.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it because she almost died?</span></p><p><span style="">By the way, her name came out from his mouth. She had obviously never given him her real name.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How did you get my name...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That isn&#x2019;t important now! I was really worried because you didn&#x2019;t open your eyes after artificial respiration!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah... artificial respiration...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang raised a finger to her lips, which were wet with someone&#x2019;s saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My first kiss...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo. This Noonim... I rescued you from dying and crossing Jordan River, so it isn&#x2019;t your first kiss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha... I-I lived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course! What did I say? I saved Noona&#x2019;s life didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk had obviously rescued her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang faced turned red as she remembered a warm touch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Had he been waiting near the entrance of the vent because he was worried about her?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, reporters and police are outside. Noona and I don&#x2019;t have to meet those people. Let&#x2019;s just run away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang realized her own heart when she was prepared to die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a little young but obviously...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh right, I need Noona&#x2019;s help with something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;ll help you with anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to catch the culprit of this bombing case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Bomber Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">From now on, Tae-hyuk would move to catch him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be a bonus if he could learn a new crime skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Tae-hyuk thought about Kim Tae-sung, something on the Demon Revealing Mirror caught his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">[Two affinity points have disappeared due to the destruction of the bond.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Eh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">Come to think of it, there were two people who didn&#x2019;t escape.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man who threw his body in order to stop Yoo Tae-soo, and Yoo Tae-soo himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, his relationships with them had vanished.</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk was upset over the loss, Yoo Ha-yang hugged his arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s hurry.
