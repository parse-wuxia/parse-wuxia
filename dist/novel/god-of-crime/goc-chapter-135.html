<p><span style="">Chapter 135 - Everybody Gather!</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared blankly into the air as he went to school for the first time in a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After entering the third grade, he had gone abroad to study.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Blue Dragon Prison was out at sea, so it wasn&#x2019;t exactly a lie.</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, it had been more than a month since he sat in a chair and took classes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was noisy in the classroom, due to the presence of a dark horse that appeared after a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you see the results of yesterday&#x2019;s mock exam?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is really perfect.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There were two people in our school who got perfect scores.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? I know one. Who is the other person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who? Over there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...Seo Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Class President has already been accepted into S University. She can pick any university like they are ice creams.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Their chatter entered his ears, but Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t care.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also received comments on the Internet about Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was just cute.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror to check his stats.</span></p><p><span style="">-Stats: Stamina (67), Intelligence (70), Agility (55), Dexterity (64)</span></p><p><span style="">Particularly noteworthy was the additional 20 points in intelligence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been able to reach 50 points easily with An Eun-young&#x2019;s help. However, he hadn&#x2019;t studied with her after that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it rose at a tremendous pace while fighting other criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia art forgery case. the Triads&#x2019; organ trafficking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After the cult incident with the Yakuza, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s stats increased enormously.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the case of his stamina, it went up by 10 after fighting against dozens of mafia members.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I literally took a giant leap.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Yesterday, mock tests were conducted all across the country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He thought it was a good opportunity to see how his head had improved.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The result was a perfect score for all subjects.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also finished the tests with 10 minutes to spare.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is just 70 points. If I get 100 points, then can&#x2019;t I win a Noble Prize?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was more interesting to plot crimes than to study.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyways, his stats seemed to ascend when he specialized in crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A criminal should have a good head.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There was still some time before homeroom would start.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out his phone from his pocket and accessed the Internet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The incident from a few days ago was still heating up the news columns.</span></p><p><span style="">[Declaring war on the mafia who encroached on South Korea? Phantom&#x2019;s purpose.]</span></p><p><span style="">It was an obvious gossip story that he knew the contents without even clicking on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But there was an eye-catching ripple.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">No matter how incredible Phantom is, it will be hard for him to deal with the whole mafia alone.</span></i> <i><span style="">Even if the mafia were chased out, they can just start operating secretly.</span></i> <i><span style="">Will we ever be able to get rid of their weeds?</span></i> <i><span style="">It will remain the same.</span></i> <i><span style="">Even if one sprout is pulled out, two more will grow in its place until the person is exhausted.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The debate continued.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It made a lot of sense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t appear in the news but the mafia were still active in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Phantom&#x2019;s declaration of war wasn&#x2019;t a prank call.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would let the opponent know how much damage he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">One person alone couldn&#x2019;t deal with the whole mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;But I am sorry. In this case, I&#x2019;ve prepared a plan.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, it couldn&#x2019;t be implemented right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were a few things that needed to be taken care of before he could smash the mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First...&#x2019;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Bam!</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that moment, his eyes flashed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! Tae-hyuk! What are you doing? Class has begun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was Jung Nam-ho, his teacher, who spoke with his unique dialect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had hit the back of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk rubbed his head and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uhh...Teacher-nim. Doesn&#x2019;t it seem like your treatment towards me hasn&#x2019;t changed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This brat. I will treat all my students the same, even if you ended up being first in the nation. Aigoo, &#xA0;I didn&#x2019;t think I would get you for two years in a row.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Nam-ho was still Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s third year homeroom teacher.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the classmates changed, but he was still together with An Eun-young and Jung Nam-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since starting to work as Phantom, Tae-hyuk had become so busy that he needed two bodies to do everything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, he came to school consistently due to two people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, please bring your sister on the Friday&#xA0;written here. I have something to say to her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? N-Noona?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shook as Jung Nam-ho requested the presence of his guardian.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surely no one knew that he was the Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Did Jung Nam-ho perhaps see him with the Nuclear Bomb members?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes! It is Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s third year. You have to decide your future path.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a convinced look.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In a words, the guardian had to come for career counseling.</span></p><p><span style="">Jung Nam-ho told him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You worked hard on the exams. They are grades that anyone would desire. Effort never betrays you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk was thinking about something else.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Then it is time to talk with him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he visualized someone&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;&#x2014; I will punish them!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The young boss of the Triads, Li Zheng, struck his desk after seeing the video from the UCC site.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Boss...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The subordinates trembled at the boss&#x2019; agitated state.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their boss was someone who always kept his cool, even when subordinates were lost.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet he was agitated this time.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng glared at his subordinates with blazing eyes then tore up the reports on his desk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were the results of various plans to bring Phantom into the Triads.</span></p><p><span style="">All of them failed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He hates money, hates honor, and hates women. Even if he dies, he doesn&#x2019;t want to go under another person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He lost count of the sweet fruits that he offered Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the target didn&#x2019;t bite the apple.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng was furious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Then we have to kill him before he falls into someone else&#x2019;s hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng calmed down and ordered his subordinates to summon his special forces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kukukuk... Even Phantom wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take on dozens of armed men. Tell them that anyone who obtains Phantom&#x2019;s neck will be give a three million dollar reward. Let&#x2019;s see how much he can do alone. I might be using a flamethrower to catch a rat in a warehouse, but I have to let him know that he can be killed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the door opened and an agitated man in a black suit entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Boss... P-Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...do you know the matter from a few days ago? The bosses of the Red Mafia mobilized armed men with powerful firearms to kill the &#x2018;Princess.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. I think I recall it. What does it have to do with Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The subordinate dropped his head and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Phantom rescued her from the Red Mafia&#x2019;s hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What?! Wait a minute. The opponents were armed with weapons! I clearly remember that anti-tank rockets and sniper rifles were mobilized, yet one man saved the princess and got away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng got goosebumps.</span></p><p><span style="">The fact that the Red Mafia was engaged in a civil war was well known.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would obvious fight among themselves and self-destruct.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That&#x2019;s why he hadn&#x2019;t worried about the movements of the Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">But what was this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom stopped the assassination of the boss?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me... Phantom has gone under the princess of the Red Mafia?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. It is the worst case scenario.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have to absolutely stop it! Phantom doesn&#x2019;t need to join the Triads. However, he shouldn&#x2019;t become the Red Mafia&#x2019;s subordinate!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I will keep that in mind!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But... He really is great. Saving the boss from dozens of armed people. Yes, what about the damage to both sides?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It would be preferable if Phantom got a big injury and died.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the expression of his subordinate was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like opening a box that shouldn&#x2019;t be opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell me. What the hell happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-They were wiped out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom killed all of his opponents and strolled out of there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng sat down like he saw a ghost.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom was a rodent who was an eyesore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the problem was that his abilities were real.</span></p><p><span style="">Another subordinate listening from the side asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-Boss. Should I convene the special forces?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shut up!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the paintings he forged to Big Mama&#x2019;s pawn shop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Mama clapped with a big smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo! You succeeded in stealing it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Two of Gauguin&#x2019;s oil paintings.</span></p><p><span style="">The result of the careful examination was that it was all &#x2018;genuine.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bought information from her by saying that the Sun Cult had some Gauguin paintings.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, he had to show her the results.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the future, her help would be needed to fight the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he had to do this.</span></p><p><span style="">Paul Gauguin&apos;s paintings were traded for hundreds of millions of won to collectors.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Of course, it is a fake.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was an intellectual in the art forgery business.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was selling fake goods to such a person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, some work was needed to create these pieces.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, his Forgery crime skill was fully activated to create the most plausible fakes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he used Counterfeit on top of that.</span></p><p><span style="">In such a way, he managed to create fakes that could even deceive Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although the duration of Counterfeit had increased due to an attribute, it was still only 30 minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Big Mama wouldn&#x2019;t look so carefully after purchasing it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is the saying, the person who was deceived is in the wrong?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was reminded of Big Mama&#x2019;s motto.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A person who didn&#x2019;t know it was a fake as they were buying it was the one at fault.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was literally a complete crime.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I can give you 100 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two paintings of Gauguin were traded for hundreds of millions of won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But 100 million.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved the abacus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Usually, stolen goods were traded at 20~30% of the market price.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A lot was taken away as a commission fee.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a very conscientious price.</span></p><p><span style="">Above all, Big Mama only paid in cash.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, she gave him an excellent price.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For her, Tae-hyuk was a trading partner that she didn&#x2019;t want to give up.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll accept 70 million. Instead, please give me some information for the remaining amount of money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. You have grown a lot when it comes to business.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. I am a child growing every day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once Tae-hyuk asked about the Yakuza who were active in South Korea, Big Mama gazed at him with suspicious eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Have you been making a bad friend these days? In particular, someone who has a hobby of wearing a strange mask?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, do you think that I know Phantom? I am just filled with burning patriotism these days. I heard that the Yakuza are gathering Goryeo celadon (Korean pottery from the Goryeo era that is pale green-blue in color). I want to try and steal it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Goryeo celadon? Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can&#x2019;t spill this anywhere since I&#x2019;m putting a lot into this. Of course, I will deal with Big Mama. Is this enough for you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I will do it. But this time it will take longer. Please wait at least three days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Three days. Right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He thought it would take at least one week.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it was just three days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Mama was truly the madame of the information world.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk waved at Big Mama as he left the pawn shop.</span></p><p><span style="">A fake piece of artwork that he spent half a day on was sold for a lot of money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would also get the information he wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Mama really was generous.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he walked in an alley,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since I have nothing to do for three days, shall I break out the Bomber?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started collecting the parts necessary to fight the mafia.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
