<p><span style="">Chapter 110 - Jail War #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It came...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk screamed wildly as he opened the door of the investigation headquarters so roughly that it seemed like it would break.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the only person inside was Hyun-ho, but it still felt important.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Hyun-ho was dozing off in his chair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked up at Kang-suk with wide and sleepy eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho muttered with a bemused expression,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sunbae, is it time for lunch already?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It sounds like you didn&#x2019;t hear it so I&#x2019;ll say it again. The thing we have been waiting for has come!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmphhh... I guess you did come for lunch.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk put the yawning Hyun-ho into a headlock.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keooook... I-I surrender! I give up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you awake now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is the uproar all of a sudden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look at this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk dropped a thick envelope onto the table and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I brought this here since you&#x2019;ve been asking for it, yet you were sleeping very well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho took the envelop with less sleepy eyes and read the text written outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then his eyes widened and he shouted,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were working properly, Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The information from Phantom that the investigation headquarters had been waiting for had finally arrived after 2 weeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Look at your eyes now. You should&#x2019;ve done that sooner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae! Can I open it straight away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk and Hyun-ho carefully opened Phantom&#x2019;s letter, like it would break if they touched it the wrong way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a tremendous amount of material on Park Sung-yul inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Jackpot. Not all of the cases that Park Sung-yul confessed are in there, but there are at least five of them. If all of this was done by Park Sung-yul, then he won&#x2019;t be able to leave the prison for the rest of his lives.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Five? That&#x2019;s more than I initially thought...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The words written were roughly at the prophetic level of Nostradamus.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In addition, each puzzle is hard. This won&#x2019;t be completed in just a day or two.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The puzzles would take a few months, or maybe even a few years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The degree of difficulty was much harder than he thought, so his head started to hurt.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk moaned and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At first, I thought he confessed to his crime after three years in order for the evidence to disappear,ut he might have needed that time just to create all these puzzles. By the way, can you solve it? It looks pretty difficult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho smiled so that his teeth were visible and shook his index finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sunbae, have you ever heard the saying that a created puzzle can always be solved?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I&#x2019;ve heard of it... Maybe some time ago?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will prove it by solving Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s puzzles... Eek.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, a strange sound emerged from Hyun-ho&#x2019;s mouth as he rummaged through the materials with a confident expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk wondered what Hyun-ho saw and followed his gaze.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a note left behind by Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I have put together what I reasoned for the busy detectives.</span></i> <i><span style="">I hope it helps with the investigation.</span></i> <i><span style="">Don&apos;t get me wrong, this is just a service because I am bored.</span></i></p><p><span style="">His comments on the problems were written in red pen like a teacher.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk read it and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? Isn&#x2019;t it pretty plausible? All of these answers seem correct. You would have noticed it with one glance. Why isn&#x2019;t your face pleased?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho dropped his head and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted to solve it myself! Isn&#x2019;t this the same as writing the name of the killer on the first page of a mystery novel?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, is that so?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk snorted and attempted an additional attack on the back of Hyun-ho&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Director-nim! Remains have been found!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk ran towards the place where the sound was heard and saw the body, which had completely rotted so that only white bones were left, buried deep in the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for the effort. I&#x2019;ll call the coroner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A corpse was really in the place that Phantom had mentioned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the last one.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk called Coroner Park Min-soo on the radio.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It took less than five minutes for a man in a white robe to rush over.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kang-suk. You went through a lot of effort. Ah, should I call you Director now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just speak comfortably. There are only two people in my investigation headquarters, and the rest are just </span><span style="">support people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There aren&#x2019;t many chances to hear yourself being called Director, so you should take this opportunity to listen to it often.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Min-soo laughed and checked the condition of the newly discovered body.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Won&#x2019;t it be hard to figure out the identity again this time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The status is similar to the other bodies. Usually bodies in the ground don&#x2019;t rot well. It is called Casper&#x2019;s Law of Decomposition...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to explain. I also went to the police academy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Casper&#x2019;s Law of Decomposition stated that if temperature and humidity were equal, the ratio of a body decomposing in air, water and the ground became 1:2:8. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I shouldn&#x2019;t ignore a detective. At any rate, a body buried in the ground for just a few years wouldn&#x2019;t be decomposed like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it must be treated with special chemicals. It is too well decomposed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know what it is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I need to go back and do a detailed autopsy... It might take a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t stop with the discovery of the body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they couldn&#x2019;t find anything to identify the body, then this case would fall into a maze again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The first body found wasn&#x2019;t like this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;With that one, I could determine the gender with the body type, and the identity can be found with dental records. It will just take some time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk groaned in response.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want Park Sung-yul to properly confess to his crimes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he was a person who liked having the police dancing on the palms of his hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Over time, the evidence would have disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What weapon could be used to open his mouth?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk wanted to discover all of the crimes committed by Park Sung-yul in order to appease the dead victims.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His brain started working at full strength.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A person who is a specialist in mind games... ah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, something flashed through Kang-suk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Won&#x2019;t that guy be able to intimidate Park Sung-yul? In addition, he is right next to him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk recalled his contract with Phantom and decided to add a few lines to it.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;By now, they would&#x2019;ve realized that they can&#x2019;t figure out the identity of the body. The puzzle would just deepen. Won&#x2019;t he want to know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone else was thinking the same thing as Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was Phantom who was up to his own tricks.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and looked at the ship for transporting goods that was docked in the port.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A ship carrying food and other necessities arrived at Blue Dragon once every three days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Until a few years ago, supplies came to Blue Dragon Prison every day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the number of times decreased for some reason.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe he wanted to prevent as many outsiders as possible from coming.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden was growing drug farms here, and he did everything in his power to stop it from being exposed.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;So this trick is possible.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk carried some materials and hid it in the engine room while the crew was gathered outside of the boat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was something that was easy to destroy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now, it would be impossible for the ship to sail properly without any repairs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would take a week to fix it properly.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There are two ships. First of all, I need to make sure they don&#x2019;t operate.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk exited the boat with a casual expression and returned to his room.</span></p><p><span style="">A day passed by.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He heard that the supply ships were broken from the guards who didn&#x2019;t filter their words around the prisoners.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled with satisfaction as he relaxed.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, there was an uproar among the guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the warden convened an emergency meeting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of the guards raised his hand and asked a question,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If this continues, won&#x2019;t the inmates starve?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The answer was given by someone standing next to him,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it, that absolutely won&#x2019;t happen. There are two supply ships in the first place, so it is okay for one to fail. Food is also stored in the prison to prepare for this situation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see, then I don&#x2019;t need to worry. Well, even if those guys starve...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As long as a god doesn&#x2019;t play a joke, the food supply won&#x2019;t be cut off. Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The other guards also laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, there was a god in the prison.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This way, no supplies will enter Blue Dragon Prison for the next week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he broke the engine of the second supply ship.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once this became known, the warden and guards would clearly panic.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to finish one task before that.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It will take around 30 minutes to complete the logistics work.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk went back to the prison and headed for the warehouse where food was stored.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Except for a napping logistics officer, no one else was there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were ingredients piled up like mountains.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was enough food for hundreds of people to eat for a few weeks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it is showtime!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a small vial of bacteria that caused symptoms of gastroenteritis.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Simply put, it was food poisoning bacteria.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Even if it was in a bottle, I brought this into the prison in my stomach. Truly crazy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was one of the things he brought along with sleeping pills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk started to distribute it among the food ingredients in the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just like pouring salt on food, the specially cultured bacteria would grow.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t forget to sprinkle it in the refrigerator.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyun also added it to the meat that was as frozen as a stone and purposely sprayed water on the power cord.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Pajik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The electricity went out and the refrigerator was turned off. The cold still remained, but it would disappear quickly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Always be careful about leaks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a few days, no one would be able to eat any of these foods.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Inside the fridge, bananas were stacked for tonight&#x2019;s dessert.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk peeled a bunch of them then put the white banana in his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Only amateurs would contaminate all the food. To have more of an effect, 1/5th of the food needs to survive.</span></p><p><span style="">This place was a prison on the island.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guards rotated weekly and stayed in the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Absurd things like a drug farm could be done because it was such a closed off space.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Everybody can endure it if they starve together, but who will eat the food? What will happen in a situation where someone is starving?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave an evil laugh as he appreciated his work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After tonight, 4/5ths of the ingredients here wouldn&#x2019;t be able to be eaten.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Brown Bear wants to fight the Yakuza... But everyone will be at war because of the food.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He quietly turned off the lights and left the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By tomorrow morning, everybody in the prison would realize the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">And...</span></p><p><span style="">A life and death battle would start the war.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
