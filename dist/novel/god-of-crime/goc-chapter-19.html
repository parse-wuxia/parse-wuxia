<p>Chapter 19 - Criminals</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk had two secrets.</span></p><p><span style="">One was that he had lived for 15 years longer than other people his age.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, those 15 years weren&#x2019;t exactly happy.</span></p><p><span style="">He was framed and went to jail.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He lived in fear of the death penalty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every day in prison seemed like hell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The memories of those times were still in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Seo Tae-hyuk now considered himself a &#x2018;high school student&#x2019;, rather than a &#x2018;death row inmate.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was good in some ways.</span></p><p><span style="">What if it wasn&#x2019;t just the previous memories that were still in his head, but the previous personality as well?&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it were so, he would be in a mental hospital, not a school.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Another secret of his was the fact that he could use his &#x2018;crime skills.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror to show his current skills.</span></p><p><span style="">He had currently acquired three crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Robbery, his first skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could steal the items of anyone that he bumped into.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had used affinity points to upgrade the skill, making it so that he could select which item to steal.</span></p><p><span style="">Voice Modulation, his second.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A skill that could perfectly imitate the voices of others.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Spying, his third, which he could use to see the abilities and titles of others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;These skills...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There weren&#x2019;t just crime skills in existence. As he could see from An Eun-young&#x2019;s example, there were other skills out there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That alone meant one thing - that the talents and abilities of individuals were shown in the form of skills.</span></p><p><span style="">If so, it was odd.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Why am I able to use crime skills?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He only had three at the moment, but he would be able to learn more in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">He was suspicious of his title.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked on the title in the Demon Revealing Mirror, and an explanation came up.</span></p><p><span style="">[God of Crime]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can make use of all criminal skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Somehow, it seemed like he could learn and use the skills of other criminals due to his title.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the ability was based on his rating. Currently, Tae-hyuk was a Commoner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the lowest rating, so there were various of restrictions.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed the new upgrade conditions.</span></p><p><span style="">[Create a blacklist, 1/1]</span></p><p>[Secured the people on the blacklist, 3/20]</p><p>[Make all stats over 50 points.]</p><p>If he cleared all three of these conditions, then he could raise his rating. He would be able to do more once he upgraded to a Noble.</p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew his future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he did nothing and sat idly, then the same reality that he previously experienced would be repeated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would be framed again and would go to jail for the second time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His sister Ha-ran and younger brother Tae-min would receive the same tragic ends.</span></p><p><span style="">However, if he changed the present, then the future would also change.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had caught one of the people on the blacklist, Yoo Cheol-ho, and saved the lives of three people.</span></p><p><span style="">It was clear that this could also be applied to himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then first of all, I need to upgrade my personal rating.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he had only secured three people on the blacklist.</span></p><p><span style="">However, hundreds of people still remained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among those on the list were terrorists who killed hundreds of people, as well as the leader of a pseudo-religion cult with thousands of believers.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Confronting them with his current set of skills was impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I need the ability to catch people on my blacklist. However, don&#x2019;t I need to catch people on the blacklist to get an upgrade? It is like employers not hiring inexperienced workers. This is just a painful regression!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to do what he could first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was still one upgrade condition apart from the blacklist, and that was to raise his stats above a certain threshold.</span></p><p><span style="">These were Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s current stats.</span></p><p><span style="">Stats: Stamina (63), Intelligence (14), Agility (24), Dexterity (31)</span></p><p><span style="">His stats were slightly different from when he first received the Spying skill.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, his stamina had decreased by one, while his agility had gone up by two, and his intelligence by 10.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His rise in intelligence was due to constantly studying with An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">By the way, it was strange that his stamina had decreased, while his agility had increased.</span></p><p><span style="">Why had such a thing occurred?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hum hum. I am an energetic high school student. It can&#x2019;t be helped!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, it had been a week since his suspension, and he had already studied and raised his intelligence by 10 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This increase rate wouldn&#x2019;t have been possible without An Eun-young&#x2019;s studying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he kept doing it at this rate, then he would be able to raise it to 50 points during his suspension period.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk, are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young came in holding a bag of ice.</span></p><p><span style="">At this moment, Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Come to think of it, he was currently alone in a room with a girl. </span><span style="">Of course, this wasn&#x2019;t his purpose, as he was here to study with An Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Still, he couldn&#x2019;t help being nervous.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just how much did you study? You suddenly got a nosebleed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the tissue blocking his nose and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, I don&#x2019;t think I got the nosebleed from that. The meal...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled the dinner that An Eun-young had prepared.</span></p><p><span style="">Turtle soup, grilled eel, fried pork liver, bokbunja juice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were energetic and were really good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eating such things had caused his blood to overflow.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s expression darkened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um... Do you not like the taste?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That isn&#x2019;t it. I-It is just a little much.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stamina is important for studying! I made these dishes because they are good for your stamina...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no! It is delicious!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-really? I&#x2019;m glad! How is your stamina? Isn&#x2019;t it going up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t seem to have a good effect on his stamina.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t tell the truth to An Eun-young who was smiling so innocently.</span></p><p><span style="">The ice pack was placed on his head to cool down his hot body.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young declared with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then, let&#x2019;s start learning!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young had taken off her uniform and was only wearing a thin dress. Now that the test had ended, her dark circles were almost gone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hidden innocent and cute appearance of hers was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;H-help me.&#x2019;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</p><p></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s private lesson ended at 10 p.m.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk exerted great patience and studied well until the end.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, since I am getting help from her studying skill...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">His other stats weren&#x2019;t rising this quickly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Intelligence had increased by 10 and his score on the mock test rose by nearly 20 points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He really might be able to reach the high rankings in the whole school in just a month.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;By the way, I never thought that Park Sung-kwang would actually drop out.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Today was the day that Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s disciplinary committee would be held.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously, the result would be similar to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Park Sung-kwang hadn&#x2019;t come to school since a week ago, and today he had suddenly dropped out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Well. He did trust in his father too much.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Seong-ho and his secretary, Lee Ki-hwan, were both criminals on the blacklist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was lucky that he could secure two people at once.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was a bitter taste in his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Ki-hwan was different from other criminals, as he only followed the orders of Park Seong-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the end result was still a crime. In the end, he acted according to his conscience.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the handcuffs, his face looked satisfied, because he no longer needed to get his hands dirty.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, it would have taken a few more years for Lee Ki-hwan to do this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His hands would have become even dirtier.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was able to finish matters before all of that even happened.</span></p><p><span style="">The series of events started with cheating, and ended with a politician and his secretary being arrested.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had watched the TV as Park Seong-ho and Lee Ki-hwan were handcuffed. He then received&#xA0;two affinity points.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He thought back to Yoo Cheol-ho, and recalled the two people killed by Lee Ki-hwan that were saved.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Currently I only caught three people? What about the hippo and the clown?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">They were people on the blacklist that he would meet soon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This wasn&#x2019;t a game, and the criminals didn&#x2019;t appear in order from weakest to strongest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is a chance I might meet the final boss at the beginning.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">There would be no way for him to deal with them with his current abilities.</span></p><p><span style="">His head hurt.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he had a colleague who he could share everything with...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Should I tell Kang-suk hyung?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head. Kang-suk had to be the guardian of Ha-ran and Tae-min, so Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t drag them into the middle of an incident.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is there anyone on the blacklist that I can cooperate with?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">No apparent name came to mind.</span></p><p><span style="">His mind was filled with complicated thoughts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk became lost in his thoughts as he walked the streets at night.</span></p><p><span style="">There were luxury homes around him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s house was one of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her father was the director of a general hospital. She was good at studying and lived well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her face was also cute when it wasn&#x2019;t covered in dark circles. Another bonus was that she cooked well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know who she will marry, but they must&#x2019;ve saved a country in their past life.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">At the end of the street, there was a two-storey house that seemed like it would appear in a drama.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;One day, I will move into a house like that.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">A smile formed on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face as he imagined his family living together in a two-storey house with a yard.</span></p><p><span style="">But then he saw something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Are they trying to climb over the wall because they lost their house key?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to quietly watch the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a woman who looked suspicious.&#xA0;</span>She was wearing leather clothes that clung to her body and had various tools.</p><p><span style="">There was something else that stood out, however.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t climb the fence and kept slipping down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every time it happened, she would kick the stones on the street.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She seemed strangely familiar.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Uh, isn&#x2019;t that the person from last time?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young had lost her spirit after being threatened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had seen the woman when he took An Eun-young home, and didn&#x2019;t think it was a big deal at the time. </span></p><p><span style="">When he thought about it again, he felt suspicious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t think she would lose her key twice. There seemed to be a different purpose.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... A thief?</span></p><p><span style="">Why else would she be standing in front of a rich home?</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the novice thief turned her head to look for another way.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like watching a toddler trying to climb a wall so he walked away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to get far away.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was past 10 o&#x2019;clock at night. </span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was surprised when he arrived home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The house was in a mess, as if a thief had gone through it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The closet and drawers were pulled open and all the contents emptied.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-min was attending a private cram school and wasn&#x2019;t back yet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran was sitting on the floor and crying alone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk... W-waaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like meeting the thief on his way home had foreshadowed the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="">First, he had to make sure that Ha-ran wasn&#x2019;t hurt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. Are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;U, eung...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran stammered as she explained the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">She had went out for a while and came back to this. The house was a mess.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed with relief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The most important thing was that Ha-ran hadn&#x2019;t been at home.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what did they steal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s house didn&#x2019;t have any valuables.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The money they had was used to pay back all the debts. It covered everything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The rest went into the furniture. </span></p><p><span style="">Most of this was due to the bounty received for catching Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was less profit to be gained compared to the effort to move the furniture.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, we still have all the furniture but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">All of the furniture was still here.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Ha-ran pointed to her treasure chest with a trembling hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Surely not my bankbook? Even if they steal it, they won&#x2019;t be able to withdraw anything.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">After the voice phishing incident, Tae-hyuk had set a password on his account and all the seals were kept separately.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Three family members were in charge of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They couldn&#x2019;t do anything with just one seal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M-Mother&#x2019;s keepsake is gone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk trembled as he heard Ha-ran&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the silver Rosario. It wasn&#x2019;t a cheap item.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was worth approximately 200,000 won?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an ornament that was difficult to determine the value because it was worn.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was the only remaining memento of his parents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how difficult life was, they couldn&#x2019;t sell it.</span></p><p><span style="">But alas, it was now stolen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how much it was worth, it was a precious memory that they couldn&#x2019;t live without.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">Perhaps the culprit wasn&#x2019;t listed on his blacklist. However, they had stolen something precious in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s family.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">He burned with fighting spirit as he thought of the thief.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. Don&#x2019;t worry, I&apos;ll surely find Rosario.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuheom. Sniffle!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed some tissues for the crying Ha-ran. Ha-ran sniffled and blew her nose.</span></p><p><span style="">From what Tae-hyuk remembered, Rosario had been safe for the entirety of those 15 years. However, it was now stolen.</span></p><p><span style="">The cause was Tae-hyuk moving to this house.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like a butterfly effect, since a thief wouldn&#x2019;t bother with a semi-basement rented room.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt a heavy sense of responsibility.</span></p><p><span style="">Changing the present changed the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it wasn&#x2019;t always in a good way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Let&#x2019;s start catching a thief.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
