<p><span style="">Chapter 109: Jail War #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">This newbie, what the hell did he want?</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he looked at the person before him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Until now, Shin Chang-ho just saw Kim Cheol-su as a weird newbie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he became a presence that couldn&#x2019;t be ignored as soon as the name Shin Seo-yeon emerged from his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the only family that Shin Chang-ho, an orphan, had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once Shin Chang-ho left the orphanage, he didn&#x2019;t get a job and roamed the back alleyways to play.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he was scouted by high-ranking members of Gallery who saw his unique strength and stamina, thus becoming a member.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And 10 years later, the person from the back alleyways became a chief in the huge organization.</span></p><p><span style="">But things had turned out strangely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to live like a human, but then he ended up going to jail instead of the boss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before entering the prison, Shin Chang-ho said to his sister,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just wait seven years.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then she replied with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ve already waited 10 years, seven more isn&#x2019;t too long.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Once I return, I will be a high-ranking official of the organization. Then let&#x2019;s get married.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho confessed his longing of 20 years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She waited for a moment before tearfully nodding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a little too late, but he had the confidence to make her happy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the next day, she didn&#x2019;t contact him after returning home.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, he thought she was just sorting out her mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she didn&#x2019;t contact him for a week.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho felt irritated and desperately wanted to find her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the only thing he could do was order his men outside to look for her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything would be over if he broke out now.</span></p><p><span style="">Time constantly passed by.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One month...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Half a year...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then three years.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t find her despite searching the whole country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had been waiting for Shin Chang-ho all her life, but now Shin Chang-ho was the one in the position of waiting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a saying that a person didn&#x2019;t realize how important something was until it was gone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho realized that it was true.</span></p><p><span style="">In a situation where he had halfway given up, her name emerged from the mouth of a newcomer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s fingertips started shaking, and he whispered in a small voice so that his bodyguards couldn&#x2019;t hear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...If you find her then I can give you my life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Brown Bear of Gallery has a pure love story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If it is a lie then it will be hard for you to stay here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I definitely know her whereabouts.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho made gestures for his bodyguards to withdraw.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he didn&#x2019;t 100% trust the other person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was desperate enough to grab a rotten line.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s hear the story in detail.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk opened his mouth after a pause that was long enough for rice to cook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sooner or later, a war will break out in here. I want to cooperate with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean? You will tell me where my sister is if we work together?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Of course, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that you will be my subordinate. You will be treated as an equal partner.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s lips twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...So what benefit can you get from this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just want you to do some simple things for me. There is someone I have a personal grudge against. There is information I won&#x2019;t be able to get by myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Personal grudge? Who is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Park Sung-yul.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho licked his lips. The name of a man he knew emerged from the mouth of the newbie.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That gloomy guy. What do you want from him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will tell you once we become a little closer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho groaned as he started to think, and his eyes narrowed in suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...You are hiding something. However, it is difficult to reject your proposal. If you confirm one thing, I will accept it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho had an unbelievable authoritative aura after being stuck in prison for three years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He slowly approached the other person and whispered in his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Prove that you aren&#x2019;t a spy planted by a cop, and I will listen to your proposal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled, pulled out a notebook and handed it to Shin Chang-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Read it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho accepted Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s notebook and started reading the contents without saying anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no need to.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho stared at the other person like he was spellbound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Something huge was written in the notebook.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know a lot that will help with the war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...A-Are the words written here true?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho couldn&#x2019;t believe his eyes. His voice was shaking with excitement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was natural that he reacted in such a way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The contents of the notebook were huge.</span></p><p><span style="">There was information on the businesses entering and leaving Blue Dragon Prison, the shift table with the working hours of the guards, and the route they took to get here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there were numerous secret documents about the Blue Dragon Prison filling the small notebook.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If this was known to be in the hands of criminals, some of the heads of the people in charge would fly away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You know that I am gathering information here. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t start just two weeks ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The notebook contained information that was collected inside and outside the dungeon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he was giving something this important to Shin Chang-ho?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just to help him stalk Park Sung-yul?</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I understand. I don&#x2019;t believe that you are a spy. But I want to ask what you are going to do with this? Are you planning an escape?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you. It is still a secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho slowly nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">The other person was bigger than he thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just before, Shin Chang-ho thought he was a spy planted by the police, but the chances of that being true was low, now that this information was given to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Chang-ho could do anything in Blue Dragon Prison is he had the information in the notebook.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be a tremendous help in the war against the Japanese inmates.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This much information, why are you giving it to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I gave you&#xA0;only 30%.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At the very least, there should&#x2019;ve been a relationship between us in the beginning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk just smiled instead of answering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Based on his memories, he would imprisoned here four years later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man in front of him should&#x2019;ve been released four years later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Nevertheless, Tae-hyuk knew Shin Chang-ho because he caused an incident and a few years were added to his sentence.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then for now, tell me how I can help you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho was Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mentor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk wouldn&#x2019;t have survived 10 years in this place if it wasn&#x2019;t for him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Shin Chang-ho like he was seeing a friend after a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-How great. Did you think of this all by yourself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho exclaimed with wide eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Cheol-su didn&#x2019;t just have information, his ability to plot and intimidate the enemy was enormous as well.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I learned everything from you. Brown Bear.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I boast the best connections in the prison, so this should be enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho said in a trembling voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was someone scouted by a high-ranking executive of Gallery.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But Newbie, if you get out then come work with me. If you join &#x2018;Gallery&#x2019; then you won&#x2019;t have a job anywhere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thanks for the offer, but I can&#x2019;t. I have already made an appointment with another place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had promised to go to university with An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho said with a dissatisfied expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the newbie entered the gang, then Gallery would get someone huge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Shin Chang-ho wasn&#x2019;t like the hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, who visited someone&#x2019;s home three times just to recruit them.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, there were many opportunities in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&apos;ll get started this evening.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please do so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Tae-hyuk left, Shin Chang-ho convened his loyal men and gave them a few simple commands.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s men was called a human copier.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used to make forged artwork out in society.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho gave some instructions to the human copier.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand Hyung-nim. I just need to go to Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s room and draw everything I see?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. In the evening, some kids will keep an eye on Park Sung-yul. During that time, you will look around Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s room.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will handle it. Please leave it to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The human copier nodded as he received Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s command.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">At dinner time, the cell doors opened and the prisoners headed to the dining room to eat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Sung-yul could feel someone&#x2019;s eyes on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why are people staring at me today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a person who didn&#x2019;t have any close friendships and stayed by himself reading books or writing things in his notebook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Is there something on my clothes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul never imagined that he would be the Brown Bear&#x2019;s target and started to eat at the place where he normally sat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a few oversized people came up to him with their plates.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is it okay to sit here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The big people were gangsters.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-yul looked at the people before him with a puzzled expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though the dining room didn&#x2019;t set them apart, there was a certain area for the gangsters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, the gangsters occupied the best place, but why were they sitting next to a serial killer like himself?</span></p><p><span style="">Something was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Park Sung-yul was alone and there were several people in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t politely refuse.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sit down.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Then three or four oversized people sat around Park Sung-yul.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed as though they were threatening him not to escape.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He calmly placed rice in his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Park Sung-yul enjoyed his meal, the human copier quietly entered his room as Shin Chang-ho ordered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, I shall start working.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The human copier searched Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s room and found a few sketchbooks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many images and poems that couldn&#x2019;t be identified.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have a lot of time, but he could make copies of more than half of the present items.</span></p><p><span style="">The human copier put all of Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s things in their original position with a satisfied expression and headed to Shin Chang-ho&#x2019;s room.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heheh, Hyung-nim. Here it is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After confirming the goods, Shin Chang-ho slowly nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You went through a lot of trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The human copier acted politely towards him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a few years, Shin Chang-ho would be a high-ranking official of Gallery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Acting like this wasn&#x2019;t a loss for him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is nothing. Please call me again if you need anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After the human copier left, Shin Chang-ho started to look in more detail.</span></p><p><span style="">There were some paintings that looked like the scribbles of elementary school students, as well as some mumblings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Why does the newcomer want these things?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Chang-ho never dreamt that they would be codes pointing to the places where Park Sung-yul had hidden the bodies of his victims.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had received the payment for this in advance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Sung-yul delivered the puzzles as promised to the newcomer.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you Brown Bear. There are people waiting for this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">That evening, the newcomer wrote a letter to someone.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
