<p><span style="">Chapter 30 - &#xA0;Ill-Fated Relationship from a Past Life</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk was back!</span></p><p><span style="">The news of the two notorious people, who were disciplined due to the cheating incident, heated up the school.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had received a one month suspension, while Park Sung-kwang dropped out of school as a result of the suspension.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-yuk&#x2019;s one month suspension was now over.</span></p><p><span style="">The school was noisy as the students spread the story.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, did you know that Seo Tae-hyuk was caught in Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s evil plots?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ack! That is scary. How can I even go to school tomorrow...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, you are both wrong. Isn&#x2019;t that statement more believable when applied to the gangster Seo Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, perhaps. I heard that he had an offer to join an organization after graduating...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-A gangster?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The rumours snowballed into something bigger and inconceivable.</span></p><p><span style="">The main party involved, Tae-hyuk, was in the library and not in the classroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was impressed by An Eun-young&#x2019;s effort.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eun-young, really, thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dark circles could be seen behind An Eun-young&#x2019;s thick glasses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had obviously spent the night trying to make this happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-It is nothing much... It is nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. I wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to do this well without you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk now had 47 intelligence points, the result of focusing solely on studying after he regained Rosario from Big Mama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No matter how hard he had tried, it could still be said that this really was a period of rapid growth.</span></p><p><span style="">What would have happened if he hadn&#x2019;t met An Eun-young?</span></p><p><span style="">His intelligence had &#xA0;climbed even faster than it had in the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="">The retest was in two hours.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the meantime, he had to memorize many things in preparation of the test.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;In my most recent test, I had an average of 90 points. If I memorize all of the things that Class President brought up then...&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">It might really be possible to get close to the first ranked in the school.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... T-then. This is the last study session. Try your best! Fighting!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young cheered with a raised fist.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, she looked so cute that Tae-hyuk felt his heart pounding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm hmm. Yes. Isn&#x2019;t it somewhat unsatisfactory that this is the last time? Then, please look after me well, Class President.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young pouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;C-Call me Eun-young.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at her with a bemused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, okay... E-Eun-young. Is this it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Thank you. Then, let&apos;s get started.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The student sessions of Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-young were ending.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Seo Tae-hyuk. Did you study a lot?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The student supervisor asked with a strangely irritated tone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed that he didn&#x2019;t like the fact that Park Sung-kwang dropped out while a problematic person remained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He got a bribe from Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s parents based on his graduation results. </span><span style="">One of his precious money sources had disappeared because of a gangster.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, there was hatred in the student advisor&#x2019;s eyes as he watched Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am a little busy. Just do it as usual.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cocky brat... Teacher Jung believes in you, but I am different. Frankly, it was hard to believe that you got that grade legitimately, so this retest is to make things certain. Do you have any objections?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If there are any doubts, then it has to become certain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, right. You haven&#x2019;t received any lessons for a month. The test range is the same as the last test. I told the teachers to pay special attention, so I think this will be a very interesting test.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Inside the classroom, there was only the student advisor and Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have decided to supervise all of your tests today. Do you know what will happen if I see your eyes looking around? Well, I don&#x2019;t think that someone who was first place in the school would do that. Hahahat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed his pens on the desk and prepared for the test.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the student advisor approached with gleaming eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let me take a look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The student advisor confirmed that Tae-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t hidden any cheat sheets in his desk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he carefully looked at the pens and clicked his tongue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a complete criminal treatment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh. Then, the first one is Korean Language. The time limit is 50 minutes. If you write even one word after the time limit is up, then you will get a zero.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. Then I will start.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk accepted the test paper with a very relaxed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Rather, it was the student advisor who cared.</span></p><p><span style="">He had received a bribe from Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s parents. It was a moderate sum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this fact was already noticed by Seo Tae-hyuk. He wanted to kick Seo Tae-hyuk out of school somehow.</span></p><p><span style="">In order to do that, everything hinged on this retest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The student advisor didn&#x2019;t know what method Seo Tae-hyuk would use to raise his grades. </span><span style="">However, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do anything as long as he was monitored closely. </span></p><p><span style="">The student advisor laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, this test was much more difficult than the last one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many traps, and the problems were completely different from the last test&#x2019;s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he only got 80 points this time, then the student advisor would be able to transfer him to another school.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk waited for the test with a bored face, like he didn&#x2019;t know what the student advisor was thinking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, let&#x2019;s start the test!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The student advisor announced the start of the test.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk once again admired An Eun-young&#x2019;s ability after seeing the test paper.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wah. Wasn&#x2019;t Class President right?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young predicted that this test would be a lot harder than the test a month ago.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the right answer.</span></p><p><span style="">The problems were at least a level greater in difficulty.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ah, don&#x2019;t I know this problem?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, almost all of them were already given out by An Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he knew all of the problems.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... As expected from the owner of the Studying skill.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started to solve the problems.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed as if he would be able to get a higher score than he thought.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">The tests were all finished.</span></p><p><span style="">The student advisor sat at his desk with a blank face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How did you do all of this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Skimming through the questions, he could see that most of the answers were correct.</span></p><p><span style="">The student advisor screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This test is invalid! Tell me! How the hell did you cheat?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stretched his neck that had grown stiff from sitting around all day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he looked at the student advisor and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were looking at me the whole time while I was testing. I didn&#x2019;t cheat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This bastard!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The agitated student advisor tried to hit Tae-hyuk with the baton that he was holding.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, the firmly closed door opened and Teacher Jung Nam-ho entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Seo Tae-hyuk! You better hope that you did well on the test! I came to score it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Jung Nam-ho greeted Tae-hyuk and then looked at the student advisor.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Student advisor-nim. You did a really good job. From now on, I will take care of the scoring.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The student advisor flopped down with a dumbfounded expression.</span></p><p><span style="">He repeatedly opened and closed his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait a minute. Isn&#x2019;t it unfair with Seo Tae-hyuk in here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled at Jung Nam-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will go out and wait.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He left the classroom and saw An Eun-young waiting with an anxious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">She had done everything she could. The only thing left was to wait like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk... The test?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a &#x2018;V&#x2019; sign with his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Waaaaahhhhh!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was as delighted, as if it were the fruits of her own labor.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Jjak!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The two people laughed and high-fived.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">The results of Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s test were released to the whole school the very next day.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant that he attracted everyone&#x2019;s attention.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That is ridiculous...!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The people who saw Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s results attached to the bulletin board were confused.</span></p><p><span style="">He had an average of 92 points, and had moved up to second ranked in the class.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was also seventh ranked in the school.</span></p><p><span style="">However, other students didn&#x2019;t realize that Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s test was more difficult than usual due to the student advisor.</span></p><p><span style="">Nevertheless, it really was an excellent grade.</span></p><p><span style="">The students at the front of the bulletin board left, and Seo Tae-hyuk and An Eun-young approached to check the score.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a surprised expression.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young spontaneous asked a question, as if she suddenly had a thought.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If this test was at the same difficulty as the other one... what rank would you be?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk answered confidently.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First.&quot;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">There was an uproar once it was announced that Seo Tae-hyuk was really a model student.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Seo Tae-hyuk really was a good student...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Besides, to achieve a rank of seventh in the school...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then Tae-hyuk is good at studying, and his face is also pretty good... Does he not have a girlfriend?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm, he is only being friendly with An Eun-young. They aren&#x2019;t in a relationship.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then I can confess? Next year is our third year, so this winter is my last chance at love!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The girls who stayed in the classroom talked and exclaimed joyfully.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, there were quite a few people attracted to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s poor appearance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, their eyes didn&#x2019;t dare to actively gaze at him.</span></p><p><span style="">It turned out that while his appearance that looked villainous,he was actually good at studying?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was like the protagonist of a romance novel! </span></p><p><span style="">As soon as class ended, Seo Tae-hyuk headed home.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young remained in the classroom due to her position of class president, and could hear the girls talking.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s evaluation had changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was obviously a situation worthy of congratulations.</span></p><p><span style="">Then why was she in a bad mood?</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young remembered the treatment that Tae-hyuk had received up until yesterday.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was the only one who knew that he wasn&#x2019;t bad at all, unlike the rumours.</span></p><p><span style="">However, his test results were good, and this seemed to change his status.</span></p><p><span style="">She felt strangely lonely.</span></p><p><span style="">In the classroom, the girls were arguing about who was going to first make contact with Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment that An Eun-young rose from her seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She walked over to the female students and said loudly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t be mistaken. Seo Tae-hyuk doesn&#x2019;t have time for a relationship with any of you, as he has decided to go to university with me.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone in the room fell silent at An Eun-young&#x2019;s declaration.</span></p><p><span style="">It sounded like a declaration of war saying that they shouldn&#x2019;t touch her property. </span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">The day that Tae-hyuk received the remaining balance from Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk was dressed in a slightly different style than usual.</span></p><p><span style="">Today was the day that he had to go to school, something he hadn&#x2019;t done in a long time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, Tae-hyuk was still wearing his uniform.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to go into the back alleys so...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he decided to buy clothes from a store that mainly sold vintage styles.</span></p><p><span style="">He asked the clerk to give him a recommendation and changed in the store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Viewed separately, they weren&apos;t strange clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shook as he saw his reflection in the mirror. </span><span style="">He wore skinny jeans with a black leather jacket. </span><span style="">Adding the shoes to the outfit really made him look like a biker.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What the hell is this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he bought it at such a low price that he couldn&#x2019;t get a refund.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, it was style that fit in naturally with the back alleys.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, Hyung! Are you new?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A bearded man in his thirties raised a hand in greeting as he passed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes. I have some business with Mama.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, yes. You should work hard when young. Then, do your best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man seemed to mistake Tae-hyuk as a business partner.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed again.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he had four crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, he became a model student with An Eun-young&#x2019;s help.</span></p><p><span style="">Would a new future unfold before him? One that was different from the past?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was a time I would think so...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was still too early to be relieved, as there were still too many problems that had to be addressed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First of all, Park Jung-hwan.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a politician of the opposing party.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The current president was pursuing a chaebol-oriented policy. </span><span style="">Park Jung-hwan often showed strong criticism towards this, and received wide support from the younger generation.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, he didn&#x2019;t have the right forces, but three years later, he reappeared like a comet, this time as part of the opposition. </span><span style="">He was popular enough to be considered as one of the next presidential election candidates.</span></p><p><span style="">However, five years later. He was attacked by someone and found dead.</span></p><p><span style="">All of the media paid attention to the person who killed him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The one who killed Park Jung-hwan was a young man in his 20s.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My fingerprints were found at the crime scene. I was seen killing Park Jung-hwan on CCTV. There were also five more witnesses. Additionally, once Park Jung-hwan&#x2019;s murder weapon was found... Of course, there were only my fingerprints on it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Jung-hwan was a representative of the anti-chaebol union, and a hero for the people in their 20s and 30s. There were many people without numerous interests invested in the country who hated him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was a regular youth who killed him...</span></p><p><span style="">It was a really ironic situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The entire country erupted.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled his memories of that time.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
