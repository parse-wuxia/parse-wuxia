<p><span style="">Chapter 137 - Everybody Gather! #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aaaaack! T-T-Taste this e-electricity!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2015;Bullet Time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun aimed the taser gun with trembling hands and pulled the trigger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two electrodes were launched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The electricity was set at the limit to neutralize the opponent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a </span><i><span style="">pajijik </span></i><span style="">sound as the electrodes flew through the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk easily avoided the taser gun fired by Kim Byung-gun.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-W-What, what the hell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The taser gun used a cartridge of compressed nitrogen to fire the electrodes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although the range was short, the speed definitely wasn&#x2019;t slow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible to see the shot and then avoid it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he did so effortlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Turn off. I have to save my daily minute. Then shall I start this game?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved his left hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he triggered one of the attributes of Illegal Surgery to block pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a skill that amplified the micro electricity flowing through the body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The nerves would be paralyzed for a while so that he wouldn&#x2019;t feel any pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a very good match with Illegal Surgery.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he brought the No.20 scalpel to his belly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have the holder so he had to press down on the blade with his fingertips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such sophisticated work would&#x2019;ve been impossible without the help of his crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">As he cut under his belly button, the contents inside started to be revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ack, aaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s see. Was it here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk rummaged through his stomach and started to pull things out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He definitely put a silicon pack inside&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Ah, found it!&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t die from whatever he did using Illegal Surgery, then he could restore it through Cancel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he acted like his body was a cadaver for dissection.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, touching his insides with his fingers was never pleasant.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun&#x2019;s eyes were huge as he watched the scene in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His entire body trembled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a grotesque scene from a horror movie.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the silicon pack that he put in his stomach.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was drenched in blood but the contents were fine.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I haven&#x2019;t eaten anything since yesterday due to this. But surprisingly, I&#x2019;m not that hungry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuaaack!&#x201D; M-Monster!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Inside was a Glock 17 and a spare mag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the gun and bullets as he muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You like to play pretend army. Now I am holding a gun. Do you want to play?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;G-Go away! Argggghhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun completely panicked and fell down as he tried to retreat backwards.</span></p><p><span style="">N-N-Noooooo!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he kept calm and reloaded the taser gun then it wasn&#x2019;t impossible to attack.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk combined the pistol with the magazine and loaded the bullets.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ching.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The sight of a man who cut open his stomach and was approaching with a gun was literally horrifying.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a weapon that was taken out of his own stomach.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Come, let&#x2019;s play once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tears flowed from Kim Byung-gun&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His whole body trembled as he stared at the weapon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly moved towards the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shall I see what the lunch menu was today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eeeeeeeok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kim Byung-gun dropped the taser gun to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he started to move.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Kim Byung-gun took one step back, the zombie with the gun took two steps forward.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once Kim Byung-gun was inevitably blocked by a wall, he started to scream as if he was dying.</span></p><p><span style="">There were guards passing by outside the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surely one of them would come rescue him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But unlike his predictions, the guards outside didn&#x2019;t come to his rescue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They just thought that Kim Byung-gun&#x2019;s punishment was a little harsher than usual.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-P-Person...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk arrived at Kim Byung-gun&#x2019;s side and aimed the gun at the other person&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he used even a little bit of strength then it would turn into a pool of blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ackkkk...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Byung-gun fainted as he thought the sound effect from Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s moth was real gunfire.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. Shall I borrow this face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid the gun and canceled Illegal Surgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then it was like time reversed as all the blood and substances on the floor returned to his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Next, the stomach that was visible to the naked eye disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It only took five seconds to repair his belly.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s vision clouded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he had opened his belly too large and had put a large strain on his body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...This is the limit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Using the pain blocker didn&#x2019;t just mean that he wouldn&#x2019;t feel any pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that he wouldn&#x2019;t notice if the body&#x2019;s condition was worsening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the future, he had to be careful when doing such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid Kim Byung-gun in a corner of the warehouse and turned into him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Byung-gun was quite muscular but there was a superficial similarity when covered by clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had to be careful when taking off his clothes and showering.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk exited the warehouse and pretended to know the other guard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kim Byung-gun sunbae. Did you properly punish the rookie today? He screamed like he was dying.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I need to do this sometimes or else he won&#x2019;t listen to me well. You should also be careful. The rumors these days aren&#x2019;t very good.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh. U-Understood. By the way, the rookie?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is still blubbering in the warehouse. Don&#x2019;t pull him out needlessly. Maybe it is better if he is stuck in there for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! U-Understood.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had fed him a sleeping pill, so he should be out for at least half a day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had verified the efficiency using Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he didn&#x2019;t forget the security card that Kim Byung-gun had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was now free to roam around the interior of the prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then shall I gather everyone together?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho scratched his ears and murmured,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Who is talking about me? Why do my ears tickle? Fuck, why do I need to wash poop-stained underwear here? If I had escaped Blue Dragon Prison as planned, then I would be sticking a knife in that cocky detective right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he was in Blue Dragon Prison, he had strangely slept all day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By the time he woke up, the prison was crushed and he was being moved to Red Phoenix.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the tunnel that he dug for nearly six months was useless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you think I will give up just from that? I&#x2019;m Yoo Cheol-ho! I will also escape from here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho muttered as he loaded dozens of prisoner uniforms into the washing machine.</span></p><p><span style="">A new escape plan was created in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Red Phoenix had one distinctive feature compared to the other three prisons.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The medical facility was much worse than the other prisons.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, the special ward for mentally ill patients is operated by another prison on land.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was what Yoo Cheol-ho was aiming for.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted to be the first person to escape from Blue Dragon Prison. If I am in a hurry then can&#x2019;t I pretend to be crazy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Yoo Cheol-ho noticed a familiar person who was working alone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a middle-aged man wearing thick rimmed glasses.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I forgot about him. I was supposed to watch him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The reason why Yoo Cheol-ho was in a rotten place like this was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made some type of deal with the warden of Red Phoenix.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As he was always preparing to escape from prison, he acted quietly, which caused him to be treated well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what that person did in society that caused him to be imprisoned. Am I just supposed to watch and report if he does anything unusual? I&#x2019;m lucky that I can be rewarded for doing such a simple job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho finished doing the laundry and started to watch Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">Then something strange happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of the guards with a dirty and bad personality called Kim Tae-sung over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was he trying to make Kim Tae-sung run an errand?&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he couldn&#x2019;t ignore the smell that something was going on.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho quietly followed Kim Tae-sung.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk became Kim Byung-gun and called Kim Tae-sung behind the laundry.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung asked with a suspicious expression,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you have something for me to do? I&#x2019;m sorry, but I still have things to do, so can you tell me right away? If I don&#x2019;t wash all the clothes before lunch then they won&#x2019;t be dry until tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a task. I came to keep the promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What do you mean...?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had made a promise with Kim Tae-sung in Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would break Kim Tae-sung out of prison and help him get revenge, in exchange for being provided with bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It has been more than a fortnight since then but had he already forgotten?</span></p><p><span style="">It was because Kim Tae-sung wasn&#x2019;t expecting it at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Feeling hope would just lead to despair.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you remember this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned his face sideways.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Heok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the face of the criminal Kim Cheol-su, not Kim Byung-gun.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;ve return to the original appearance for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk changed back into Kim Byung-gun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-Are you P-Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you wondering what I want from you?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...T-That.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is simple. It is because I need the bombs that you can make.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, he had no idea who caught him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was attacked by someone wearing a leather jacket but couldn&#x2019;t remember the face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he gained consciousness, he was handcuffed by the police.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the seasons changed while in prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Quite incidentally, he heard a conversation between two guards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber being sent to jail was the work of Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">As Kim Tae-sung was locked in thought, Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The Bomber is the only person who met both Seo Tae-hyuk and Phantom.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had caught Kim Tae-sung before he became a Noble.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that time, he couldn&#x2019;t change his face with &#x2018;Disguise&#x2019;, or hide his identity with the opera mask.</span></p><p><span style="">After meeting with Kim Tae-sung and confirming that he was indeed the Bomber, Tae-hyuk knocked him out with the iron pipe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What if he remembered Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s existence?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Something had to be done.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk confirmed Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s psychological state with Hawk Eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;He doesn&#x2019;t remember my face. However, he knows that he was caught by Phantom. Did he hear it from someone?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Due to the Hawk Eyes attribute, he had a great advantage in psychological warfare.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then you will help me escape?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. That is why I came. I&#x2019;ve secured the escape route and hideout. But...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shifted his gaze to a corner that wasn&#x2019;t visible from his position.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Kim Tae-sung. Someone was following you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was someone there.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
