<p><span style="">Chapter 132 - Traces of the Mask #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk brought Caterina and Semon to the previous cafe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In other words, they were entering enemy territory.</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as she saw the &#x2018;cafe893&#x2019; sign. (TL: The name is deliberately written in lower capitals by author)</span></p><p><span style="">Semon looked around suspiciously, like he expected an ambush.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Both of them were suspicious.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Yakuza are behind this shop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he watched the uneasy Caterina.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why, do you think I would sell you out? Well, doesn&#x2019;t this seem surprisingly good? Won&#x2019;t they give me one of the executive positions if I hand over the head of the Red Mafia?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You know...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina stretched out a hand to stop the agitated Semon from pulling out a gun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Semon. If Phantom was really planning that, then he wouldn&#x2019;t have spoken it out loud. Rather, that type of suggestion makes the story easier. I can promise you three times what the Yakuza offered.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed and looked at Caterina.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then I will listen to your story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina laughed and raised a finger.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please look at my face now...hmm. Do you think I am just a pretty face? Actually, Semon is the real boss behind me. So please don&#x2019;t talk that way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina&#x2019;s words were surprising.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had been suspicious when Caterina had introduced herself as the boss of the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At this moment, he realized that he took her lightly.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;She definitely isn&#x2019;t a normal girl.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time he lost a psychological battle against someone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t worry about being wiretapped. I removed all the surveillance cameras and recorders that were installed inside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s talk more over a cup of coffee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they opened the door, the cafe boss was mumbling something while he was counting money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It looked like he was thinking of escaping from debtors.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck~ I lost revenue due to that Phantom bastard closing my store.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey, it has been a while. I thought this place would be full of customers, but it&#x2019;s already closed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough! Y-You...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and summon an iron pipe using his Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he swung it at the boss&#x2019; head.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kaaang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The cafe boss fell to the ground with a large sound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk put the iron pipe down and clapped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now that the witness is handled, we can talk as much as we want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where did you suddenly get the iron pipe from? Are you a magician?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, this? Trade secrets. Then sit back and wait. Do you want any coffee?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he made coffee for three people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo... If I knew this was the case, then I would&#x2019;ve let him make the coffee before hitting him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they drank the coffee that Phantom made, the three people started to talk in earnest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Caterina stirred the surface that looked like a brownie with a fork and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I should explain my situation. As you can see, I&apos;m a woman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you don&#x2019;t have to explain that part.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A woman can&#x2019;t become the boss of the mafia.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you say you were the boss earlier?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is the problem.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina was the only child of the Ivankov family&#x2019;s boss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew that if he died, there would be a battle over who would be the boss.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Before my father died, he declared to all the members that he would leave everything to his only child. My father was literally the symbol of Zvezda. If I was a man, then I would&#x2019;ve been able to take over the Red Mafia without any problem. Even if they didn&#x2019;t swear absolute loyalty to me like they did to my father, they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to rebel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with an understanding expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Caterina&apos;s situation is similar to the King of Russia.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Red Mafia, Zvezda is a coalition of various organizations across Russia. Of course, there are eight bosses. I can&#x2019;t stop them all by myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, you will die in the fight against them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The end of the Red Mafia that Tae-hyuk remembered wasn&#x2019;t so different.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of the nine heads, there is only one who follows me. In such a situation, I can only do one thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked into Caterina&#x2019;s eyes as she told the story.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was speaking a shameful story.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were words that couldn&#x2019;t be said in front of her subordinates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was the situation so desperate that she was telling him this?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In other words, you have to prove that you have the ability to be the Red Mafia&#x2019;s boss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk suddenly had an epiphany.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia had done something in South Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um, by the way. Was it the Reubens business?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia had distributed forged artwork through South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had completely ruined their plans.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Surely it was the work of the woman in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina gazed at his opera mask with a red face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu, I didn&#x2019;t do that due to some malice. It was just a few fakes...&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then the damage sustained...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina was unable to bear it and raised her hand to her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ugh. I didn&#x2019;t come to talk about that business, so let&#x2019;s stop talking about it. After analyzing the past events, I realized that you aren&#x2019;t someone who would help a female in difficulty. You only move due to what interests you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am like that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doesn&#x2019;t that mean if the conditions are right, we can cooperate with each other? I have some bad memories but I&#x2019;ll forget about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, Tae-hyuk had inflicted one-sided damage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hrmm... The Red Mafia&#x2019;s boss is rendered helpless.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She came to see him directly so it wasn&#x2019;t a simple lie.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So you want my help for Caterina to be recognized as the Red Mafia&#x2019;s boss?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please, call me Anne. I don&#x2019;t like that name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you like.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are many who covet your abilities. Japan&#x2019;s Yakuza, The Triads in China, and the violent organizations in South Korea as well. The name of Phantom is more widespread among the mafia than you think.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So what do you want me to do? Don&#x2019;t tell me that you are planning to sacrifice the other bosses? I think it would be quicker to ask the guy standing over there. The merchant of death, Semon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon coughed as his name was called.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he didn&#x2019;t come forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t that simple. Even if I cut off the hydra&#x2019;s heads, new ones will just grow in their place. However, there isn&#x2019;t enough budget to do a new business. The only thing left for me is South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;South Korea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That is where I need your help, Phantom. You are in a conflict with the Yakuza. Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Triads as well. Don&#x2019;t you think they are too big to fight alone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It made a lot of sense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to touch the Triad unless they acted first.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the Yakuza were different. He needed to fight them in order to obtain Yamashita&#x2019;s gold and smash Mister Park.</span></p><p><span style="">Anne accepted it as a positive answer when Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t reply.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Semon and I will be your allies. You don&#x2019;t need to do anything for us. Just continue fighting with the Yakuza and the Triads. Then I will be able to build nests in South Korea without them interfering.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Anne, after gaining South Korea, would be recognized as the boss of the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom would be used as a barrier to block the Yakuza and Triads.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In other words, do you mean a non-aggression treaty? That seems to only be lucrative to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If necessary, I will support you with firearms and troops. And once the whole thing is over, I&#x2019;ll make you the 10th head of hydra if you want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, he would be the boss of the South Korean branches.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Obviously, if he entered into an alliance, then he would gain the power to fight both the Yakuza and Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he needed to keep in mind that the condition for upgrading to a King was to conquer the mafia game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Could he become a King if he allied with the Red Mafia to deal with the other two?</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk hesitated, Anne opened her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If that isn&#x2019;t enough, there is one thing left that I can give you. With me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, Anne didn&#x2019;t finish her words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror within Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s clothes started vibrating violently.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Biiiiiik-!</span></i></p><p><span style="">A warning cry rang in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">[Caution!]</span></p><p><span style="">-The Spying skill has detected a danger.</span></p><p><span style="">-The special ability has been triggered and 20 affinity points have been reduced.</span></p><p><span style="">-Time remaining until the raid on cafe893.</span></p><p><span style="">-00:01:49&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk trembled as he saw the message in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the special feature of Spying that detected the collapse of Atlantis.</span></p><p><span style="">This meant...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What is it? A-All of a sudden, a large sound...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon shrugged like he didn&#x2019;t know what Anne was talking about.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Lady. I&#x2019;m sorry, but I heard no sound.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You didn&#x2019;t hear that sound just now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no time to watch the argument.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, the countdown to the attack was steadily decreasing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, it wasn&apos;t at the level of the bomb exploding in Atlantis.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk reached towards Semon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gun.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What do you mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have no time to explain now. We are about to be attacked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nobody knows we are here... D-Don&#x2019;t tell me the Yakuza...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk raised a finger to his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he used Spying to see how many people were approaching.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are around 30 armed gunmen with assault rifles.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is fortunate that I have a weapon, but fighting alone against 30 people...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If Semon fought against 30 people, then his body would be riddled with holes like a honeycomb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anne approached the window and looked out using her hand mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she murmured in a despairing voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-We are completely surrounded...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Her eyes gazed at one of the attackers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t wearing a mask so she could see his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were the Yakuza.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...The Red Mafia. Maybe one of them didn&#x2019;t want me to be recognized as boss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon moaned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wonder how they knew we were here. Certainly not just anyone...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The whole reason she came alone without bodyguards was for security reasons.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But how did this place...?</span></p><p><span style="">While Anne was confused, the man in the opera mask approached.</span></p><p><span style="">He smiled and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Can I ask you something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Are any of your people out there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N-No!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then it doesn&#x2019;t matter if I get rid of them all?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the first time Anne realized the imposing nature of the man in front of her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to stand against the mafia alone.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
