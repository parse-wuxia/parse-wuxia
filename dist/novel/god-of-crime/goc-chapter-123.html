<p><span style="">Chapter 123 - Swallow the Sun #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Shatter the Sun Cult.</span></p><p><span style="">At first glance, it seemed simple to handle them using the Bomber or the Phantom&#x2019;s abilities.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, unlike all the previous cases, this wasn&#x2019;t a problem that would end so simply.</span></p><p><span style="">Would it end just by blowing up the base of the Sun Cult with a bomb?&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would simply move elsewhere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew of the crimes committed by the leader, but plenty of people went to jail instead of him.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he couldn&#x2019;t use his previous methods to get rid of Sun.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First, I should classify the chess pieces that are available right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He needed to use everything he had to fight the Sun Cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If possible, he wanted to avoid working as Seo Tae-hyuk as much as possible, but there was a limit to Phantom&#x2019;s network.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk opened a desk drawer and pulled out an old chessboard that he used to play with.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After unfolding it, he placed the black king in the middle.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is me, Seo Tae-hyuk. My identity absolutely can&#x2019;t be revealed, so it is something to be unconditionally defended.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Next was the queen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the strongest piece that he could move freely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The loss of the queen would play a huge part in the king&#x2019;s resignation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Both ends of the chessboard were for the rooks.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then Big Mama and Moonlight Flower.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were chess pieces made before he started acting as Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he met them, he had to hide that he was associated with Phantom as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&apos;s intelligence network.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s hacking and stealing skills were necessary to deal with the Sun Cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk held a bishop and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t like it but the bishops will be Shin Se-ho and the Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were difficult to use, but had the ability to reverse the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The pawns were the members of Nuclear Bomb that could be freely mobilized with money.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, there were the knights.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed the knights on an empty space and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is Detective Cho Kang-suk and Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">They had the authority to investigate and arrest the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to meet the rooks and pawns as Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would meet the knights and bishops as Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">He imprinted this firmly in his mind and reached out towards the white king, who could be called the enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, let&#x2019;s go slay the king.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have been promoted. Why are you still eating noodles?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk heard a familiar voice as he was organizing the investigation headquarters.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was his junior, who was smirking while eating spoonfuls of butter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is a busy day. Have you come to help me clean up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho placed an ice coffee in front of Kang-suk and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oho, avoiding the answer means that something is going on. The suspect will answer the investigator.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk thought about what happened yesterday and cleared his throat a few times.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Actually, I proposed to Seo Ha-ran.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! You finally made a decision! Congratulations Sunbae! Aren&#x2019;t you moving at the speed of light?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow! A ring that I never thought I would see on Sunbae&#x2019;s finger! It is somewhat modest, but made of platinum, a symbol of unchanging love! Judge, this is definitely an engagement ring!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t help laughing as Hyun-ho made a fuss.</span></p><p><span style="">Who would have ever thought that he was an investigator from Russia&#x2019;s Federal Security Service?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he had returned to Korea after half a year of working there, stating that it didn&#x2019;t fit him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he was considered one of the top three investigators in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho was delighted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So when is the wedding?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think May would be perfect. I want to give Ha-ran the happiest day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, the inspector will be glad...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The inspector?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When I saw him, Inspector-nim was worried about when Sunbae would finally get married, so I asked him what he would do if it happened. He said that he would bow deeply to the bride. I just want to see that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk felt dizzy at the thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such a bet was going on without him realizing it?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then why?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t hate it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm, so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;ll sing the congratulatory song.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s okay, you can just emcee.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Kang-suk desperately waved his hands in rejection, Hyun-ho looked at Kang-sk with wide eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kang-suk doesn&#x2019;t want Phantom to emcee?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why would he be interested in emceeing my wedding?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are best friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What? Who would want Phantom as the emcee of his wedding?</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked at Hyun-ho with a perplexed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I don&#x2019;t want the special troops as guests for the wedding.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu. Won&#x2019;t it be spectacular?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho took off his trench coat and placed it on a coat hanger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he sat in his chair and started to whisk the whipped cream in his coffee with a strange face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since then, have you been in contact with Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. No? He just took the money. He is strangely quiet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then, does Sunbae know a way to contact Phantom separately?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. There is no way to contact him first. It&#x2019;s a burner phone. The number is changed every time, and the one time I tracked the location, he appeared to be in Sichuan China.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Despite the interest of the police commissioner, Phantom&#x2019;s identity was still veiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is like 007. But if you have a chance to meet Phantom again, will you take me with you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk narrowed his eyes at the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho had started to show a large interest in Phantom not long ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It might not be for a big purpose.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he wanted to play a game against Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a strange feeling in his mind, but he couldn&#x2019;t say what it was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t help laughing at the thought.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom was someone that even people from other sides of the earth were interested in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was no wonder that Hyun-ho was interested in him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want to embarrass yourself like last time you met Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aish, surely not. At any rate, you said you recorded it the last time Phantom contacted you. Can you send it to me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I already sent it to the main office. Can&#x2019;t you go and look directly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I wanted to listen while writing a few reports. Well, it doesn&#x2019;t contain anything important. In addition, an investigator like me will be bombarded with things to do if I go to the main office.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was always a desire to ask his opinion on new cases.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he wasn&#x2019;t in a position to refuse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, the work would steadily accumulate.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked at him with a sympathetic expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are also suffering a lot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, that was the trouble with being too talented.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Not much had changed about Big Mama&#x2019;s pawn shop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately built up trust by trading her forged artwork that was worth several million won at a time.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two types of criminals that stolen goods brokers dealt with: Those who were lucky enough to get lucky and sell many goods, and those who would bring in a small, but consistent profit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was the latter that stolen goods brokers wanted to trade with for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo, did Tae-hyuk come?</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama smiled as she checked the door and rose from her seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were no other customers inside the pawn shop.</span></p><p><span style="">When they first met, Tae-hyuk had felt a prickling on his skin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, after some steady trading, her voice was soft, like they were old partners.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I won&#x2019;t be selling anything today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know the group &#x2018;Sun&#x2019;, active in Z City?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um, that is an emerging religion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama narrowed her eyes and said some neutral words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t know what he had to do with that place, so she refrained from any negative vocabulary.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and revealed his relationship with Sun in one word.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. That cult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. You know. Do you need information about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The more information there is, the better. I also want to know some family members who have gone missing due to the cult.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This seems quite lucrative.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard that they have some of Gauguin&#x2019;s oil paintings there.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama&#x2019;s eyes changed.</span></p><p><span style="">Paul Gauguin was a French painter that was the representative of post-impressionism.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He left numerous oil paintings behind that were traded at a price of over 100 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t know that they had such a classy hobby.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right. Once I get the goods, I will make a deal with Big Mama. Can&#x2019;t we profit from each other?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama looked down slightly and laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... I welcome such a good deal. By the way, can you do it by yourself? If necessary, I can introduce other experts to you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll ask you at a later time if I need it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big mama wrote message on her tablet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait two days for the information. And the price will be this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She showed Tae-hyuk the number she had written on the tablet screen.</span></p><p><span style="">10 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the past, it would be 20 million won. Is this a regulars discount?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I hope for your support in the future and will be giving you a special service. And even if you don&#x2019;t have any work, you can always come by to play. I will make you delicious tea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough... Maybe after this is over. Then this is a deposit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk handed over a bundle of 50,000 won bills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, the information deal with Big Mama ended without any problems.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he bargained a big more, then he would&#x2019;ve received free information on the condition that he turn over Paul Gauguin&#x2019;s paintings.</span></p><p><span style="">However, this deal with Big Mama was just right, since he might get damaged if he went too far.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to always keep an eye on the other person.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t forget that fact.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Sun&#x2019;s nest was on the outskirts of Z City in Gyeonggi Province.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They purchased a ruined university and built their own kingdom on that vast site.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was sitting in a cafe and drinking coffee while reading the information that Big Mama gave him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How much did he read?</span></p><p><span style="">He stood up and cried out,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, this is too much for half-price information!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Indeed, there was no free discount in this world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The amount was only 1/3 of the other information he bought.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This lady...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, he had expected it to some extent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sun was a strictly closed off religious group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Finding out information about such a place would be difficult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The amount was small, but it was better than nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">Apart from the owner sitting at the counter and looking at a photo book, no other person could be seen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the cafe owner and asked slowly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but can I ask for a refill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cafe owner stood up with an embarrassed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aigoo, that&#x2019;s right. I was lost in thought for a moment. I will come straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This cafe has a good atmosphere. But there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be too many customers...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha... Is that so? In fact, when the store first opened, many people came from the nearby university. However, it eventually closed down and people left for the Seoul campus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It must&#x2019;ve been hard for Boss-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Still, there are occasional customers from nearby factories. By the way, did you come here for a business trip?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had transformed into a white-collar worker with the crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The misunderstanding was natural.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk lied easily,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Actually, my family member fell into some strange group. I came to meet someone from the Internet to come up with some countermeasures.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, it is like that. Hu... There really are things like cults in this country...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk avoided the gaze of the cafe owner and confirmed the location of the hidden cameras installed in the shop.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I didn&#x2019;t say anything and he is already talking about a cult. Isn&#x2019;t this too amateurish?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was true that he came here to meet someone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk knew that this cafe was one of the traps created by Sun.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
