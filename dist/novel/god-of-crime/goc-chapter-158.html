<p><span style="">Chapter 158 - Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s Wish #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">His sister was waiting for him as he opened the front door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran waved her hands with a strange look.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, I just sent you a message, but you came so quickly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Message?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I wanted to buy clothes you clothes for my wedding. Didn&#x2019;t you come running after seeing it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">It was just before the wedding. Even though she was surely busy... Was his sister worried about his clothing now?&#xA0;</span><span style="">She seriously wanted to talk about this.</span></p><p><span style="">She had no one to help with the wedding plans, so she had to do everything herself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her dark circles reminded him of An Eun-young in her prime studying days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, she was beautiful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was like a flower that had just fully bloomed.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran had started studying at the Wolsang Institute not long ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wasn&#x2019;t even an intern yet, but her face was filled with hope.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m still a student so I can wear my uniform. So don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A small smile appeared on Ha-ran&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My Tae-hyuk is all grown up. I knew you would say that. But in this situation, I want to buy you some clothes as thanks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t you have to do more wedding invitations? It looks like there are a lot of pamphlets in the living room. It is hard to do alone, so shall I help you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course! This is important too! But first, shopping for Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s clothes! ...In fact, I feel really sorry that you are wearing the same clothes every day. Oh look at this!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Ha-ran pulled out a folded envelope from her pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She showed him the contents with a cheerful expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I saved this to buy Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s clothing. Let&#x2019;s find something stylish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">10,000 won bills were crammed inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were around 50 of them?</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk felt a lump in his throat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the meantime, he had hidden the fact that he made a huge amount of money from his crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He decided to reveal it after changing the future completely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could use the excuse of winning the lottery or receiving a blank inheritance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he used the crime skills then he could make a plausible lie.</span></p><p><span style="">Until then, he lived sparingly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In such a situation, Ha-ran had collected 500,000 won.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...This is obviously something she collected by living sparingly.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his dry lips and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Noona, if we were rich then what would you like to have?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You told me that you wanted to live in a two-story house with a garden while we were watching a drama. That is good. Or do you want something else? Or maybe a wish that you want to fulfill?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to confess the day before her wedding that he was rich by showing her the bankbooks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fight with Mister Park was over so the timing was good.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Ha-ran suddenly hugged Tae-hyuk with red eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My wish? Tae-hyuk. Noona only has one wish...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So that wish...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Why are you asking? I&#x2019;m embarrassed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I just want to hear it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran took a deep breath and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, my wish... It is to see you and Tae-min living well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Is that it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The end.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran closed her eyes and opened her mouth like it was time to confess something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mother and Father... they died in an accident... I was always anxious. I confidently said that I would be your parents instead... I always wondered if I was doing well...&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ttiring.</span></i></p><p><span style="">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, an image appeared in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A scene from his childhood that he had forgotten.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shook wildly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be...</span></p><p><span style="">Did that actually happened?</span></p><p><span style="">The scene on the Demon Revealing Mirror was of the accident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A truck carrying steel pipes slammed into a car after a sudden stop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person sitting in the driver&#x2019;s seat and the passenger seat died instantly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only the three children sitting in the backseat managed to survive.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a miracle since some of the steel pipes penetrated the car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A girl in a school uniform threw herself around two elementary school students.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a thick pipe in her stomach and blood was flowing down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite that, she smiled at her brothers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It&#x2019;s okay.</span></p><p><span style="">I will protect you, so rest assured&#x2014;.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ugh... W-What...?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva. Why was the scene so familiar?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he saw it directly in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">The facts overlapped in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran never went to the swimming pool after the death of their parents.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran whispered to Tae-hyuk,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want Tae-hyuk and Tae-min to live better lives than before... As if that accident never occurred...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Noona. I&#x2019;m sorry to say this all of a sudden. Can you show me your belly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran blushed and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is something I would like to check.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran was very embarrassed by his sudden request.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you remember that time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Maybe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran struggled for a moment in silence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. I understand. Instead, you must absolutely keep it a secret from Tae-min.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran carefully lifted the shirt she was wearing, exposing her belly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A smooth belly without any fat appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was a fierce scar on Ha-ran&#x2019;s lower abdomen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hehe... Ugly isn&apos;t it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was there.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Pajik.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">Pajijik.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized how much Ha-ran had sacrificed for her siblings.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She threw away her precious life to save her brother during the accident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How could he have ever forgotten such an important thing?</span></p><p><span style="">His head hurt.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the same time, his ears heard the sound of something breaking.</span></p><p><span style="">Ahh, yes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was alive because his sister saved him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? T-Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk literally ran towards the bathroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t stay any longer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tears constantly flowed from both eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Did Kang-suk know this fact?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t not know.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His sister didn&#x2019;t have the guts to hide such an important fact.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite that, they were getting married.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk really was a good person.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wanted to run up to Ha-ran right now and say.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry Noona.</span></p><p><span style="">And&#x2015;.</span></p><p><span style="">...Thank you.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Pajijijijijik</span></i><span style="">&#x2015;!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized that something on his face was shattering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He slowly raised his head and looked at the mirror in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was something really strange.</span></p><p><span style="">A blank face with no emotions stared back at him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then half of it broke and fell off of his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mask...?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...What, since when was I wearing this type of thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t understand the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk reached up and peeled off the half mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This...</span></p><p><span style="">The Phantom mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a shocked expression as the mask smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a voice was heard, like a hallucination.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Ah, I was discovered.</span></i></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Waaaack!</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk covered his mouth to block the scream that wanted to emerge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran was outside the bathroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to unnecessarily worry her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What is this?!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk tossed the mask to the ground and started stepping on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It turned into white particles and disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me that until now... Ugh...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he couldn&#x2019;t endure it and dunked his head over the sink.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t eaten anything, so only yellow gastric juices were vomited out, but it was better than nothing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a few minutes, he felt the nausea fading away.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s concerned voice could be heard from outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tae-hyuk? What&apos;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;All of a sudden, my stomach...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! Y-Your stomach hurts? I&#x2019;ll go and buy medicine straight away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I think it will get better if I rest a little bit. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made an excuse to Ha-ran and sat on the bathtub.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the illusion of people dying appeared in front of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I...killed... P-People... W-What on earth...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When did he start to cross the line?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and desperately searched through his memories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes. It is clearly after I upgraded to a King.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There were some signs of it when he was a Noble.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The more he used the crime skills, the more numb he became to committing crimes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he became another person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It became worse after he was a King, and he easily killed others.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he was spellbound by something, but the memories still remained intact.</span></p><p><span style="">A few hours ago, he was about to kill a couple who hadn&#x2019;t done anything wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This, dammit! I am just like a serial killer!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the future, he was framed and went to prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he might be punished for the sins he committed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But I have the crime skills... Waaaack! Y-Yes! That is the killer!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This really was a cursed object from the beginning!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had barely come back to his senses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what if he started using the crime skills again?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk bit his lip and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a criminal... So now I will quit being Phantom. I will return to being the high school student Seo Tae-hyuk, Ha-ran noona&#x2019;s little brother.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t throw away the Demon Revealing Mirror but he decided not to use the sinister crime skills.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Woong!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Woong woong!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Woong woong woong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror started to vibrate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Do you think I will be convinced by that? I&#x2019;m not going to use the crime skills. So just disappear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a message appeared on the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[It is possible to become the God of Crime by obtaining one million affinity points.]</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror showed him the condition required to upgrade his rank.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you saying that you want me to kill one million people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He obtained affinity points by changing the fate of others.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a simple way to do this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to kill someone who should&#x2019;ve lived.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn! I guess you laughed when I was possessed by you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt terrible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes. I won&#x2019;t use the crime skills. Then I&#x2019;ll be able to maintain my sanity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, the main case was over.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Woong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Woong woong!</span></i> <i><span style="">Woong woong woong!</span></i></p><p><span style="">As if trying to persuade him, the Demon Revealing Mirror kept on raising notification windows in front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You won&#x2019;t deceive me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk declared firmly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the future, it was necessary to protect his important people without using the crime skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was only one way to do that.</span></p><p><span style="">He left the bathroom and headed to the kitchen where Ha-ran was cooking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Yes? Oh, I&#x2019;m making porridge because your stomach hurts. Just wait a little longer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve picked a career.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;C-Career? Oh, the course you want to go into?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;m going to being a detective like Kang-suk hyung. I will go into the police department. There is a course at S University.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo! W-Wah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran grinned and clapped with delight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her brother wanted to be a police officer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a wonderful job where he would protect people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! Obviously, Kang-suk will support you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran gently hugged Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, this was surely right.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reason he chose a police officer was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk still remembered the future.</span><span style="">Most of the information was about crimes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As long as he had those memories, there was a possibility of being dragged into incidents.</span></p><p><span style="">Could he solve those without using the crime skills?&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, a police officer was different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could officially fight against crime.</span></p><p><span style="">As he thought this, his anxious mind calmed down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now there was nothing...</span></p><p><span style="">The next day, Ha-ran went missing.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
