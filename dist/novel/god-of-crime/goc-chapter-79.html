<p>Chapter 79 - Phantom Opens His Eyes #1</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">There was a somewhat unusual operating room in T Medical Center.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It could only be reached through a few tightly controlled areas, and even the cleaners working there were tightly controlled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was to prevent what was happening inside from being leaked anywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Two young men in work clothes were cleaning the operating room after the operation was done.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck, the artery was hit again. It&#x2019;s completely bloody in here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh... The blood isn&#x2019;t a joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even so, I would rather do this, since it&#x2019;s easy money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then one of them asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;By the way, Hyung-nim. I have a question.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is it? Ah, be careful there. If you fall then you will die. Your flesh will be cut off and sliced in pieces.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young man, who almost slipped, clicked his tongue and put the flesh into the bag.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why isn&#x2019;t anesthesia used? Rather than cutting off one limb to stop them from moving, it would be better to just inject them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The older one smirked at the youth&#x2019;s question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! If you care about that then you shouldn&#x2019;t work here. The reason is simple. It&#x2019;s just like how fish are kept alive for sashimi. Won&#x2019;t the medicine affect the organs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young man nodded with a face like he understood.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, the cleaning of the operation room is almost finished... Now it is just throwing away the trash.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Bring some hydrochloric acid and plastic from the warehouse. After the room is soaked for 3~4 hours, it can be used. Put the rest in the drum barrel. Ah, prepare two drums.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, one more is being done in the afternoon?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. This is a really good business.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since the organs from prisoners were banned in China, those who needed transplants now came to Korea for the surgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, it was safer than China which normally had side effects due to the unhygienic surgical environment.</span></p><p><span style="">Recently, the global market was heavily saturated with organs from India and Southeast Asia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The most expensive parts, such as the heart, liver and kidney, were traded for around 200 million won a piece.</span></p><p><span style="">However, T Medical Center had fresh organs that were checked by medical staff, making their prices were twice as high as international ones. </span><span style="">Despite this fact, people still waited in line for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;s roughly 1.5 billion per person? I would be happy to sell mine at such a high price. I would die happy. Huhuhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then the operating room door opened and Dr. J, a surgeon, entered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? It still isn&#x2019;t clean? I told you to finish it as quickly as possible, didn&#x2019;t you hear me? Why are you just standing around?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The older cleaner bowed his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I&#x2019;m really sorry. We will finish it as soon as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, yes. Make sure you handle it. Kim Soo-bin still has one arm left; however, the schedule is tight, so she has to be done soon. Make sure you tie her up so that she&#x2019;s unable to move.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;ll make sure she can&#x2019;t life even one finger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phew, I&#x2019;ll trust you this time...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. J sighed and exited.</span></p><p><span style="">The youth asked the older cleaner who was still bowing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is the doctor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, that is him. Remember the person in charge here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah... The atmosphere isn&#x2019;t a joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard he is one of the top three experts in China. Don&#x2019;t rile him up because I don&#x2019;t know what he would do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. But I am wondering one thing. Why are the limbs being cut off?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s to prevent the doctor from being hit with an arm or leg during the surgery. They&#x2019;re sold for surprisingly high prices to collectors. Moreover, did you see yesterday&#x2019;s news?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dr. J has a really fantastic mind. He used the parts that were thrown away to fake a mutilation murder case. Recently, there was a police officer sniffing around the missing children.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the firmly closed door opened and Dr. J entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He quietly approached the older cleaner and sliced his neck with a scalpel.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K... Keook...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blood sprayed out from the older cleaner&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Dr. J cleaned the blood from his hand and took out a cigarette before asking,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What did I say? I told you to watch your mouth. Hey, Newbie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes? Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The youth froze with surprise before replying.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now you&#x2019;re the main cleaner, and your salary will double. Have you learned everything about the job?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The youth smiled at the promotion and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know everything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then prepare that one. His body is rotten, but there might be a part that can be used.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. J smoked his cigarette as he laid the man on the operating table and started working.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After finishing everything, the doctor said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is one more in the afternoon so keep it clean. And remember to watch your mouth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Doctor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After finishing the cleaning, the young man went to eat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The menu was beef tripe and intestine soup.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin stared at the firmly closed door in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">Every time it was opened, one person in this room would be dragged out, never to come back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What happened to them?&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t want to imagine it, but it absolutely wasn&#x2019;t a good thing.</span></p><p><span style="">Even with her eyes that had become accustomed to darkness, she could only dimly see the outline of body.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin hugged her trembling body.</span></p><p><span style="">When she woke up, one arm had disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, the even sadder thing was that she lost the token of promise that she shared with her only friend.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The token she treasured on her little finger...</span></p><p><span style="">Tears suddenly poured down.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin was a child who didn&#x2019;t receive any love from an early age.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her mother left the house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her only remaining family, her father, saw her mother in Kim Soo-bin and abused her every day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, she left the house and wandered the streets, committing all types of dirty actions such as shoplifting.</span></p><p><span style="">It felt like paradise didn&#x2019;t exist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the police picked her up at a crime scene and she was taken to a facility.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Life there wasn&#x2019;t much different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was stamped with the stigma of a criminal so the eyes of the adults were cold.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If anything happened then she was suspected and beaten.</span></p><p><span style="">Just as she became resigned to suffering for eternity, Song Hye-mi appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people, who resembled each other so much so that it was like looking in a mirror, instantly became friends.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I want to be happy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">For the first time, that thought appeared in Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On that day, Kim Soo-bin was reborn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t do anything bad anymore and worked hard to develop her skills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wanted to live with Song Hye-mi as soon as she left the orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she stretched out her hand, then she thought she could catch the happiness that she craved.</span></p><p><span style="">But then she was kidnapped by unidentified people.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ddubeok...</span></i></p><p><span style="">At that time, Kim Soo-bin heard someone&#x2019;s footsteps.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was the only one remaining in this room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it finally her turn?</span></p><p><span style="">She had constantly wished that someone would save her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, when she was kidnapped, and when her arm was cut off, nobody came to her rescue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Maybe someone is coming to save me...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin didn&#x2019;t abandon hope until the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This couldn&#x2019;t be over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had a promise to keep.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Let&#x2019;s be happy together.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Then the door opened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s face distorted as she confirmed the appearance of the person.</span></p><p><span style="">That man.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man who cut off her arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aha, ahahaha! Be glad. It&#x2019;s finally your turn. Now you&#x2019;ll be able to live while surrounded by luxurious furniture. You can now eat all types of delicious foods, and be able to meet and have a loving relationship with a nice person. You&#x2019;ll now be able to spend your days in happiness.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin understood what the man&#x2019;s words meant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t the happiness that she wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;S-Spare me. I&apos;ll do anything... P-Plea... Oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The young cleaner standing behind Dr. J covered Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin struggled desperately to avoid being dragged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Dr. J clicked his tongue and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I should&#x2019;ve had someone cut off the remaining arm in advance. I&#x2019;ve been too busy these days. The death of one of you will bring happiness to over 10 people. Don&#x2019;t you think that is much better than living a tragic life?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. J stroked Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s head like he was complimenting her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then slowly, he injected an anesthetic into her neck.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s struggling body instantly relaxed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cleaner, pick her up. I didn&#x2019;t want to use this to maintain the freshness. Still, it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. It wasn&#x2019;t a strong dose so even if she doesn&#x2019;t move, her consciousness will still remain.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&apos;ve done all the preparations, doctor.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. J nodded with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You are quiet in comparison to your predecessor.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The cleaner carried Kim Soo-bin and headed to the operating room.</span></p><p><span style="">Dr. J said quietly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be careful. That girl you are carrying is worth 1.5 billion won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The scalp, artery, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, blood, skin, eyes, teeth, shoulders, heart, spleen, stomach, small intestines...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every single one of those organs were worth valuable money that couldn&#x2019;t be abandoned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even at the last minute, Kim Soo-bin was constantly thinking,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry... Hye-mi... I couldn&#x2019;t keep my promise...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at T Medical Center from a distance.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like an ordinary hospital, but there was something wicked and nefarious was happening in its basement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to blow it up.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It would be great if I was a bomber.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The important thing was justification.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk planned to inform the mass media about the existence of Phantom through the Doll Play event.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to do this, Shin Se-ho the PD had been steadily preparing.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;First of all, I have to capture what is happening here on camera. And...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He took the opera mask out of his bag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he felt calm as if cold water had been poured over him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opera mask had a specially made micro camera installed in it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything that Tae-hyuk saw and heard would be recorded in FHD.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After he collected all the evidence, he was going to use &#x2018;it&#x2019; in his bag.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t enter the basement area through the front door of the hospital, and had to pass through several gates in order to get there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk went over the barbed wire and headed to the back door of T Medical Center.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a security guard came running out of nowhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but this place is off-limits.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like the building had several CCTV cameras that weren&#x2019;t visible from the outside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Through it, they noticed the presence of a trespasser.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, he was carrying a big bag with no weapons.</span></p><p><span style="">The guard waved the rod at Tae-hyuk, threatening him so that he would leave.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was funny that the guard would threaten him with such a confident face.</span></p><p><span style="">[Violence has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Can use iron pipes.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed the distance to his opponent at once and swung the iron pipe at the opponent&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The security guard fell to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk registered his voice in the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he could use the Voice Modulation skill with no problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First I have to put him in a corner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk tied up the guard and brought him to a place that wasn&#x2019;t visible, then checked his belongings.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was the pass badge, rod, radio, phone, etc.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, the badge&#x2019;s security clearance was low so he couldn&#x2019;t go into the basement.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they would still be fairly useful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The atmosphere was important in this type of work.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered to the radio that was off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom is here. From now on, I will enter the enemy camp.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
