<p><span style="">Chapter 78 - Doll Play #4 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I don&#x2019;t have one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Look straight into my eyes and repeat that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk signalled Hyun-ho to look around the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hyun-ho nodded without speaking and searched the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The door to the basement that was hidden under the carpet wasn&#x2019;t so difficult to find.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk looked at the door with confidence.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The lack of dust gathered on it meant that it was frequently accessed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Master-nim. Sorry, but can I go in and check it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s face was pale as his shoulders slumped, seeming like he didn&#x2019;t have the energy left to answer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk grabbed the opponent&#x2019;s arm so he couldn&#x2019;t escape and went down to the basement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was only one light bulb flashing inside the small room, with a woman tied up inside with a doll.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-Are you alright? Don&#x2019;t worry. I am the police.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oof! Oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman desperately shook her body and banged her head against the wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the identity of the sound that he had heard.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out his handcuffs and put them around Yoo Ho-jin&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am arresting you for kidnapping! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. &#xA0;You have the right to an attorney, and the right to have the attorney speak for you when you are asked a question. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sob...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While Kang-suk was reading the Miranda rights, Hyun-ho was untying the woman.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...T-Thank you for saving me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho&#x2019;s eyes widened as he confirmed her identity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, but are you Ryu Myung-hwa?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, that&#x2019;s right...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae! It&#x2019;s Ryu Myung-hwa, the actress who went missing a month ago!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, she was dramatically rescued from a criminal by Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">They searched the basement and the attic, but couldn&#x2019;t find any traces of anyone being killed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk was praised by Kim Do-shik for resolving the disappearance of Ryu Myung-hwa.</span></p><p><span style="">But no matter how he thought about it, he couldn&#x2019;t feel clean at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he couldn&#x2019;t find anything on the mutilation murderer.</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho was already inside the interrogation room, but Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t wait outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hyun-ho, sorry but I will be substituting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Geez, a senior is trying to take away his junior&#x2019;s rice bowl.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go already. Either that, or you can watch from the sidelines.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You two have a good time, I&#x2019;ll be eating some rice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho hummed before disappearing, leaving only Cho Kang-suk and Yoo Ho-jin left inside the interrogation room.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sat on the chair and looked at the man on the other side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The doll artist seemed to have become 10 years older as he stared into the air with a blank expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before Kang-suk could speak, Yoo Ho-jin opened his mouth first.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective-nim. I kidnapped Myung-hwa. However, I didn&#x2019;t kill anyone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">I have nothing to do with the mutilations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Anybody would become psychologically nervous when sitting handcuffed in a room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In such an atmosphere, the criminal tended to confess.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So tell me the reason why a famous artist like you would kidnap Ryu Myung-hwa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although he had been branded as a criminal, Kang-suk treated him as a human being.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin replied with a look of pleasure,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted a doll.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doll?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. No matter how perfect a human is, they can&#x2019;t be truly perfect. Therefore, I decided to make the most beautiful doll in the world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk inwardly sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What type of artist was this?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t understand. That doesn&#x2019;t explain why you kidnapped Ryu Myung-hwa.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I wanted a doll that resembled her, a beauty that would last forever. But it wasn&#x2019;t easy, since I couldn&#x2019;t express everything I wanted. So I think I became crazy for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was why he kidnapped a person and locked her in the basement?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You didn&#x2019;t harm her, and you also don&#x2019;t have a criminal record, so it will be three year sentence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you. I was able to come back to my senses thanks to Detective-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the doll play of the artist who wanted to make the most perfect doll was over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin suddenly called out the leaving Kang-suk, as if he remembered something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, could you please wait a moment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ve been thinking about it. Decorating a Christmas tree with doll parts. I did a very similar work two years ago. That work was definitely bought...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gulped.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you tell me then I will lighten your sentence as much as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ho-jin spoke hesitantly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe I should say sorry in advance. Someone from China bought it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was almost impossible to find the whereabouts of a foreigner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective-nim, I hope you catch the killer. At any rate, I&#x2019;m sorry for the inconvenience.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please say that to the victim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The first doll play was solved by Detective Cho Kang-suk of Gangdong Police Station&#x2019;s 2nd team.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Cho Kang-suk eventually couldn&#x2019;t figure out the answer to the second doll play.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That incident seemed to be falling into a labyrinth.</span></p><p><span style="">A huge reversal was waiting.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, did you find a good way to make money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama greeted Tae-hyuk with a light smile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was the owner of a pawn shop and was also a forgery specialist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was an open secret that she was also a trader in buying and selling information.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you have the information for T Medical Center that I previously requested?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a strange light flashed in Big Mama&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I felt like I was poking around a fortress.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A merchant sells goods and the customer pays. However, I am busy so please make this short.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said this with a smile and Big Mama laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When she first met him six months ago, he had known nothing, but now he was a criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I have prepared it. This one is a little expensive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nine million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is cheaper than I thought.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my. Your hands are getting bigger. Did you win the lottery or something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I got something better than the lottery.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama didn&#x2019;t ask further.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you have any questions about the real estate market, then don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama received the money from Tae-hyuk, put it in a safe, and then pulled out a bunch of papers from a box under the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The transaction of a company&#x2019;s secrets was completed as if he was buying a drink.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I read it here?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat down in Big Mama&#x2019;s workroom like it was his own home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The volume of the report was nice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">On the surface, it seemed to be a medical menter that was implementing noblesse oblige.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They regularly provided medical support to the orphanages in the city, and even provided free hospitalization for injured children.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there were two unusual things about T Medical Center.</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, the percentage of Chinese patients was strangely high.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was said that there were a large number of wealthy Koreans living in China and that they often came to T Medical Center for difficult surgeries.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, it was an overwhelming proportion compared to the Korean patients.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This concludes all the information that could be obtained legally. And now, it is time for the illegal content.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk turned the page.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike the previous page, this ink was different.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um... It disappears when exposed to air.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could only read it once.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk paid careful attention to each letter of the report.</span></p><p><span style="">T Medical Center strictly kept it a secret, but the frequency of organ transplants was much higher than other hospitals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was as if T Medical Center itself existed only for organ transplantation.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;First, let me organize the case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The first thing that happened was the disappearance of actress Ryu Myung-hwa.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After that, the children living in orphanages started to disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed to be a type of causal relationship; however, they had nothing to do with each other.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The children in the Seoul orphanages started to disappear and after a while, their arms and legs were found decorating a tree.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like a horrific mutilation murder case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Disappearing children</span></p><p>Health screenings on a regular basis.&#xA0;<span style="">The rich people from China coming here for surgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A hospital that specialized in organ transplants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All the pieces of the puzzle were revealed one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was hit with a sudden wave of fatigue.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If his reasoning was correct, this was an atrocious crime that didn&#x2019;t regard the children as humans.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;In the first place, this isn&#x2019;t a mutilation murder case, it was just made to look like that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A bizarre doll play event that decorated the tree with body parts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was done to make it look like murder.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is kidnapping for organ&#xA0;trafficking.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk reached the truth of the incident.</span></p><p><span style="">The police were trying to catch a murderer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to do this, they mobilized a nationwide investigation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they couldn&#x2019;t catch the culprit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was natural.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the first place, the mutilation murderer didn&#x2019;t exist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This was the reason why it ended unsolved. The problem is logic, because the police were solving the wrong equation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk searched the Internet for news on his smartphone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was easy to find some relevant articles.</span></p><p><span style="">[Since earlier this year, organ transplant from death row prisoners is legally forbidden in China.]</span></p><p><span style="">China used to take the organs of death row prisoners and sell them for a lot of money to patients who needed transplants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It earned hundreds of millions of won every year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, as the controversy over human rights violation persisted, it eventually became prohibited by law.</span></p><p><span style="">The Chinese medical community showed that the number of patients who need organ transplants every year in their country went up to 300,000, and that the actual number of organ transplant recipients was only 10,000.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, most of them were organs form the death row prisoners.</span></p><p><span style="">But now that had become impossible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Demand was overflowing but the supply was gone.</span></p><p><span style="">Then what would happen?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk suddenly recalled a ghost story circulating the Internet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were a large number of homeless people in front of the station and volunteers would come to give them bread and milk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the next morning, the place where the homeless people should&#x2019;ve been was empty.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was one error in this ghost story.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The organ&#xA0;rating was assigned according to the health status.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no way that the organs of old or sick people would be sold at an expensive price.</span></p><p><span style="">Then, what if the organs were young and healthy? </span><span style="">There were also regular health checks to keep the organs at their best.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Indeed, those ones would sell at an expensive price.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk became nauseous as he thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">The children were orphans.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no family to mourn them if they disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Nobody would look for them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The police would report them as simple runaways and not even investigate properly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were the best prey for an organ trafficking ring.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled the children he met at St. Mary&#x2019;s Orphanage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a troublemaker who always drew on Kang-suk and the walls, and he wanted to become an artist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Some girls even cried at the dresses that Kang-suk gave them, since it was the first time they wore such pretty clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">T Medical Center was literally playing with dolls.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They destroyed the arms of the expensive dolls, and then they fixed it for a cheap price.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such a terrible thing was still occurring somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Fury filled Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk put on the mask and became Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom muttered quietly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will leave it to Cho Kang-suk to become angry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Freshness was vital for organ&#xA0;trafficking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe a lot of the survivors were being held somewhere in T Medical Center.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After saving them...</span></p><p><span style="">Smash T Medical Center.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I will finish this case. I don&#x2019;t feel like giving it up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had promised to rescue Kim Soo-bin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could also get huge rewards from solving it.</span></p><p><span style="">This incident was the best chance to announce the Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">For all of that...</span></p><p><span style="">It was Phantom, the God of Crime&#x2019;s turn.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
