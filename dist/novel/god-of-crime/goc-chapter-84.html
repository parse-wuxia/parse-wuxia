<p><span style="">Chapter 84 - I am a Noble #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, since you&#x2019;re accepted into university now, what are you going to do in school now? In the meantime, we will be studying for the entrance exams.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. I want to finish one year of studies in advance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young nodded and explained.</span></p><p><span style="">For example, medical school was two years long.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology etc.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once she entered this course, there would be no room for liberal arts subjects due to the tight schedule.&#xA0;</span><span style="">General chemistry, organic chemistry, general biology, cell biology, molecular biology, genetics and so on...&#xA0;</span><span style="">After two years of preliminary study, she would enter the main course and start studying to become a full-fledged doctor.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">Study for studying...</span></p><p><span style="">He instantly imagined dozens of student doctors sitting in white robes with dark circles under their eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a great feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That isn&#x2019;t it. Anyway, I like it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young replied with an embarrassed face.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">As promised in the morning, Tae-hyuk would go to the downtown general hospital to meet An Eun-young&#x2019;s mother.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her father was the director there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you will go there to work after graduating?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uhh. Perhaps not? I&#x2019;m just studying hard so that I can follow in my father&#x2019;s footsteps.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young had a definite plan for her future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk dropped his gaze with a sullen expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m envious, as I still haven&#x2019;t decided what university to go to yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Would you like to take a field trip to my university on the weekend? There aren&#x2019;t any undergraduates there yet because it&#x2019;s still winter vacation, but the professors and research students will be there. You will surely find something!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can I go?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I talked to my department head. S University also has campus tours, so it&#x2019;ll be a good experience.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was careful not to let An Eun-young see his smirk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was subtle, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be good if she saw it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This allowed him to enter her school very naturally.</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk rejoiced, An Eun-young also smiled happily.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyway, we really have become quite close if I can talk to Class President like this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As for An Eun-young, she wanted to be more than friends with Tae-hyuk; unfortunately, he didn&#x2019;t think that far yet.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Then the problem of access is solved. First of all, I need to gather information from the robotics department.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As An Eun-young agonized on whether she should hold his hand, Tae-hyuk was plotting a crime.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sorry, would you like to go first? &#xA0;The weather is cold these days and I&#x2019;m just going to buy a blanket for my mother. I should&#x2019;ve prepared it in advance but I forgot. If you go to the room then Unni should be there. Ah right, didn&#x2019;t you meet her the other day?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young cautiously said once she was in front of the hospital.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A few days ago, her sister had come back to visit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded as he looked at the hospital room number.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-jeong noona? It&#x2019;s been a long time since I last saw her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Wasn&#x2019;t a few days ago the first time you saw her?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said nothing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was an event with Eun-jeong but they had decided to keep it a secret from Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is it okay when she reacted to me like a rat seeing a cat?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and entered the hospital.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was moving to an area where the patients had significantly low immune levels.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to go there, he had to remove the germs from his body and wear a cotton garment provided by the hospital.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Was it F floor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk got on the elevator and pressed the floor that Eun-mi, An Eun-jeong&#x2019;s mother was hospitalized on.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He arrived on the fourth floor with a loud ding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The air was strangely changed, and felt similar to the Death Circus or T Medical Centre.</span></p><p><span style="">[Spying has found an image of intense death.]</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;You shut up.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk waved his hand in the air and made the Demon Revealing Mirror disappear.</span></p><p><span style="">But the atmosphere was unusual.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Doctors and nurses were running around holding charts.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk went to the reception and informed the nurse about his visit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She handed him a pass with a nice smile and told him to go to the room at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk got a bad feeling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After going through several controlled doors, he entered a sealed, clean room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The nurse guarding the door looked at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s pass and opened the door without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a large room with a glass door that made it possible to see inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a sterile room so that visitors could see the patient inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, people were doing something around the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Vitals check?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Quickly get the defibrillator ready!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Her heart is stopping!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong was sitting next to the bed and whispering to the middle-aged woman lying down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-young is coming now to visit... Mama... Please... Just hold on for a little longer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized what was happening.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a situation where death could no longer be held back.</span></p><p><span style="">And the pulse on the graph became flat &#x4E00;.</span></p><p><span style="">The doctors saw her condition and covered her body with the white bed sheet.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Time of death is 4:10 p.m on the 6th of January.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong buried her face in the bed sheets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk opened the door and silently went inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The the doctor spoke in a slightly shaky voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you come to visit? I&#x2019;m sorry. If I knew this would happen, then I would have given permission one hour earlier...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The doctor said before leaving.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The nurse at the side said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At least someone was with her at the last moments.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly screamed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young wasn&#x2019;t here right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just knowing this fact made him feel terrible. Then how would An Eun-young, a family member, feel?&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a little late because she was buying a gift.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, her mother passed away.</span></p><p><span style="">What would Eun-young feel after realizing this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young had studied hard in the hope of making her mother feel better.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She just got into the university that she wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What could he say to her, who would be rushing in to share the good news?</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining nurses quietly disappeared in consideration of the family members.</span></p><p><span style="">The crying An Eun-jeong slowly lifted her head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she moaned as she saw Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What happened to Eun-young...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;She is a little late because she was buying a present.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After a moment, Eun-jeong started talking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mama... A few days ago, I was very healthy. I ate well... I said sorry for what happened and was forgiven... I laughed so much... I thought I could be a good daughter from now on, but it seems I was a little late.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong&#x2019;s voice was shaky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Could I have changed the ending if I was aware of it?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had memories of the future but he didn&#x2019;t know everything.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I wanted to tell her directly that I got into university, not through the phone.</span></i> <i><span style="">Won&#x2019;t she compliment me then?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Eun-young&#x2019;s smiling face popped into his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young had put forth an incredible effort in order to hear those words, but now it would be for nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt some incredibly complicated emotions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t like this ending.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young had helped Tae-hyuk become a model student.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Due to her existence, he was able to know the existence of An Eun-jeong, Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s friend.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want it to just end like this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;At the very least, I want her to tell her mother that she got into university. Is there some way?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk checked the crime skills using the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had knowledge of the future, but it wasn&#x2019;t possible to animate the dead.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only way...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Yes. I can do that.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">He decided to distort reality and present a false memory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But to do that, he had to get Eun-mi&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-jeong noona. Do you have your mother&#x2019;s voice recorded anywhere?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh...yes? Mother&#x2019;s voice is on the home answering machine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had never done it this way before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By default, he had to meet the person directly in order to imitate the voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was impossible to have a conversation with someone who was dead.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What would happen if he heard her recorded voice?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded and called Eun-young&#x2019;s house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">About 30 seconds, it switched to the answering machine.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-This is An Jeong-hun, Lee Eun-mi, An Eun-jeong and An Eun-young&#x2019;s house.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;m sorry but no one is at home because everyone is working hard.</span></i> <i><span style="">Please leave your phone number and we will call you back.</span></i></p><p><span style="">[Lee Eun-mi&#x2019;s voice has been registered.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The Voice Modulation skill can imitate Lee Eun-mi&#x2019;s voice.]</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, the voice was successfully registered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-jeong, who was listening beside Tae-hyuk, started to cry again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was still part of the family message despite living away from home for several years.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;M-Mother...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The sheet cover Lee Eun-mi flowed down to reveal her face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her eyes were closed like she was sleeping in a relaxed manner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was she happy because her daughter, who had left home, had returned at the last moment?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. I&apos;ll be outside for a while.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk went out of the room and saw An Jeong-hun, whom he had met a week ago, coming with tearful eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Honey...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t want to disturb the family members so he quietly headed to the waiting room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used the phone there to call Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He manipulated the Demon Revealing Mirror to gain the voice of Lee Eun-mi.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Our daughter! Why are you so late?&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-M-Mama?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;I &#xA0;have been waiting for you. How long does it take to buy a good gift?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I-I&#x2019;m sorry.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&apos;ll go up right now.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mother heard from Tae-hyuk. What&#x2019;s the good news?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then An Eun-young&#x2019;s voice brightened.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">I got into S University!</span></i> <i><span style="">I will study hard to make Mother better.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Great, our daughter. Congratulations! Look, isn&#x2019;t that a hard task? So don&#x2019;t study too much! Go eat delicious things and play around. I&#x2019;m sorry that I couldn&#x2019;t make breakfast for you before you took the exam. Still, our daughter is doing so well that Mother is happy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hehehe...</span></i> <i><span style="">Mama, there is no need.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-young. I will always be behind you so live well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-M-Mama?</span></i> <i><span style="">W-What are you saying so suddenly.</span></i> <i><span style="">M-Mama...!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Eun-young started to call out for her mother as she got a bad feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-young, our daughter, I love you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hung up.</span></p><p><span style="">He was sure that Lee Eun-mi would&#x2019;ve said something like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he hid in the hallway and looked at the room where Eun-mi was.</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-young ran inside holding two lap blankets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She hadn&#x2019;t been able to decide which was better.</span></p><p><span style="">Was this really okay?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk wondered if what he did was helpful to Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The last conversation with her mother was a false reality made by Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-young had been deeply happy to hear the congratulations.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like all the efforts she had gone through had been rewarded.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat on the floor and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a lie.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A despicable crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But at least she had the memory of a last conversation with her mother.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Lee Eun-mi knew...</span></p><p><span style="">Then an amazing thing happened.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have assimilated with Lee Eun-mi and conveyed her heart.]</span></p><p><span style="">[You have succeeded in distorting reality and making a soft miracle.]</span></p><p><span style="">There was a notification that he acquired a new skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[The top skill Disguise has been acquired.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can disguise yourself with the face of someone you have met. </span></p><p><span style="">The new crime skill, Disguise!</span></p><p><span style="">It was on a completely different realm from Voice Modulation where he could only change his voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now he would be able to turn his face into someone else&#x2019;s, along with their voice.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a skill that Tae-hyuk needed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk was more concerned about the message that said he had assimilated with Lee Eun-mi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was clear that...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eun-young. It is like this. I&#x2019;m sure that your mother is proud of you too. Congrats on your acceptance into university.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk closed his eyes as he spoke Lee Eun-mi&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
