<p><span style="">Chapter 20 - Criminals #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk knew of a thief in the immediate vicinity.</span></p><p><span style="">He had just witnessed a thief trying to cross a wall as he returned from Eun-young&#x2019;s house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t a hero or police officer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was no benefit then there was no reason to catch other criminals.</span></p><p><span style="">But now it was different, as it was likely that she had robbed his house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had visibly looked very clumsy; however, the thief who stole Rosario didn&#x2019;t seem that good either.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to confirm if they were the same person.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ran to the high-class residential area where there were always thieves.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... There!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The scene wasn&#x2019;t much different than it was 30 minutes ago. </span></p><p><span style="">He hid his body in the darkness and watched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she had Rosario, then he could steal it using Robbery.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She still hasn&#x2019;t climbed the fence.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She was worried about how to enter the yard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what if it was just a performance...?</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Something different happened than usual.</span></p><p><span style="">The thief huffed angrily and kicked the wall with her feet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, this caused tremendous pain, so she grabbed her toes and started rolling on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes widened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For the first time, Tae-hyuk was able to see the face of the female thief.</span></p><p><span style="">He almost screamed at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;T-that woman!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The thief was a person that Tae-hyuk knew.</span></p><p><span style="">She had long black hair that flowed down to her waist, and a butterfly mask on her face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it to hide her identity?&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, half of the face was clearly revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is Moonlight Flower!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She was in her early 20s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was 10 years younger than what Tae-hyuk remembered.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the other person was also astonished to see him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaak! T-thief!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... You shouldn&#x2019;t be the one saying that. Who is the thief?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk angrily replied to Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a thief. You must be mistaken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That argument is hardly convincing when wearing such clothes... You completely look like a thief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower looked down at her body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was dressed in tight clothing that showed off her body. Many of her body parts were highlighted.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower shrieked again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaak! Where are you looking?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower covered her chest with both arms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to cover something exceptionally large. </span><span style="">Still, the size meant that it couldn&#x2019;t be completely hidden.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a wry smile.</span></p><p><span style=""> &#x2018;I never expected to meet Moonlight Flower here, of all places.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She was a capable thief who started her activities approximately four years from now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She primarily aimed at banks, large corporations, and also conglomerates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rather than stealing money or objects, she was famous for leaving marks of her visit. </span><span style="">She would enter a vault filled with gold bars, taking nothing and leaving after leaving a sign, showing that she was there.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For example, she would break into a museum and vandalize a painting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She only aimed for the richest, and also had a cute appearance. The youthful personality meant that she would become popular and have a large fan club.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Four years later. Did she work before her name was known?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">It was unlikely that Moonlight Flower had robbed his house. </span><span style="">However, he needed to check to confirm it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had kicked a wall, so it seemed like she couldn&#x2019;t move properly.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk moved quickly and narrowed the distance to Moonlight Flower.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower, who had fallen to the ground, instantly got up and started to run away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A thief with sore feet...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ran to catch the opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he was shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">One of Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s feet was obviously hurting, yet she was running at such a quick speed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The distance between the two people gradually started to widen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;W-what is this speed?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The movements were unexpected from someone who couldn&#x2019;t even climb a wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk exclaimed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute! I have no intention of catching you. I just want to ask you something!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Heheng! Do you think I will be convinced by that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The distance widened from five metres to twenty metres in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">He was going to end up missing her.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Biiiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment. There was the sound of a whistle.</span></p><p><span style="">There were police patrolling nearby.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two senior policemen and one junior policeman approached Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk panted as he pointed in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-thief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to see the back of Moonlight Flower, who was currently running away. The policeman nodded like he already knew.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a perfect grasp of these streets. We will go chase them. Students, please take this path.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A group of three people ran through the streets in order to catch Moonlight Flower.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk chased after Moonlight Flower, while the policemen were circling around to build a net.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had a very good knowledge of this area.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She will be caught soon.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower had great physical abilities, so Tae-hyuk would never be able to catch her alone.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was four against one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, one of the policemen had perfectly grasped the geography.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Wait. Should I let Moonlight Flower get caught?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was important that Tae-hyuk recover Roasario.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if Moonlight Flower wasn&#x2019;t the criminal, he shouldn&#x2019;t let her get caught.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He suddenly came up with a good idea.</span></p><p><span style="">He ignored the policemen and entered a side street.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He climbed up to the roof of a house and confirmed the location of Moonlight Flower and the policemen.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Isn&#x2019;t she clearly being surrounded?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was able to read the plan from this height.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk discovered the final destination and decided to wait there.</span></p><p><span style="">The policemen were herding Moonlight Flower like she was a rabbit. In no time, she was in a dead end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moonlight Flower could escape if she climbed over the wall, but she couldn&#x2019;t do so with an injured foot.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Grab on! Quickly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk extended his hand to Moonlight Flower from his position on the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower looked at Tae-hyuk with a confused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Didn&#x2019;t he want to catch her?</span></p><p><span style="">Yet Tae-hyuk suddenly appeared and shouted like he was planning to rescue Moonlight Flower.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Damn, just do it! They are coming!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke again as Moonlight Flower kept hesitating.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you don&#x2019;t grab my hand in three seconds then I am running away alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;O-Okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower grabbed the hand of the angry Tae-hyuk and climbed the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">Then both of them ran away with all their strength.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">***</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk arrived at a safe place and calmed his breathing.</span></p><p><span style="">Whether it was because they wanted the reward for catching the thief or a holiday, the policemen were really persistent.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They had ran for over an hour and barely managed to escape. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pant...! Keok...! Really great stamina... How are you fine after running...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. I have confidence in my stamina.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, she couldn&#x2019;t do something as basic as climb a wall. A strange thief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After confirming that they were safe, Moonlight Flower made an odd expression. Then she asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why did you save me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I wasn&#x2019;t trying to catch you. Is this answer enough? Besides, I&#x2019;m also a thief.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then why were you chasing me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Didn&#x2019;t you try to rob my house a few hours ago? This is my area. It is a violation of the rules to invade my area. I was trying to tell you this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The movements of Moonlight Flower stopped completely.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="">He had met a lot of thieves in prison, and learned that they had their own laws.</span></p><p><span style="">Was it because he saved her from being caught? Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s expression softened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Eung. I didn&#x2019;t go anywhere today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had completely caught her.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Someone aimed for my house and I was robbed today. It really wasn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower responded &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">She was surprisingly naive. </span><span style="">It was a good type to be scammed.</span></p><p><span style="">The control of the conversation was completely in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands. She was physically better than Tae-hyuk, but he had 10 years of experience.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you telling me the truth? You might have hidden the stolen item somewhere on your body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a smile. It was a speech that would touch the person&#x2019;s hidden intentions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then check it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower huffed angrily.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He hadn&#x2019;t expected that it would come to this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was wearing leather clothes that exposed her body. There was not much space to hide anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why, just do it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower came up to Tae-hyuk, grabbed his hand, and placed it on her chest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he was touching a soft marshmallow.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face reddened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nothing? Is this still lacking? Do you want to check anywhere else?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk blushed and coughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Cough. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His tone had changed to speaking in honorifics.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In addition, I think that you are mistaken about something. Come along with me for a moment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower grabbed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hand and pulled him back to the original location.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the place where she tried to cross the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know that you think I was trying to rob this house... Oh, don&#x2019;t get me wrong! It is just my hobby! This is actually my house!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She emphasized it again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My house!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower even took a key out from her pocket and opened the gate.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Look. Right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">So she was trying to climb the wall of her own house.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Indeed, Moonlight Flower... I really can&#x2019;t understand her. Really...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, are you really a thief? It is suspicious. Aren&#x2019;t you going to show me proof?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s eyes narrowed with doubt.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quickly pulled out the Demon Revealing Mirror from his pocket and prepared a skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. Let me show you the evidence. &quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk started slowly walking and bumped Moonlight Flower in the shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Please select the item you want to steal!</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now, let&#x2019;s steal something suitable.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror to see what would come up.</span></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden, Moonlight Flower rushed towards Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! What is that thing? Cute!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a mirror with a demon engraved on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he had seen a reaction like this.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk chose randomly from the list due to Moonlight Flower.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;W-what! What did I steal this time?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Tae-hyuk searched through his pocket, and touched a piece of soft cloth.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;D-Don&apos;t tell me...?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, it was the butterfly mask on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled it out and waved it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, when did you steal this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower ran to Tae-hyung, grabbed the mask, and put it on her face again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Did you see?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You saw! My face!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words. In the first place, the butterfly mask was already half falling off. Did she think it would hide her identity?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, do you believe that I&#x2019;m a thief now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower placed her hands on her waist and turned her head to the side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah. Your skills still have a long way to go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The one speaking was someone who couldn&#x2019;t even climb the wall of her own house.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk just extended his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Either way, this is a relationship. How about exchanging information among business partners?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thieves had their own network. It ranged from places to dispose of stolen goods to equipment deals. </span><span style="">Even if it was still early, Moonlight Flower was a thief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was likely that she knew more information than Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what Tae-hyuk was aiming for.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower moaned pathetically.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to help her make a decision.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In exchange for becoming business partners... I&#x2019;ll take what I just saw to the grave.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... You did see! Bah! It can&#x2019;t be helped. Should I give you my cell phone number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower said in a strange voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah. You got a phone number through this outrageous method.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a dumbfounded expression and held out his cell phone.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Moonlight Flower approached Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel something soft leaning against his arm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk coughed. He couldn&#x2019;t control the blood in his body due to the good food that An Eun-young made.</span></p><p><span style="">His face turned red as he felt Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s soft body.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An old fashioned phone... By the way, why are you blushing? How old are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is my 2nd year of high school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The cell phone seems to be the same age. At any rate, I am your Noona! Cutie, what is your name?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Seo Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Noona is called Moonlight Flower. A pseudonym.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower then left her contact details in Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s phone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Hrmm. Her real name is Yoo Ha-yang.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower had registered her number with her real name, not her pseudonym. He was starting to doubt whether she really wanted to hide her identity.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sent a short text to the number entered by Moonlight Flower. </span><span style="">It was to exchange contact details.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyway, I believe that Moonlight Flower is a thief. I can take advantage of this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then, Tae-hyuk! By careful when walking the streets at night!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Moonlight Flower noona should be careful not to get hurt when falling from the wall. Be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t fall!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said goodbye and started walking home.</span></p><p><span style="">To Moonlight Flower, stealing was a &#x2018;hobby.&#x2019; It didn&#x2019;t matter if she was just a clumsy novice now, as her growth potential was tremendous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;She has really good physical capabilities... I can use this.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">Above all, her chest was big.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
