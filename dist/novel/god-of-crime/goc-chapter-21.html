<p><span style="">Chapter 21 - Criminals #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower wasn&#x2019;t the culprit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk had checked her belongings using the Robbery skill, and Rosario wasn&#x2019;t among them.</span></p><p><span style="">If so, who was the thief who robbed his house?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk first thought about how to find the real thief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, it was hard right now, as they might be looking for other prey or hiding in their shelter.</span></p><p><span style="">Night was the time of the thief. </span><span style="">It was difficult to specify the position of his free moving target.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My opponent is a thief who targets this area.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Thieves were extremely territorial.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So most of the time, they would continue to work in their &#x2018;designated territory.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the reason why thieves were often caught in the same area.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Some time had passed since the crime was committed, and it was impossible to find the thief&apos;s whereabouts right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk utilized all of his knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There is a place where a thief who commits a crime must go. I need to go there.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">A thief had to dispose of the items they had stolen and change it into money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The so-called person who &#x2018;received stolen goods.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Most of them would buy the goods at a reasonable price.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In some cases, they would hire a thief directly if there was something they absolutely needed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They wouldn&#x2019;t directly dirty their hands and would receive huge benefits.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a small problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I have never been to one...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">A broker of stolen goods had their own nest.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk remembered there was a broker who managed a thief near Cheonggyecheon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But he had only heard about if through a thief at the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know who the stolen goods broker was.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, what they did was illegal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t like a chicken house that would be advertised on flyers.</span></p><p><span style="">If he knew this, then he would&#x2019;ve listened more carefully...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I had known, then I would&#x2019;ve memorized the lottery numbers. First of all, I have to make the most of what I know.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to meet up with the broker.</span></p><p><span style="">He had the crime skills, and he could take advantage of it. Then he would be able to get what he wanted.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">The sun was rising as Tae-hyuk stretched out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He got up and went through some light stretches.</span></p><p><span style="">On his desk was a reference book recommended by An Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">After school ended, he would learn directly from her. Other than that, he needed to study by himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My stats didn&#x2019;t go up today...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If the study skill wasn&#x2019;t present, then it took him almost 10 times longer for his stats to rise.</span></p><p><span style="">In order for Tae-hyuk to be on a similar level to An Eun-young, he needed to raise his school rank by almost 200. </span><span style="">It needed to be done within a month.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would&#x2019;ve been impossible if he didn&#x2019;t have the help of the studying skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I would love to spend all day with Eun-young but...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">She had her own life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t do that.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he had to study alone while An Eun-young was at school.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why am I desperately trying to become 1st in the school...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t complain to anyone.</span></p><p><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror showed that he had dark circles under his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one person who would come and see it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is An Eun-young.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help but sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Anyway, it is time for the stolen goods broker to do business.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Thieves worked at night, and would check their equipment as they disposed of stolen items during the day.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, this was the broker&#x2019;s main activity time.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk searched through his vague memories as he headed to Cheonggyecheon.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it this place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid in a back alley and looked at a building.</span></p><p><span style="">On the surface, it was a pawn shop that didn&#x2019;t seem that suspicious.</span></p><p><span style="">The problem was the people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Everybody has a tired face, as if they couldn&#x2019;t sleep at night. Uh, that person just yawned.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, the person exited after five minutes and was carrying a thick bundle of money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no sense of urgency when they entered the pawn shop.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is the correct answer. They&#x2019;re all thieves!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">10 people entered in just one hour.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;There are so many thieves in the country.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This was why no matter how many taxes was paid, there was always a deficiency.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was nothing good about facing other thieves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk waited for all the customers of the pawn shop to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, is it Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A sleepy voice was heard from behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower was standing there while yawning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Moonlight Flower noona?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike yesterday, Moonlight Flower was wearing normal clothes.</span></p><p><span style="">However she was wearing dark sunglasses to hide her identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wasn&#x2019;t able to concede one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Jeans and a top that shows her belly... It is better than the leather clothes she wore yesterday...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, the exposure was too high.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know where to look.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower approached and plastered herself onto Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">Then she spoke in a chirpy voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you come to get supplies from Mama?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes shone.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The broker is called Mama?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mama? Yes, I wanted to buy something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh ~ Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like he could take advantage of meeting Moonlight Flower here.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked with a sly expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did that house from yesterday not belong to Noona? No, you couldn&#x2019;t even cross the wall properly. Why are you going to a broker of stolen goods...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s face turned red. She waved her hands and exclaimed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, I&apos;m not trying to dispose of stolen goods! Yesterday, I accidentally broke a stick. I&#x2019;m trying to get a new one...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You should be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded with a convinced look.</span></p><p><span style="">Thieves would also buy things from brokers, as the brokers also sold equipment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Moonlight Flower had a variety of tools. She wouldn&#x2019;t have bought them from an auction, so most of them would be purchased here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I came to buy equipment. What did Tae-hyuk come to buy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s not it. I need information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. Obviously, there is something that you are looking for. That other thief must have stolen it. Then, did you come to the broker to ask if somebody had come to the store to sell it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought that she was just a stupid thief. However, she was smarter than he thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower smiled at the expression on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face and poked his cheek.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahah, is that the answer? You shouldn&#x2019;t make fun of a woman&#x2019;s senses.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;. Please keep it a secret from Mama. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice to share each other&#x2019;s secrets?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He needed to ensure that Moonlight Flower didn&#x2019;t reveal it.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower folded her arms and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I&#x2019;ll won&#x2019;t reveal it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But isn&#x2019;t Noona curious about the thief who ignored the rules and invaded someone else&#x2019;s territory?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I am curious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then do you want to go with me? Don&#x2019;t you have something to do here anyway?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is that so? I also didn&#x2019;t want to go alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will be the one talking. Just watch from the sidelines.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s go!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower seemed to be familiar with the stolen goods broker. If he entered with her, then the broker&#x2019;s wariness would reduce. He would be able to obtain what he wanted earlier.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Shall I get some information about Mama from Moonlight Flower?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked casually.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You seem to come here often.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mama&#x2019;s store was on a corner of an alley in Cheonggyecheon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It looked like any other ordinary pawn shop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A place that lend money for goods received.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the most famous place for handling stolen jewellery in the area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The important thing was for the broker to evaluate the goods and calculate the correct price.</span></p><p><span style="">Among the items that the thieves handled, there were many fakes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was up to the broker to judge the stolen goods.</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower started talking about things that Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t even ask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a person who would be called an enemy to herself.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stored the things Moonlight Flower told him in his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Information was always valuable.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&apos;s go.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Moonlight Flower opened the door and entered the pawn shop.</span></p><p><span style="">A woman who was painting stood up and welcomed them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Welcome. How can I help you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The woman seemed to be in her early 30s. She was dressed in black mourning clothes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A beautiful woman who gave off a mature atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, Ajumma! I came here to ask you something. Well, not exactly me but this guy.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo. It is Moonlight. Come on. Didn&#x2019;t I tell you to call me unni, instead of ajumma?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand! Mama unni!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will say it one more time, if you call me ajumma then I will stick a knife in your belly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha... I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mama laughed, but she had a strange expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is he your boyfriend? Well, you are pretty. Why are you just standing there?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nope. He is just a younger brother that I know. He is a little naive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Anyway, I&#x2019;ll go and get some cold drinks. Wait here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Moonlight Flower talked in a familiar manner to Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was just watching with an open mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I should have noticed when I heard the name Mama. I didn&#x2019;t think that it would be Big Mama.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was one of the big criminal brokers.</span></p><p><span style="">She dealt with counterfeit art that went into the range of tens of billions of won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was a representative of South Korea, just like the Russian or American mafias.</span></p><p><span style="">He had entered the lair of a tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I-I have to get out of here!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Mama spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, Moonlight. Your brother is trying to run away? However, I hope he knows that this place is free to enter, but not free to leave.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wanted to cry.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
