<p><span style="">Chapter 111 - Jail War #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Soon after breakfast time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t take long for the guards to realize that something was wrong.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This group of scum is crazy!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even though it was time for some work, a few people were gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The new guard next to him giggled and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are they lazing off after eating?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We will put them all in solitary confinement. Let&#x2019;s go see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand, Sunbae-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The new prison guard was filled with a strange confidence shortly after arriving here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt like a hero judging heinous criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He twirled his rod and entered one of the cells.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Number 304! What are you doing? Go to work!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man sitting on the toilet raised his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The face that had been fine just yesterday was now in pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Number 304 groaned and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Guard-nim. I&#x2019;m sorry. M-My stomach...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, what is this smell? Finish up and come out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cell next door had a similar situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, it was worse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;F-Finish quickly! I don&#x2019;t want to see this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It keeps coming. I can&#x2019;t stop it in the middle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;F-Fuck, leaking...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Get out of here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Something was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The same thing was happening in most of the cells.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In one room, the person hadn&#x2019;t been able to reach the toilet and there was a disgusting smell in the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Number 411! Ya, hey!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The new guard was dismayed as there was no reaction from the prisoner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he opened the door with a key and went inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Number 411 had collapsed on the bed like he was dead.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bed was messed up with vomit and feces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stomach pains... Nausea, diarrhea... This is food poisoning!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, it seemed to be affecting many prisoners.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We need to report this to the warden!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The new guard realized that he had to tell the warden before the situation became serious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After an hour went by, the warden and guards gathered for an emergency meeting.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Food poisoning?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden&#x2019;s face distorted as he heard the report of the prison guards.</span></p><p><span style="">A few days ago, the logistics line had broken down, but there was still one ship that could be operated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also food ingredients piled up in the warehouse.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, one of the remaining bastions, the food warehouse, had bacteria growing that was causing food poisoning.</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, he couldn&#x2019;t panic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a week, he could harvest the money from the farms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If outsiders entered here, then he would have to pull them all out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to avoid that no matter what.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There aren&#x2019;t good crops these days so the output is decreasing... If we fail to properly harvest it at this time...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Just imagining it was terrible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The warden issued instructions to the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go to the warehouse and use the food poisoning bacteria detector! We purchased it just for occasions like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep! I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Some of the guards hurriedly rushed out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In such a situation, it would take a long time to do a full investigation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I need to mobilize the remaining supply ship as soon as possible. Damn. In addition, the budget...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, one of the prison&#x2019;s secretaries raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why?!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim... I was going to tell you today, but the engine for the remaining supply ship is broken.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What the?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden felt dizzy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would take a week for the repairs on the other ship to finish.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if he asked for support from the outside then he risked exposing his gardens.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. I need to hope that a lot of ingredients are safe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden sat in his chair and waited for the investigation people to come back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Bad news constantly came in.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim! There is no more room in the infirmary. There are more than 50 patients.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are even guards who are patients. The entire prison is paralyzed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Warden-nim...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ward..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His last hope was that the food poisoning bacteria hadn&#x2019;t spread too much.</span></p><p><span style="">One hour passed by.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eventually, the team that went to investigate the food ingredients returned.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, not all of the food supply was contaminated with the bacteria.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-Really? I&#x2019;m glad... How much is still fine?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;30... No, it is around 20%. There isn&#x2019;t enough for the guards to eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The warden collapsed onto his chair as he became aware of the desperate situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the worst.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should I do...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t get a clear answer.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk went to the store selling food.</span></p><p><span style="">They were selling simple food like sausages, canned tuna, and smoked chicken legs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would like to buy all of it, but it would be considered suspicious if he did so.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he bought only enough to fit into a box of sweets.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What type of dinner are you having?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The food store worker asked with a curious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk just smiled instead of answering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was enough for him to eat alone for a week.</span></p><p><span style="">The guards were distracted by the food poisoning epidemic inside the prison.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They wouldn&#x2019;t even realize if I tried to escape right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered with a sausage in his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ever since he put the bacteria on the food, he hadn&#x2019;t eaten anything other than instant food.</span></p><p><span style="">Once he returned to his cell, Yoo Cheol-ho was groaning on the bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been sitting on the toilet all night but it seemed like it was blocked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuook...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho grabbed his belly and groaned. There were so many patients in the infirmary that he had to stay in his cell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He received a few treatment pills and an IV.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to prevent dehydration, it was necessary to continue taking electrolytic water, which was simply salt water.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Water, give me water.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and grabbed bucket on the table next to Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His cellmate ended up suffering from his work.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want me to feed you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...I&#x2019;ll take care of it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho took the bucket of water with trembling hands and gulped it down.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, more of it flowed down his chin than into his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn... Those scum should cook the food properly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho grunted from his spot on the bed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk hid his food in between the sheets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he ate one more sausage as he watched the guards walking around.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Once a person had food poisoning, they had to drink plenty of water to prevent symptoms of dehydration.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they took antibiotics to treat the bacterial poisoning, they could be cured within a few days.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Make sure to take the antibiotics 30 minutes after eating. Drink at least two liters of water a day for three days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The patients in the infirmary finished their treatment and started returning to their rooms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like the food poisoning incident was finished.</span></p><p><span style="">But the main problem was in the dining room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">White rice porridge was on the menu twice in a row, which wasn&#x2019;t even enough to fill their stomachs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of the inmates spoke after receiving the food from the worker,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is this? Are we in Auschwitz? Why are we eating something like this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The worker responsible for the food distribution replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the warden&#x2019;s command. Since everybody became sick from the food poisoning, he ordered porridge to be served. Just eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fuck, did I get food poisoning?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A watching guard came running over and grabbed the inmate&#x2019;s collar.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Get away right now, Number 974! Didn&#x2019;t I say you would be put in solitary confinement if you fought one more time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Number 974 said to the guard,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, is this too much? Still, I&#x2019;m not eating this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eat the meal. It is a precious food made from the taxes of the people, so eat it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What expression is this bastard making?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nothing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Number 974 smiled before heading to his seat with his tray.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, Number 974 wasn&#x2019;t the only one who complained.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no need to use a spoon; they just tilted their plates and poured it into their mouths.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This isn&#x2019;t enough. Damn, I&#x2019;m going to get some chicken legs from the store.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The inmates started flocking towards the store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it cost money, they couldn&#x2019;t handle just one bowl of porridge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Number 974 joined the long line to the store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was able to enter the store just as lunchtime was over.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? It is all gone!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The food that could be eaten had disappeared like locusts had passed by.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were only a few condiments left, such as sesame oil and hot pepper paste.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Number 974 asked the worker responsible for the store.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When will more goods be coming in?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t know. At least a week.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy. Isn&#x2019;t there anything to put out this fire?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The worker pulled out a link of sausage and a chicken leg hidden in a corner of the counter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give this to you. Don&apos;t tell anybody else.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand. I will eat it well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Number 974 went outside thinking that he had become friends with the worker.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a day or two, this rush would end.</span></p><p><span style="">He laughed at the thought.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Another day passed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the meals didn&#x2019;t return to normal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The inmates were eating things like anpan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, most of them grabbed their bellies and groaned from hunger.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is this? Everything is crazy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I heard from someone that the guards are eating very well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. What are we?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They were trapped in a prison and there was no place to relieve their accumulated stress.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After a few days of the food crisis, their anger was reaching a boiling point.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, do I smell sausage from your body?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What nonsense are you saying?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, I&#x2019;m sure of it. Did you eat secretly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The prisoners&#x2019; feelings became more intense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Little by little, they became harder for the guards to deal with.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk watched from a corner and realized that it was almost time for the final stages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prisoners would now become bombs that would explode.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they couldn&#x2019;t do anything against armed guards.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I need a hot explosion for the prison war, and it can only be done by him.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked around for a certain person&#x2019;s face and sat in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The meal is delicious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is nice to eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung smiled as he faced Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were no emotions in his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt as if he had transcended all things in this world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Bomber Kim Tae-sung.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly said the other person&#x2019;s nickname.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s hands trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You know my nickname.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know very well.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;My identity is classified as first class confidential.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Not many people knew that Kim Tae-sung was confined here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a man who could make a bomb that would blow up a building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a chance he could be taken into a criminal organization, which could lead to terrorism.</span></p><p><span style="">The man who smashed the Taesung Group with only one bomb stared at Tae-hyuk with empty eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll get straight to the point. Kim Tae-sung, I want you to do something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The God of Crime and the Bomber had a reunion.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
