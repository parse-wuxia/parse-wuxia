<p><span style="">Chapter 52 - Death Circus #3 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Three hours had passed since the Death Circus started.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young frowned as he watched the progress on the monitors.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t like it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is a stage that is lacking in beauty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was no drama, nor was there a stunning victory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Usually, at least three times the amount of the current scenes would emerge.</span></p><p><span style="">All of this was due to that Choi Sung-yeol brat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young had prepared the best stage and produced a variety of situations that would pull out human instincts and selfishness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Choi Sung-yeol&#x2019;s role was to gather the participants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a divided structure that took full advantage of both people&#x2019;s skills.</span></p><p><span style="">He usually put a wolf among 29 general participants before opening the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the number of regular participants was exceptionally low this time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, only 25 people were gathered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Two people entered shortly after it opened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he was forced to call five wolves in.</span></p><p><span style="">The result was this: nine people had already died, but none of the proper scenes came out.</span></p><p><span style="">In particular, Cha Soo-hyun was the worst.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He cheated the opponent with his words and took their money away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t fun or impressive.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young wanted to see participants challenging the attractions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Betraying those who believed in them to take the money away, or people risking their lives on a last gamble for revenge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young wanted such drama.</span></p><p><span style="">Humans were filled with desires, selfishness, and greed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These emotions were the best seasonings for the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Cha Soo-hyun was left alone, then he would completely ruin this stage.</span></p><p><span style="">This had to stop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young pulled out his phone to deal with Cha Soo-hyun.</span></p><p><span style="">For him, sheep and wolves were both consumables.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The most important thing was to create the best stage, and it was necessary to get rid of Cha Soo-hyun in order for that to happen.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young suddenly got a good idea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Choi Sung-yeol didn&#x2019;t act properly, then Kim Joon-young would recruit the participants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the people prepared by Choi Sung-yeol were those on the verge of ruin due to their debts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a bitter taste and they lacked freshness.</span></p><p><span style="">What if he lied to a young woman on the street about becoming a model in order to make her follow him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe he could abduct a child and force their parents to participate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That way, a drama that was several times better than the current one would be born.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young decided to try it next time.</span></p><p><span style="">Then the phone was connected.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s me. Replace a player. Take Cha Soo-hyun out right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">S-Sorry but he has already been sent off...</span></i></p><p><span style="">A thick vein throbbed on Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who told you to send him off?! This stage is mine. Without my permission...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t me. He was forcibly ejected by another player.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He was deceived by a man called Lee Cheol-su and handed over all of his money to the other party.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s face distorted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was really unexpected, but Kim Joon-young decided to think of this as another opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahat! That&#x2019;s right. Isn&#x2019;t a situation like this fun? Indeed, he was a black sheep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was slang for a criminal hiding amongst the sheep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Joon-young&#x2019;s thoughts started to move rapidly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to take advantage of this situation and turn it into a great drama.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the only way to save the stage that had been ruined.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Deliver a message to all the wolves on stage right now. I will give a special bonus to those who hunt the black sheep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes!</span></i> <i><span style="">I understand.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Cha Soo-hyun was the smallest of the wolves, since all he could do was move his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Joon-young started laughing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How long could the black sheep last against the wolves, armed with solid teeth and sharp claws?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t stand the anticipation.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Hunt the black sheep.</span></p><p><span style="">This instruction was issued to the wolves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A special bonus would be given to the one who was successful.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A huge 100 million won bounty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was 50% of the sum that they needed to earn.</span></p><p><span style="">The wolves&#x2019; eyes flashed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although they were experts in various fields, this was the Death Circus, a place where they never knew what would happen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There wasn&#x2019;t a 100% guarantee that they would be safe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, they decided to participate for the sake of making money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, there were some wolves who liked the taste of sheep, but they were few in number.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I will get 100 million by catching Lee Cheol-su!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">That thought popped into the heads of all the wolves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If four wolves converged on the black sheep at the same time, then he could be easily eliminated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, they had no intention of doing that.</span></p><p><span style="">The Producer would be angry that the spectacle that he created had been suppressed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything they did was in the name of the entertainment of the guests.</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining four wolves prepared to catch the black sheep.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There were monitors of various sizes in the ballroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could see images from hundreds of cameras.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they chose a place that they wanted to watch, then it would be displayed.</span></p><p><span style="">The guests could pick the participant that suited their tastes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now, the same person was showing on every monitor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All the masked people wanted to see him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, they all assembled at the biggest monitor to watch the showdown between the black sheep and a wolf in Bluff Poker.</span></p><p><span style="">The opera mask said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For those of you who just arrived, I will briefly explain the situation. The sheep on the screen has just eaten a wolf. His name is Lee Cheol-su.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The masked people were dismayed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The younger one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It seems like he hasn&#x2019;t even gone to the army yet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Looking at those clothes, he looks like a good-for-nothing neighbourhood punk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did he really eat a wolf?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The opera mask clapped, forcing everyone else to fall silent.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The game if Bluff Poker, everybody&apos;s favorite game. Lee Cheol-su has 180 million right now. Let&#x2019;s see, the wolf... He has 90 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Isn&#x2019;t that close to 200 million? What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The opera mask&#x2019;s eyes narrowed at the question from another masked person.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was surprised at first as well. Such an amount means that he will have an overwhelming lead over the wolf. However, that isn&#x2019;t the case. In fact, the game hasn&#x2019;t even started yet. This is the result of taking that woman and Cha Soo-hyun&#x2019;s money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Those who had questions were convinced and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He looks like a punk, but it is kind of good? By default, he has the advantage in Bluff Poker.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;With this amount, then he might win again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The opera mask refuted the people talking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you think the Producer wouldn&#x2019;t take action?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Opera mask manipulated the monitor to see the wolves.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were two men in their 30s.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The masked people shouted as they remembered their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Park Tae-soo and Park Dae-soo brothers!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The brother wolves have gathered to catch the sheep.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This is a jackpot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The masked people&#xA0;shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="">The Tae-soo and Dae-soo brothers were famous card sharks known for working together.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Each brother has 90 million. They always go against another person and win. It might be the same in this situation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo was known for his poker face that never lost its calm, no matter the circumstances, while Dae-soo had a keen eye for reading the opponent&#x2019;s cards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, dexterity was a basic thing for both of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the two of them combined their strengths, they became a team that no other card shark could compete with.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a confrontation between the sheep who took Cha Soo-hyun&#x2019;s money and the gambling brothers.</span></p><p><span style="">A huge battle was about to happen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opera mask manipulated the monitor towards the viewpoint of the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The game seems to be started straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A time limit existed in the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, all the games were fast paced.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Bluff Poker needed a dealer so a man in a black suit came and started to mix the cards.</span></p><p><span style="">It was two sets from 1-10.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was a total of 10 games.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The number of cards meant it was relatively easy to count the cards.</span></p><p><span style="">It was Tae-soo who participated in the match.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The lion mask sat on a chair and stared at the screen in front of him as he spoke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opera mask next to him was in charge of commentary.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This match is important, so the brother with the good poker face emerged before the other one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The basic bet is 10 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. Isn&#x2019;t it usually one million?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They know that the opponent has a lot of money. It&#x2019;s an action designed to end this quickly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The opera mask laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So if they run out of money, they will need to bet 100ml of blood. One litre of blood might be pulled out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! I am looking forward to it. It will be a really exciting match.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The card was placed in front of Cheol-su and Tae-soo.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two men put the card on their forehead.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could see the opponent&#x2019;s card but not their own.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Betting or withdrawing would now begin.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Cheol-su has a 3 of spades, and Tae-soo has an 8 of clubs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cheol-su bet 10 million, even though his opponent&#x2019;s card was quite high.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-soo maintained his poker face and followed the call.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Tae-soo won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In a time that was shorter than a minute, Tae-soo had won 20 million.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Indeed, a professional gambler. He figured out his opponent&#x2019;s playing style, and is playing calmly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The next game immediately started.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The masked people sighed as they saw the cards on both foreheads.</span></p><p><span style="">Cheol-su had a 10 of spades.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The strongest card.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would win no matter what card the opponent had.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this was Bluff Poker.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Only the opponent could see the card.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god... Tae-soo pulled a 9 of clubs. I think this game is over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The situation was very fun.</span></p><p><span style="">And 9 of clubs and a 10 of spades were going against each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-soo saw the opponent&#x2019;s 10 of spades and had to decide if he would bluff or forfeit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he chose to bluff, then he would have to risk a high bet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the case of Cheol-su, he might withdraw when seeing that the opponent had a 9 of clubs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The game depended on whether Tae-soo bluffed or forfeited.</span></p><p><span style="">Indian Poker, the base of Bluff Poker, had a special rule.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Those who forfeited after drawing a 10 of spades would have to pay 10 times the base money.</span></p><p><span style="">The masked people listened to what Tae-soo would do.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Each participant had a miniature microphone built into their badges.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They could hear the conversation through it.</span></p><p><em><span style="">-I will bet 100 million.</span></em></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh! Bluff!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo had drastically raised the ante by 10 times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If this occurred, then the opponent had to hesitate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Cheol-su called, he might lose more than two thirds of his money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, Tae-soo&#x2019;s face hadn&#x2019;t changed the moment he made a bluff.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a person who could fool a lie detector.</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cheol-su will withdraw. The experience itself is too different.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. Eh? Cheol-su is saying something instead of withdrawing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The lion mask swallowed his saliva and listened.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-You are called Tae-soo?</span></i> <i><span style="">You aren&#x2019;t pretending to be a regular participant but aren&#x2019;t you actually a card shark?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo looked at Cheol-su with an expressionless face.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Have you heard of someone called Kim Shin-hyeong?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo finally opened his mouth.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I&#x2019;ve heard rumours.</span></i> <i><span style="">He is a pretty good gambler.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">-In fact, I&#x2019;ve fought against him.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hrmm.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You aren&#x2019;t curious about the result?</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I would have heard if you won.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Cheol-su...&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, Seo Tae-hyuk said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll tell you right away.</span></i> <i><span style="">I won perfectly.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I will call 100 million.</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">Wodangdang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">All the masked people watching the monitor stood up in shock.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The food in their bowls fell to the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a completely unexpected situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He bet a large sum of money, despite the opponent holding a 9 of clubs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A person would never agree to that call, unless they were confident they had picked a 10 of clubs.</span></p><p><span style="">But how...?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-soo got up and threw the chips that he was using as money at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">This bastard...</span></i> <i><span style="">You are cheating.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Let&#x2019;s move on.</span></i> <i><span style="">By the way, it is amazing.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will pick another 10.</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Shit.</span></i> <i><span style="">You&#x2019;re barking nonsense.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will definitely find out what trick you used.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The dealer handed out the cards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk also pulled a 10 this time.</span></p><p><span style="">The crowd cheered as they watched it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The ballroom had become a complete mess.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, they didn&#x2019;t realize that the butterfly mask, who informed them of Cheol-su&#x2019;s existence, had disappeared.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>[TL Note]&#xA0;</strong>For those who want to watch Bluff Poker (Indian Poker) in action, I&apos;ve included a link below.</p><p><a href="www.youtube.com">Bluff Poker</a></p><p>It is from a Korean variety show called the Genius, with the participants being Kim Gura, a famous Korean comedian and Hong Jin-ho, a former pro Starcraft player under the alias of&#xA0;<b>YellOw </b>and&#xA0;is famous for always coming second&#xA0;to BoxeR.</p><p>For those interested in watching the series, here is a <a href="www.youtube.com">youtube</a> link for the first season.
