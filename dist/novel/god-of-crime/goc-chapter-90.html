<p><span style="">Chapter 90 - Big Brother&#x2019;s Raid #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you enjoy seeing the people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do was as happy as he was when he was a child.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect so many people to come. I met some of the world&#x2019;s richest people today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly sighed,</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia plot to sell fakes of the Rubens painting had been smashed by Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he got Machine and left then it would be the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the remaining people here would be the target of the Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Director Kim Hyun-do. Not long after, the Red Mafia will come looking for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;R-Really? Don&#x2019;t worry Phantom. I absolutely won&#x2019;t say that you came here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shook his head, as Kim Hyun-do would be in danger if he did so.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they didn&#x2019;t know who the enemy was, then they would target the innocent people here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. Tell them that everything is Phantom&#x2019;s doing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So that you can be safe.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Heok...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do&#x2019;s eyes widened as he looked at Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A man who he simply thought of as a criminal was worrying about him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the mask, Phantom seemed to be gently smiling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he realized that Kim Hyun-do&#x2019;s heart was now his.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would be a villain if I discard my ally.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the future, S University would continue to do research into artificial body parts, Machina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could do this much lip service if it meant that he could keep having access to it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then can you please show my Machina as promised?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Understood!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do cried out in enthusiasm.</span></p><p><span style="">They arrived at the special exhibition hall of the museum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a place to release the results of projects from the laboratories.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was in order to get funds for their research.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The artificial body Machina is displayed in that area.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. You have been very useful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do wondered while Phantom would be interested in Machina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">By linking the nerves, humans could control the machine using their will.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it was listed as a new chapter in biomechanics, it was still in its infancy stage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The result was slightly better than normal.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It would be nice if he told me why he needed the Machina.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As he thought that, Tae-hyuk opened up,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You know that a while ago, I blew up some organ trafficking.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. There was a &#xA0;lot of excitement about Phantom&#x2019;s actions&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was some criticism but Kim Hyun-do didn&#x2019;t mention it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you will know that the children lost one of their body parts. I didn&#x2019;t want it to end with just rescuing them from hell. Humans can live due to hope.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do almost coughed.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Most people were enthusiastic about the fact that Phantom hit a criminal organization.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He also thought that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But Phantom was working to heal the wounds of those who suffered...&#xA0;</span><span style="">He even risked becoming enemies with the Red Mafia, a huge organization.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh... Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed at Kim Hyun-do&#x2019;s reaction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His original purpose for giving Soo-bin Machina was so that Kang-suk and Ha-ran could date.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he got the information that Park Jung-hwan and the mafia were related.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know what type of forces they had, but it was certain that he would need to confront them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He just pulled it forward a little bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;It is also good at introducing Phantom.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Without the masked criminal, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to face the mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk went to where Machina was displayed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The mannequin had a mechanical arm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He tested it with Spying to see if Forgery would work.</span></p><p><span style="">[A new attribute has been added to Forgery]</span></p><p><span style="">-Trace (Functional Copy) can now be used.</span></p><p><span style="">-It is possible to reproduce not only the appearance, but also the function.</span></p><p><span style="">-It is automatically acquired thanks to the skill proficiency of over 100%.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Automatically acquired?! Wow, what a complete benefit!&#x2019;</span></p><p>A significant amount of affinity points was required to add an attribute.&#xA0;<span style="">In order to do that, he needed to catch blacklist members faster so he could save more victims, but he obtained this for free.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, the ability was enormous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he had the materials then he would be able to build a spaceship.</span></p><p><span style="">[Forgery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Analyzing the specified artwork.</span></p><p><span style="">[Machine Body Machina ver 0.11]</span></p><p><span style="">-Electronic signals move the machine.</span></p><p><span style="">-It is a prototype and needs improvement.</span></p><p><span style="">-The detailed information is hidden because the rating is too low.</span></p><p><span style="">-Tools needed: Titanium alloy, stainless steel, CP1Z...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;W-Wait a minute...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stared blankly at the messages that started to rise on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[Insufficient driving motor materials.]</span></p><p><span style="">[Insufficient housing materials.]</span></p><p><span style="">......</span></p><p><span style="">30,000 parts were needed to make a car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Machina needed around 2,000 parts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Basically, there was a driving system that moved the arm and the housing that formed the outer surface.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, there was a central processing device that accepted and processed electrical signals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The container made of titanium alloy and stainless steel could be easily made.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the problem lied in the driving system and central processing device.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t at a level that can be made even if I have the materials!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do, watching from the sidelines, asked with a worried expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can you create it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. It is a very easy thing for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">He took exactly two weeks to collect all the materials.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuheok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes became moist as he saw the finished Machina.</span></p><p><span style="">How much trouble did he go through to make this happen?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though he had the crime skills, he couldn&#x2019;t create something from nothing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he needed to get all the parts individually.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Many of them were things that weren&#x2019;t sold on the market.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he ended up getting Big Mama&#x2019;s help.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an enormous amount of money, even through the black market.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But eventually, it was completed.</span></p><p><span style="">Thanks to the artificial skin, it really looked like a human arm from a distance.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is the Machina ver 0.12?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk called Kim Soo-bin from the warehouse he borrowed as a workshop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He naturally used the name Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Come over there?</span></i> <i><span style="">Are you going to do anything strange...?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is something I want to give you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Huh?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;If possible, please come alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin had now recovered enough to walk around without the help of others, but there was a lump attached to her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I thought I told you to come alone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Hye-mi was attached to Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was she nervous about meeting a criminal who turned South Korea upside down?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her hands were trembling.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unni&#x2019;s body is uncomfortable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I understand. It can&#x2019;t be helped if you are her guardian.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk patted Song Hye-mi&#x2019;s head before turning on the lights of the warehouse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? You are a surprisingly good person...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Hye-mi looked at Phantom&#x2019;s back with a blank expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had come prepared to defend her sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, his reaction was unexpectedly tender.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She thought he would be a demon-like person from hell...</span></p><p><span style="">There was a mannequin inside the warehouse.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t seem like you are planning a fashion show. What&#x2019;s with the mannequin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the smartphone that contained the Machina app and activated the stored motion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the mannequin&#x2019;s arm started moving.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What the?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Machina unbuttoned its clothes, tied a shoelace, and poured water into a cup.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were actions that were hard to do with one hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Tears dripped from Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s eyes as she realized what it meant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This is a gift...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took Machina off the mannequin and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. This will be your arm from now on.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, it was impossible to connect the nerves and move them freely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The movements had to be registered in advance on the smartphone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, just that alone would be a tremendous help.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From now on, this is going to be my arm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin gently patted the Machina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was the distinctive coldness of metal, but it was strangely warm.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I didn&#x2019;t say it was for free.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Surely he didn&#x2019;t want money?</span></p><p><span style="">Song Hye-mi exclaimed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-We don&#x2019;t have money!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu... I&apos;m sorry but there is something else more important.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Hye-mi&#x2019;s face turned bright red.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like there was a strange misunderstanding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin had taken off her outerwear so that the Machina could be installed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was obviously embarrassing to be standing in her underwear in front of a man.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he didn&#x2019;t have the slightest thoughts about that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What I want is data. The Machina will continue to develop in the future, so I will test every version with Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s body.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin laughed as she sat down on the chair prepared by Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;It would be nice if you were a little honest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The work of attaching the Machina was over.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was originally designed so that it could move freely through willpower without any other aids.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But a significant amount of time was required for it to develop into that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, Tae-hyuk would be eating popcorn and watching the research.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Be patient even if it hurts a little bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Machine was firmly attached to the cut surface of the body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the pain came from the healed flesh being torn again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes, this is nothing. I had my arm cut off without anesthesia, after all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had checked Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s size in advance so Machina fit her body perfectly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Soo-bin realized this and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;When did you examine my body?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t tell her that when she was at his house a while ago, he fed her sleeping pills and measured her size.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can tell just by looking.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin gazed at the masked Phantom suspiciously, but she couldn&#x2019;t see what expression the person inside was making.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is how it moves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk installed the Machina app on Soo-bin&#x2019;s smartphone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were 10,000 movements required in real life installed.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kiririk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was the sound of gears turning and Machina, Kim Soo-bin&#x2019;s right arm moved.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now I have to oil the arm every morning.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I made a manual for it so please read it carefully. In particular, you should always pay attention to warmth. If you go outside without any equipment in winter then it might become icy and stop working.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you can go back. I will send you a message if I need to contact you in the future.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi, who was hiding behind Soo-bin, stuck her head out and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I want to say something to Phantom. Thank you for saving Unni...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? I&apos;m sorry but I didn&#x2019;t hear it well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hye-mi was embarrassed and hid behind Soo-bin again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The scars inflicted by the organ trafficking incident would never disappear.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kim Soo-bin now had a new arm, and would be able to hold Hye-mi&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the two people leaving with a small smile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like the Doll Play incident was completely finished now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom! Sorry but could you open this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin asked as she got to the locked warehouse door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Just wait. I&#x2019;ll open it soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. I can open it. I want to test the power of the arm that Phantom gave me!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin manipulated Machina so it would open the shutter.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like she thought that the shutters were just down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Wait a minute! There is a lock...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Tae-hyuk cried out but it was too late..</span></p><p><i><span style="">Crunch!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Machina completely ruined the iron shutters and the lock.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wanted her to live a strong life, but it seemed to be a bit too strong.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">A new stewardess on a plane departing from China muttered as she watched the first class passengers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He looks like a movie star... &quot;What does Unni think?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The senior stewardess next to her replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Unbelievably handsome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think he has a lot of money. The clothes he is wearing are all brand names.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Furthermore, he is in his mid-30s...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The stewardess spent most of her days on a plane.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a result, she couldn&#x2019;t go on blind dates once she was at a marriageable age.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, she used to actively dash at young men in the business seats.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the customer in front of her was sitting in the first class seats.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In business class, there were many people who had to go on business trips quickly, but there was no room in economy.&#xA0;But&#xA0;</span><span style="">first class was different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If someone wasn&#x2019;t born with a gold spoon, it would be hard for them to buy it easily since it cost a large amount of money.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Business is bad right now so he is the only one in first class... Isn&#x2019;t this a big hit?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dom Perignon 2004? Take the whole bottle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the best champagne served only to first class guests.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;U-Unni. Perhaps...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am definitely serving him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How petty! I saw him first!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am turning 30 next year. There is an urgent fire.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hiing... I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The senior stewardess fixed her makeup in the hand mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then armed with her best smile, she headed to the first class customer.</span></p><p><span style="">After five minutes, the senior stewardess returned with a face full of smiles.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should I do? Too amazing. He is a complete gentleman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you get his number?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hah! I got his business card.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The senior stewardess proudly extended a black card.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&apos;s see... Is he a second generation chaebol? Or an actor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe he is both!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The business card contained one word in Chinese and a phone number.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Big Brother?&#x201D; (Chinese)</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Hyung-nim?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The stewardesses panicked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was nothing that stated the person&#x2019;s identity. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I still want to contact him. The customer bought a one-way ticket. He is obviously going to spend a long time in South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unni, please ask if he has any friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While the stewardesses were gossiping, he was drinking his glass.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x201C;Um... Good... It is a good drink.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother smelled the champagne that the stewardess had brought and opened his briefcase and looked at the profile of the target.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom. There is also a strange person in South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother, the best killer from the Triads, arrived in Korea.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I should meet Shin Se-ho from ABS Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother laughed and poured the champagne down his throat.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
