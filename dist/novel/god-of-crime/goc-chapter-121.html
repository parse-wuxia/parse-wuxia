<p><span style="">Chapter 121 - Divergent #1</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&quot;It has been one month. You made sure to keep the promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Kang-suk as they rode the boat leaving Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He seemed deep in thought and showed no reaction to Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The reply came from a man in a trench coat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom? No, should I call you Kim Cheol-su? The promise compensation will be guaranteed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. I hope something like last time isn&#x2019;t planned.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The expression and tone of words was so creepy that Joo Hyun-ho couldn&#x2019;t help gulping.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That face was a fake that was created.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it like the special makeup used to shoot movies?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would know clearly if he touched it, but unfortunately he didn&#x2019;t have that courage.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho smiled and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s not like you will be caught if that happens again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gave a meaningful smile instead of answering.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Hyun-ho felt regret.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a specialist in terms of identifying the criminal&#x2019;s feelings and analyzing them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t show it, but he was very proud of that fact.</span></p><p><span style="">But Kim Cheol-su...&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, he couldn&#x2019;t tell anything about Phantom despite questioning him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this wasn&#x2019;t enough to make Hyun-ho give up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom, whom he wanted to meet so much, was within a touching distance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to at least find out what midnight snack Phantom liked to eat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, do you know Shin Chang-ho?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The name is famous, so I&#x2019;ve heard it a few times. But is the commissioner healthy these days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He has a pollen allergy so it is a little tough... Hup.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho realized that he made a mistake while talking about the police commissioner&#x2019;s recent problem.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Conversely, he was the one being interrogated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was a rudimentary mistake that showed the other person wasn&#x2019;t a beginner. Hyun-ho&#x2019;s eyes trembled.</span></p><p><span style="">As Hyun-ho panicked, Tae-hyuk gazed at the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror floating in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Isn&#x2019;t this a completely fraudulent skill?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He rolled his eyes and gazed at the Demon Revealing Mirror again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a detailed description of the abilities and current psychological state of Joo Hyun-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">[No... It seems like the commissioner&#x2019;s secret mission is a bust...]</span></p><p><span style="">This was the ability of the [Hawk Eyes] attribute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk took advantage of it so that Hyun-ho would make mistakes that he wouldn&#x2019;t normally make.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t been possible to use it until now because he needed 10 affinity points to acquire.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he gained those missing points with the end of the prison war.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He guessed it was because he saved Park Sung-yul, who Shin Chang-ho was supposed to kill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;But when I think about it, two points were added.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He only got eight points for dealing with the Triads killer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he got two points for saving Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s life.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He thought that he got affinity points by saving the lives of people who were destined to die.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But the first one is too low, while the second incident gave too many points.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Did Big Brother only kill eight more people in the future?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t make sense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was still some uncertainty regarding the affinity points that strengthened crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyway, the characteristics of &#x2018;Hawk Eyes&#x2019;... This is the full jackpot!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">If he activated it, he could grasp the state of the opponent, almost like mind-reading.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the eyes of Hyun-ho, who didn&#x2019;t know about the crime skills, Phantom literally seemed like a monster.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk, who was quietly sitting beside Hyun-ho, opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, I was able to finish the Park Sung-yul case due to Kim Cheol-su. Thank you very much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was true that they solved the crime with the help of a criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even though he solved a tough case, Cho Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t seem pleased.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no need for thanks. I am getting paid for this after all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If it wasn&apos;t for your help, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been so easy to find the identity of the victims.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The image of the landlord after they found her daughter popped up in Kang-suk&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now Park Sung-yul would pay for his sins.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of it was due to Phantom&#x2019;s help.</span></p><p><span style="">As Kang-suk made a subtle facial expression, Joo Hyun-ho suddenly interrupted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, the investigation headquarters is having a get together next week. Kim Cheol-su, why don&#x2019;t you come? You were also crucial in solving this case. Furthermore, it will be very entertaining if you join...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk applied a headlock to the smiling Hyun-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a bit much to recommend Phantom attend a party with cops who were trying to catch him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. A dinner party. Not bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you see? Phantom thinks it is a good idea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Unfortunately, it will become a crime if I attend, so I have to politely refuse.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;O-Of course... Keok! S-Sunbae! I really will die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! Cheol-su. Forget about this idiot&#x2019;s words.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unfortunately, Kang-suk and Hyun-ho didn&#x2019;t correctly interpret Phantom&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom literally meant those words, since it was illegal for a minor to attend a drinking party.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Time passed by like the wind, and it had already been a week since Tae-hyuk returned from Blue Dragon Prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He lied that he was studying abroad for one month, so there were no problems at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Forgery meant that he could come up with the necessary documents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wondered about what had happened while he was away, since he gave some instructions to Kang Han-seong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They did better than he thought.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though Tae-hyuk had the crime skills, he was only one person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could cover that disadvantage with them and the Bomber&#xA0;to some extent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll have to use it often in the future. Are these clothes enough?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled at his appearance in the mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had returned to his original appearance after looking like Kim Cheol-su for one month.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the outfit he was wearing was slightly different.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was wearing a dark blue suit instead of his normal skinny jeans and leather jacket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Every year in spring, the three siblings would participate in a family event, and he was currently dressed up for it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk! Are you ready?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s voice was heard outside his door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk flicked back his long bangs and exited.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran and Tae-min, who were ready to attend the event, were waiting at the front door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-min pouted and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What man takes longer to get ready than a woman? Detective Cho Kang-suk is waiting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed at his brother&#x2019;s reaction, whom he hadn&#x2019;t seen in a long time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the feeling that Tae-hyuk had returned to where he should be.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have to say thank you to Kang-suk for driving us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hah! Ah right, did you remember to bring the barley tea for Detective-nim?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! I nearly forgot! It is in the fridge. Can you take it out for me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he saw Ha-ran and Tae-min treating Kang-suk like family, Tae-hyuk realized that many things had changed in the past month.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk grabbed the bag on the floor and walked outside.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk was sitting in the driver&#x2019;s seat of a shining new car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The black sunglasses and white gloves made him look like a chauffeur.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? Kang-suk hyung. When did you get a car?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Just recently. It is because I was sleeping at the office every day after missing the last train. I weighed the pros and cons and bought it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aye, isn&#x2019;t it for a different reason?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Really!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t ask anymore questions, although it seemed like Kang-suk bought it to go on dates with Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk put his bag in the trunk and sat in the back seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran carefully climbed into the front passenger seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kang-suk, thank you for doing this favor today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-min instantly started to question Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective-nim! You solved another case? It appeared on the news. You look very good on screen!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk laughed and started the car.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Then don&#x2019;t forget your seat belts. We are departing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk drove the car in the warm sunshine.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">After an hour, the party was able to arrive at their destination.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the left the city and arrived at a wooded place, the air was completely different.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran spoke cautiously from her seat next to Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have been very busy for a while... Thank you for taking us on such a long drive during your break.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk smiled gently and replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is nothing. I wanted to come with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took his bag from the trunk and headed for the familiar place that he visited every year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a city run tomb where the ashes of the dead were kept.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk headed to the place where his parents&#x2019; remains were.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t difficult to find the familiar names.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a good location, not too high or too low.</span></p><p><span style="">[Seo Dae-han, Nam Ji-soo&#x2019;s Tomb]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a framed picture and placed it in front of the urns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people had been returning from the same workplace when they got into an accident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He remembered Ha-ran&#x2019;s face when his parents were first brought here.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You will be together for the rest of eternity...</span></i> <i><span style="">After you die, stay on the royal floor.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tears had flowed from Ha-ran&#x2019;s eyes as she said this.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered quietly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I will protect Noona and Tae-min no matter what. And...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? I&#x2019;ve already finished the preparations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sorry Tae-hyuk! Noona will do the rest!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The rest of the group that arrived late started bustling around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They spread a mat on the floor and placed the prepared food on it.</span></p><p><span style="">Every year, on this day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the day to visit their deceased parents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The family gathered together and had a good time sharing stories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kang-suk. Please try some fruit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, I&#x2019;m sorry. I need to do something first. I will eat the fruit later.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk, who had been watching the family talking, got up from his seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His black suit and sunglasses gave him a daunting appearance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he had a look of determination.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk stopped in front of the urns and slowly opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Mother-nim, Father-nim. Nice to meet you. I am Cho Kang-suk and I work as a detective at Gangdong Police Station. Although I don&#x2019;t have anything else, I am confident that I can support Seo Ha-ran.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s face turned red as she watched from the side.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Omo, Kang-suk is really...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk slowly bowed to Seo Ha-ran&#x2019;s parents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he declared with all his will.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will surely make Seo Ha-ran happy. Father-nim, Mother-nim. Please give me your daughter!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Detective-nim?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The family showed various reactions to Kang-suk&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk slowly got up and pulled out something from his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sorry Ha-ran. This should be done in a place with a little more atmosphere. Nevertheless, I wanted to greet Ha-ran&#x2019;s parents.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gazed at Ha-ran with passionate eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he kneeled in front of Ha-ran and asked,&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a ring box on his palm.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I felt something the moment that I met you. Will you please marry me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran stood without saying anything while Tae-hyuk interrupted the two.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait a minute, Kang-suk hyung. You shouldn&#x2019;t do this yet. I wish you would have consulted me on such an important matter. How can you even propose this way? You should at least rent a five star lounge and do a romantic event... Ah! I don&apos;t know! Noona! Erase this day from your head. You will meet again next week. In the meantime, I will surely educate...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran, who was standing quietly for a while, suddenly threw herself into Kang-suk&#x2019;s arms.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! I will!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mind, he had the perfect proposal planned for Cho Kang-suk and Seo Ha-ran, yet Kang-suk had destroyed it all at once.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh... If you accept... The precious proposal... My plan... Ah, ahhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk literally fell to the ground and moaned.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk placed the ring on Ha-ran&#x2019;s left ring finger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, the two people promised to marry.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk laughed excitedly and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, everybody must be hungry. Let&#x2019;s go eat meat! How about beef? Meat!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk rose from his seat with a sigh.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The situation was good for both parties so there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Tae-hyuk realized that his plan was a success.&#xA0;</span><span style="">With this, Kang-suk was now part of the family of three.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unlike the previous life filled with despair, he had changed their fates perfectly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s chest warmed, the Demon Revealing Mirror screen appeared in front of him.</span></p><p><span style=""><span><a id="footnoteref-4" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></span></span></p><p><span style="">[You can use the affinity points to enhance crime skills or activate hidden attributes.]</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What? Affinity points?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He had gained unexpected points from Kang-suk proposing to Ha-ran.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk gulped and started thinking about the affinity points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It don&#x2019;t get it simply if I saved someone who was destined to die. That explanation doesn&#x2019;t work with the four points I got now. This means...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he finally saw what the true condition was for acquiring affinity points.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...By changing fate, the crime skills become stronger.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The power to change fate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This was the hidden identity of the affinity points.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><div class="footnotes"><ol><li><span id="footnote-4">affinity points have been acquired.<a href="#footnoteref-4" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li></ol></div><p></p>
