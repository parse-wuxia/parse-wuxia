<p><span style="">Chapter 140 - Everybody Gather! #6</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? We can talk about the details later, but I think we should run away first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right! Then what good plan do you have?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out the paper that he had used to make the counterfeit documents.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will apply what I have done before.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As his hand passed over the sheet, something appeared on the blank white paper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time it was a map, rather than some documents.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I wrote it in advance with Forgery and then implemented it with Counterfeit. Then, like magic, a map containing the escape route is created.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho looked at the map and exclaimed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a detailed plan to escape the police once arriving at the port.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But Phantom, can&#x2019;t you easily escape by changing your appearance? Why this thing...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am fine alone, but both of you will need to disguise yourselves if you want to escape with me. Two prisoners have escaped from prison, but the jailbreak isn&#x2019;t over until you completely get away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thinking up to here...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho looked at Tae-hyuk with an impressed expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had forced Phantom to bring him along, yet Phantom was paying such careful attention to help him escape.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk beckoned and urged the two people to hurry.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As time passes, the encirclement is narrowing. We have to hurry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The criminals who escaped from Red Phoenix moved along the route on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s map.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first destination was a nearby container box.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These boxes could be rented for a week at a cost of 100,000 won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were used for various purposes, such as temporary warehouses or housing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dress appropriately as you like.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, there were various clothing like a department store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Both prisoners were still in their prison uniforms, while Tae-hyuk was dressed as a prison guard.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their clothing was too prominent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh? There is a mirror. Is this to look at the disguises?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think a wig and some glasses are good for changing my appearance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho, who wore a clean suit and had nearly combed hair, looked like a white-collar office worker.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung wore cargo pants, a plain shirt, and used some disguise items.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk wore a tuxedo used by chauffeurs of luxury cars.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now it is time to go to the safe house in a car that is parked nearby.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you prepare the car in advance? Can&#x2019;t you use your abilities to steal one?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you escape in a stolen vehicle, then you are more likely to be caught by the police. A perfectly washed car will allow you to escape without detection.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what about the safe house?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a shelter. Most people who escape don&#x2019;t have a place to stay, so they lurk around their homes or friends&#x2019; places, causing them to be caught. If you stay in this shelter, then you won&#x2019;t be caught for your whole lifetime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">The safe house depicted was a house in the quiet countryside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was good compared to the church that he was caught in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, he could avoid the police by changing his appearance and stealing a vehicle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But Yoo Cheol-ho didn&#x2019;t want to show all the skills that he had.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Then let&#x2019;s finish this play.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shelter... You also prepared for what would happen after escaping the prison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I made a promise that I would help you break out of prison.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho chuckled.</span></p><p><span style="">In order to fight the mafia, Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s bombs were needed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The police weren&#x2019;t stupid.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Kim Tae-sung accidentally got caught again, then it wouldn&#x2019;t be easy for him to escape next time.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;He is something precious that I should deal with very carefully. Except for him, of course.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And don&#x2019;t forget this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as he watched Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he was looking at an old relationship.</span></p><p><span style="">Yes, Yoo Cheol-ho was the start of everything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Catching Yoo Cheol-ho had started a lot of things, but now it was farewell.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Yoo Cheol-ho looked in the mirror, Tae-hyuk handcuffed his hand to a pole nearby.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;P-Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is far enough, Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-What are you doing?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The promise was clearly to help you escape from prison. I have now honored my promise, it and now it is time to separate. We shouldn&#x2019;t travel together.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But a true jailbreak is when the person gets away...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right; however, unlike the Bomber, you are now useless. I&#x2019;m not the type of person to carry around loose baggage. Then I will give you the last mission: be captured by the police. We will use that time to get away safely.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">T-Tricked!&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had trusted the other person completely!</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho cried out,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom...! If you leave me like this then I will tell the police the location of the safe house! Then you will never be saf...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah? That?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A wicked smile appeared on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He touched the map with one hand and something new appeared on it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you really think that I would show you the real thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuooock!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho shouted with a red face as he realized.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;P-Phantom! This isn&#x2019;t over! How dare you betray me? I will twist your neck no matter what! Aha, ahahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? But I am sorry. Once you go back to prison, it won&#x2019;t be so easy to escape this time. You will receive very good treatment inside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and pulled a tape recorder out of Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s suit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-This...obviously the voice of the warden is recorded...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is a lie. I wonder what is really recorded?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho got goosebumps.</span></p><p><span style="">He had carried it around all this time, but hadn&#x2019;t thought much of it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But there was something other than the warden&#x2019;s voice recorded on it?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The button was clicked and Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s voice flowed out.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">The warden ordered me to watch Kim Tae-sung.</span></i> <i><span style="">He promised to give me some conveniences in the prison in return.</span></i> <i><span style="">Haha!</span></i> <i><span style="">Of course I am a mole.</span></i> <i><span style="">But who cares about my petty dealings with the warden, ohuhu!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...N-No! T-That!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho, who knew very well how spies were treated in prison, screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I think it is time to go home. Please get along well with your friends.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk placed it back in Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s pocket and buttoned it up.</span></p><p><span style="">Now he couldn&#x2019;t get rid of the tape recorder as he was struggled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As both hands were tied to the pole, he had to listen to his voice coming from the tape recorder.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bye bye Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kwang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The door of the warehouse closed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The police would come here soon.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho bit his lip and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shit. If I knew this would happen, then I would&#x2019;ve eaten the grilled ribs.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">After leaving the warehouse, they walked a few minutes and arrived at the prepared car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a used car purchased through Big Mama, but Tae-hyuk deliberately didn&#x2019;t bring the car keys.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As he placed his hand on the front door and activated the skill, the door opened and the car turned on.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a reason to use the Vehicle Theft skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This way, he could apply the attributes that changed the appearance and boosted the speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It feels strange because I am stealing something I own. Before I know it, my right and left hands might automatically steal...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gestured and Kim Tae-sung got on the back seat.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I didn&apos;t think you would abandon him like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is an uninvited guest. Plus, didn&#x2019;t I say that I would help him escape from prison? I made sure to keep my promise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want you to keep your promise to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung escaped in order to get revenge on the group that killed his family.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He promised to make bombs in return for Phantom&#x2019;s help.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he drove along a quiet country road, breaking news appeared on the radio.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-...One of the prisoners who escaped from Red Phoenix Prison has been arrested by the police.</span></i> <i><span style="">The police are using all of their efforts to arrest the remaining one...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;He was captured safely. Once he returns, he will be greeted enthusiastically by his friends as well as the warden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After one hour, the downtown area of the city appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hideaway was a small officetel &#xA0;located between other buildings. (Officetel=<a href="en.wikipedia.org">Google Link</a>)</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung entered the room and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this a place with many people? I thought the hideout would be in a quiet rural village.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is actually more dangerous in the countryside.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The countryside has an open atmosphere. The individuals there know everything about each other. In that respect, an officetel or an apartment is safer. Even if a person dies next time, they can be left there for several months.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, I agree. Then I will be working here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You will make the bombs here.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The room was perfectly prepared for it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Even the most important ventilation system is set up. Often people only think about the materials and tools.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It will be inconvenient if someone wonders about the smell. There is no need to create too much. One a day is enough.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s eyes flashed as he checked the equipment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tell me if there is something missing and I will prepare it for you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let me ask you one thing: What are you going to do with my bombs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung had killed innocent people in the past, but that was for the sake of revenge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If Phantom&#x2019;s purpose was to kill civilians...</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom was wearing an opera mask made of plaster over his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung felt like the mask smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Right now, China&#x2019;s, Russia&#x2019;s, and Japan&#x2019;s mafias are all gathering in South Korea. This place will soon be their battleground, and I want to stop that. Of course, I don&#x2019;t want to be a hero of justice. One of them has what I want.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You will deal with all of them by yourself?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I won&#x2019;t be able to do it alone. That is why I am gathering criminals.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Tae-sung noticed that he was one of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk took off his shoes and entered the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like a university laboratory filled with various tools.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But this wasn&#x2019;t the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were home appliances and multimedia equipment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was enough food, someone would be able to stay here for several months.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk headed towards the Bomber&#x2019;s workshop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was something made of plaster on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kim Tae-sung followed behind Tae-hyuk and muttered as he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Opera mask...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the same as the mask that was on Phantom&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom picked it up and approached the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he placed it on the Bomber&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom opened his firmly closed mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2015;From now on, you are Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
