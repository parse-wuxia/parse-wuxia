<p><span style="">Chapter 31 - Ill-Fated Relationship from a Past Life #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was going home after he finished his shift as a security personnel when someone struck him from behind with a metal pipe, rendering him unconscious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he woke up, he was holding a bloody knife, and a bloody man, who had been stabbed dozens of times with a knife, was lying in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">There was no time to escape before the police came and arrested him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the time, Seo Tae-hyuk had a blood alcohol level of more than 0.1%.&#xA0;</span><span style="">According to a witness&#x2019;s statement, the two were arguing when, &#xA0;all of a sudden, Tae-hyuk pulled out a weapon from somewhere and stabbed him.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t have any memory of this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was trapped in prison with no time to grasp the situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything was done in a quick manner, as if things had been prepared in advance.</span></p><p><span style="">For reference, there were two oddities in the case.</span></p><p><span style="">Firstly, why had Park Jung-hwan passed by that area without any guards? </span><span style="">Secondly, why were five witnesses just watching the fight?</span></p><p><span style="">In the early days of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s trial, some of the media outlets paid attention to these facts. </span><span style="">However, it soon devolved into the process of turning Seo Tae-hyuk evil. They only focused on that, and he was treated like a sociopath.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, Tae-hyuk was in prison. </span><span style="">The media were unable to meet him and turned the arrow towards his family.</span></p><p><span style="">-What type of family could raise a son that would brutally kill someone that way?</span></p><p><span style="">-His parents passed away, and was raised by his older sister. Doesn&#x2019;t she feel even a little responsible for this?</span></p><p><span style="">-I heard that he was violent since he was a child. Did she happen to be hit by him or something?</span></p><p><span style="">A ruthless news coverage sprang up against Seo Tae-min and Seo Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">It became known to the public that both of them were Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s family members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why did Seo Ha-ran and Seo Tae-min receive such treatment?</span></p><p><span style="">The &#x2018;thing&#x2019; he met before receiving the death penalty said that Seo Ha-ran was fired from her job.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, would that really have been the end of it? </span><span style="">What else had happened?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt horrible just imagining it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took deep breaths to calm himself down.</span></p><p><span style="">It hadn&#x2019;t happened yet, and he had to make sure it didn&#x2019;t happen in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, he needed information on Park Jung-hwan. In order to do that, Big Mama&apos;s cooperation was needed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk opened the door to Big Mama&#x2019;s pawn shop and went inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo, Tae-hyuk came. Hung ~ those clothes fit you well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama laughed and praised Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s new outfit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hello. I came to receive the rest of the payment.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, I have prepared it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama smiled and pulled a box of vitamin drinks out of her safe.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I feel like it&#x2019;s a crime to give you money in this box. It used to be that money was given an apple box, but this is what everyone is doing these days. One box contains 50 million won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, then I&#x2019;ll check it right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to open the box to check the amount.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama was a criminal who dealt with information and stolen goods. </span><span style="">If she deceived someone regarding money then it would be a blow to her credibility. However, it would be good to make sure.</span></p><p><span style="">The box contained 10 bottles of vitamin drinks. It was exactly as written on the outside of the box.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk cried out angrily.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is supposed to be Shin Saimdang! Shin Saimdang! Don&#x2019;t be jealous just because she looks younger than you!&#x201D;&#xA0;(Shin Saimdang: the first woman to appear on a Korean banknote, the 50,000 won note)&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohoho! It&#x2019;s a joke, a gift. This is the real one.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama pulled out two different boxes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This time, it really did contain a lot of money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk carefully checked if the amount was correct. There were 20 bundles of 100 sheets, making an &#xA0;exact 100 million.</span></p><p><span style="">Now it was time to cut to the chase.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, is Big Mama in the information business?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How did you know? In fact, it is a new business that I started. By the way... the name Big Mama doesn&#x2019;t hold the dignity I&#x2019;m looking for. In the future, I might change it to something else.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I can&#x2019;t think of you as anything but Big Mama.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. Anyway, what did you want to know? The three sizes of your favourite girl?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although he was a bit curious, he wouldn&#x2019;t spend money just to know such a thing. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to find out everything about Park Jung-hwan.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I figured you would ask that. By the way, my information is a bit expensive, so will it be okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gazed at the box in front of him without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Pay a deposit of one million first. The investigation period is 10 days, and if I&#x2019;m successful then pay me another two million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sorry, I didn&#x2019;t quite hear that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This time it isn&#x2019;t a joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;E-Expensive!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was more than three times the price of other pieces of information.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was probably trying to take as much as she could because he currently had a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama said with a soft smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Politicians on the front lines have a rating above A grade. Furthermore, he is currently in retirement. This is a reasonable price.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuheom! Yes, I understand. Instead, please make sure that the information is accurate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will zoom in so close that I will know if he holds on to his buddy with his left hand or right hand when he pees.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t want to know anything like that, he didn&#x2019;t want to miss any little clues.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then we have a deal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for using my services.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Mama called out to Tae-hyuk as he was leaving.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, right. Tell me if you ever want to come back to work. You are always welcome.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much will you pay me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hmm, 6,500 won an hour?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed bitterly.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a little better than the minimum wage, but there were many things that he wanted to learn from her.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Anyway, I have no choice but to wait.&#x2019; </span></p><p><span style="">He would use Big Mama&#x2019;s power as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">For Tae-hyuk, who only had four skills, this was the best way.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk handed his report card to Ha-ran with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was second in the class, and seventh in the school.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran asked after seeing it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is this Tae-min&#x2019;s?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, it&apos;s mine.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran started to scrutinize his report card with a confused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">She screamed.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s name was definitely written on it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo! Omo!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran reflexively stroked Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did Noona say? I knew you could do it! Really well done!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s amazement didn&#x2019;t end there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, Noona. I have one thing to ask so please answer with the truth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Noona isn&#x2019;t stupid. In fact, aren&#x2019;t you good at studying? It is enough to go to the university that you wanted.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I saw the acceptance letter that Noona hid during the voice phishing case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That, I was just lucky...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. Just tell me the truth. Noona had to give up on your dream because of Tae-min and me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Yes. Sorry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you sorry Noona? I&#x2019;m the one who should be saying sorry!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk doesn&#x2019;t need to be sorry! I just did what I needed to do... So... Waaaah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran suddenly started to cry.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gently stroked his sister&#x2019;s back and gave her some tissue.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you did what you had to do, Noona. Please stop working at the factory now and prepare your luck. And... let&#x2019;s take the university entrance exam together next year.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran gazed at Tae-hyuk with red eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Huh? T-The living expenses...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will do it somehow. The school registration fees as well.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That will cost a lot of money...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The living expenses for a family of three and the school admission fees. If he included the university tuition, it was a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have a lot of money right now.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haven&#x2019;t you spent all the bounty money?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, he had saved quite a bit of that money.</span></p><p><span style="">He felt remorse for a moment, but that wasn&#x2019;t what mattered right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Not long ago, I met with the vice president of the Jinsung Group in private. He took me around his house, and in his house, there was a painting that I liked so much that he gave it to me as a gift. In fact, it was actually a very expensive painting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;R-Receiving such an expensive gift! Give it back right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. In fact...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk showed her the box filled with money.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already sold it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran held a hand to her head, as if she was dizzy.</span></p><p><span style="">The box was filled with 50,000 won bills.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The total seemed to be in the tens of millions. It was the first time she had seen such a large amount of money.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t this enough to live for a few years?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran said quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Go now and return the money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew that Ha-ran was overflowing with goodness but he hadn&#x2019;t expected this.</span></p><p><span style="">Should he have thought of another excuse?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Something like a passerby saving him. They gave him the lotto number or something like that.</span></p><p><span style="">But the water had already been spilled.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, 50 million won may be a big amount of money for us, but is it really such a big deal for those who already have a lot of money? Thus, he gave me this as a gift. Moreover, I don&#x2019;t think it is polite to return something received as a gift.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In that case, Tae-hyuk would become a villain.</span></p><p><span style="">He first had to convince Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke smoothly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When I think about the personality of the person who gave it to me, I think we should use it. Study hard and go to a good university.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Certainly, it is rude to return a gift.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s right. Can&#x2019;t we use this money? Let&#x2019;s study hard and go to university together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk patted Ha-ran&#x2019;s shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, Noona should put this in your treasure chest. That is the safest place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So, let&#x2019;s go to a private cram school this Saturday. A friend of mine gave me the information, and she recommended the best cram school.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A friend? Is it a man?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, it is a woman.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ha-ran looked at Tae-hyuk with a shocked face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The kid who had followed her around finally grew up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Write the resignation letter immediately. From now on, Noona is a student.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran&#x2019;s expression brightened the moment she heard those words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were her dream words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, yes. I understand. Tae-hyuk... Really, thank you...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief. Now, it would really start.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be different from his previous life, where everyone was unhappy. Ha-ran and Tae-min too. Everybody would be able to achieve what they wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was his only reward for those who believed in him until the end.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered under his breath, as if he was making a promise.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m going to slowly change it. The future... no, my destiny!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Everything seemed like a dream to Ha-ran. She was several times happier this time, compared to the time when they had just moved into the new house. </span></p><p><span style="">Abandoned&#x2026; No, she could achieve her dream that she had given up on.</span></p><p><span style="">Her brother, who she thought was a troublemaker, had reached the seventh rank in the school, and told her to go to university together.</span></p><p><span style="">She was so happy that she couldn&#x2019;t help but cry.</span></p><p><span style="">Besides&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t have to look at the face of the manager who harassed her anymore.</span><span style="">What would he look like when she resigned tomorrow? </span></p><p><span style="">She expected that she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to go to sleep.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran pinched herself to check if it wasn&#x2019;t a dream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah! &#x2026;It is real!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She pulled out the treasure chest and checked the box that Tae-hyuk gave her.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There really was 50 million won.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ha-ran became uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said that keeping it here was the safest place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, a thief entered the house and had taken Rosario just a few days ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Although it was recovered, the incident had left a big scar on Ha-ran&#x2019;s mentality.</span></p><p><span style="">As the head of the family, she had the responsibility to protect everyone, and she couldn&#x2019;t do that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If this money was stolen&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran was worried, and prepared countermeasures in her own way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes! This is it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran smiled happily.</span></p><p><span style="">This money was necessary for her family&#x2019;s dreams and happiness.</span></p><p><span style="">She had to protect it somehow. To do that, she was prepared to do anything.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
