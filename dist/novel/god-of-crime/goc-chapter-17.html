<p><span style="">Chapter 17: Having Too Much of a Good Thing #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">It was the anticipated day when the exam results would come out.</span></p><p><span style="">Understandably, everyone was interested in the rankings of An Eun-young and Park Sung-kwang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After entering the school, the two people had always occupied the first and second places.</span></p><p><span style="">Who would be ranked first in the whole school this time?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think that Sung-kwang will win this time. These days, his rankings have been very high.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But can he overcome the wall that is An Eun-young? On the last test, she got an average of 98 points. ...The god of studying. Totally.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But it seems that Eun-young didn&#x2019;t prepare much for the test because she was teaching Seo Tae-hyuk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, Class President is eternally....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Park Sung-kwang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...An Eun-young!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was a fiery argument in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! Be quiet! The results you&#x2019;ve been waiting for have come out!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The front door of the classroom had opened and Teacher Jung Nam-ho had entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a big smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Jung Nam-ho started to give out the report cards in the order of the attendance number.</span></p><p><span style="">People who got the desired result were cheerful. </span><span style="">Those who got lower than they had expected sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Park Sung-kwang.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s turn.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He was confident that he was first in the school, so he walked forward with a smiling face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the atmosphere was weird, and Teacher Jung Nam-ho had a concerned expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Is something going on at home?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang asked with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aiyah. We need to do something about this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang felt like something was unfortunate as he returned to his seat with the report card.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he cursed as he opened the envelope.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Shit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Seventh overall.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was a person who had only ever been first or second. It was a satisfactory achievement.</span></p><p><span style="">If there was a problem, it was that he had always been behind someone.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Wooduk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang grinded his teeth together.</span></p><p><span style="">There was only one reason for this outcome:</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That bitch had backstabbed him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had copied An Eun-young&#x2019;s answer sheet. So, it seemed like she had sacrificed her own grades.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young would be seventh place as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Park Sung-kwang glared at An Eun-young, thinking about how to get revenge.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young soon received her report card.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Teacher Jung Nam-ho&#x2019;s chest puffed up like he was proud.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;An Eun-young! The first in the school! You&#x2019;ve worked hard! Go home and rest!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young smiled gently and bowed toward Teacher Jung Nam-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;First in the school?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He had obviously copied An Eun-young&#x2019;s answer sheet exactly. So, why was there a different result...?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And there is someone else I have something to say to. Tae-hyuk! Come out!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk, who had been sitting quietly in his seat until then, walked forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Jung Nam-ho embraced Tae-hyuk enthusiastically.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was really surprised! Another first place student came from my class! Tae-hyuk! What did I say? I knew you could do it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-that is ridiculous!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Seo Tae-hyuk is first place?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lies!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The students fell into a panic at Teacher Jung Nam-ho&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They knew that he had been studying hard with Class President. Still, it was the first place in the school.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a gangster who was soon to be expelled.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, the problems came from the parts that Class President taught me. I was lucky.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey! Well done! Really well done! But what is with that face?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Jung Nam-ho pointed to the bandage stuck to Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, this? You will soon find out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was like someone had injured him.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Seo, Tae, Hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang rushed toward Tae-hyuk with a demonic expression.</span></p><p><span style="">He grabbed Seo Tae-hyuk by the collar and dragged him out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You guys! Hey! Park Sung-kwang!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Teacher Jung Nam-ho moved forward, but it happened so quickly that he couldn&#x2019;t stop Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang dragged Seo Tae-hyuk to the school rooftop.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know exactly what had happened.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">However, one thing was for certain&#x2014;that bastard Seo Tae-hyuk had a hand in it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How dare you fuck with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk cocked his head with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Denying it until the end! Dog scum. I don&#x2019;t know how you did it, but you changed my answer sheet to yours!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke while peering at the wristwatch on his right wrist.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You were sitting behind me when doing the test. Wouldn&#x2019;t you notice if I did anything weird?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It made a lot of sense.</span></p><p><span style="">Obviously, Seo Tae-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t done anything suspicious when he took the exam.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Wait. You clearly fought with the student who was collecting the papers. I thought you had just gone crazy from the stress. My answer sheet was taken at that time!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke like it was unfair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you see me lay a finger on the answer sheets?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No! It had to be then! Tell me! What did you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk once again looked at his watch to confirm the time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I really didn&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This dog scum. Do you think you will be safe if you do this? My father is a politician!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang was sincerely heated up. He was irritated that Seo Tae-hyuk was acting so calmly in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would use a group of gangsters under his father&#x2019;s influence. &#xA0;</span><span style="">It would ease his heart to aim them at Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well. Is it that time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang realized something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">Since earlier, Seo Tae-hyuk had seemed to be wasting time. He had also been checking the time with his wristwatch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Additionally, Seo Tae-hyuk had a bandage on his face. It seemed like someone had injured him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Park Sung-kwang never touched Seo Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">So, who did it...?</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk licked his lips and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, this cut on my face?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He peeled back the bandage to reveal a bruise like someone had beaten him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I had to concentrate on playing the role. Is this called method acting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Acting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, it will be starting soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s watch was pointed at exactly 9.30.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, something was broadcasted around the whole school.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Seo, Tae, Hyuk!</span></i> <i><span style="">You son of a bitch!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s angry voice was heard from the broadcast.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then there was a noise like someone was fighting.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Peok!</span></i></p><p><span style="">There were the sounds of someone being beaten.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I&#x2014;I won&#x2019;t cooperate with your cheating no matter how much you beat me up!</span></i></p><p><span style="">This time it was Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">The human imagination was great. They only heard a few voices and some sound effects, yet the scene appeared vividly in front of their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s fist slammed into Seo Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk certainly heard it this way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He muttered with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, Eun-young did it correctly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Broadcast? Why is it my voice? What the hell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang panicked. It was his voice and not someone else&#x2019;s that was being broadcasted.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I told you to change your answer sheet with mine.</span></i> <i><span style="">Are you resisting now?</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll kill you!</span></i></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">S-still.</span></i> <i><span style="">My grades have been low since doing this for you!</span></i> <i><span style="">Additionally, framing me for that beating...</span></i> <i><span style="">I can&#x2019;t take it anymore!</span></i></p><p><i><span style="">-Stupid bastard.</span></i> <i><span style="">I am the ruler of this school, yet you&#x2019;re rebelling against me?</span></i> <i><span style="">I will make this your memorial day!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang was stunned as he listened to the broadcast from the roof.</span></p><p><span style="">It detailed that he had changed his grades by intimidating Seo Tae-hyuk, who was very good at studying.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, he did something similar, but it wasn&#x2019;t with Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Additionally, he had tried to kick Tae-hyuk out of school by framing him for a fight.</span></p><p><span style="">Such contents were being broadcasted.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke with a face of admiration,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, this part! I did it, but it doesn&#x2019;t seem real. &#x2018;For the sake of justice, I can&#x2019;t endure your wickedness any longer!&#x2019; Wah... Don&#x2019;t I have a talent in acting?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang knew that the broadcast was being manipulated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how his voice had gotten on there, but that didn&#x2019;t matter.</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, he was a great villain who had threatened Seo Tae-hyuk to cover up his actions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He lost everything he had built in the school.</span></p><p><span style="">This had to stop.</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang decided to use his greatest weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Don&#x2019;t you know that my father is a politician? Stop the broadcast and explain that everything was a misunderstanding. Otherwise, I will turn you and your family into mince meat with my father&#x2019;s gang.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a violent threat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, Park Sung-kwang had the ability to carry it out.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Tae-hyuk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why, are you feeling regret?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, your words are truly amazing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the Demon Revealing Mirror. When he came to the rooftop, he had used Spying.</span></p><p><span style="">Until one minute ago, these words had been written in Park Sung-kwang&#x2019;s title.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Son of politician Park Seong-ho.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">However, that was now empty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What this meant was...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know what a great person you are, but I will say this&#x2014;it is nothing. Your title... The words you use to represent yourself... That is now empty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Sung-kwang was confused. He couldn&#x2019;t understand Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed bitterly.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In the end, you&#x2014;Park Sung-kwang, the son of politician Park Seong-ho&#x2014;disappeared from this world a minute ago.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the country was in an uproar.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
