<p>Chapter 28: Power Deployment #5</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk first marked his own building map and easily divided it into several sections. He then proceeded to install the traps at the marked locations.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, let&#x2019;s check it out.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">On the map, he had carefully written down directions on how to direct the voyeur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he followed those exact directions, then he would be able to put his opponent into a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">However, some unexpected variables could occur. </span><span style="">Tae-hyuk began visualizing several different situations, and how he deal with them.</span></p><p><span style="">In the meantime, it was time to start self-studying at night.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All sound disappeared from the special activities building.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now... is it 7:05 p.m? It&#x2019;s around the time for the voyeur to move.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was also time for Tae-hyuk to take action.</span></p><p><span style="">Lastly, Tae-hyuk confirmed all of his equipment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything he needed was currently gathered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll go and get ready for the guests.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">B High School&#x2019;s self-study started at 7:00 p.m, which was when the supervisor would wander around to check attendance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All the students were supposed to be in the classroom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once attendance was checked, the supervisor would loosen up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Some students would the special activities building to do other things or even to run away.</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur was aiming for this short gap in timing.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now is the time to do something in secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">While the main building had the latest security systems, the old wooden building didn&#x2019;t even have a common CCTV one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If it wasn&#x2019;t for the geographical advantage of being close to the playground, no one would ever change clothes here.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was hiding in the A-17 area, the place of the first trap. He also spotted a window that was slightly open, which was where the opponent would probably enter through here.</span></p><p><span style="">7:07 p.m.</span></p><p><span style="">The opponent moved.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Kkiiik-</span></i></p><p><span style="">There was no need to check the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the sound of a window opening.</span></p><p><span style="">A black shadow was revealed by the backlight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk minimized his sound as much as possible as he watched the movements of the opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He isn&#x2019;t collecting the cameras.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur merely took out the memory from the camera and checked its contents.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made a small sound, as if he didn&#x2019;t like the content shown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He reset the data and reinstalled the camera.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Everything took less than 10 seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If this was a sport in the Olympics, then would he get a gold medal?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The black shadow finished his work in an instant and left the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t something he had done only once or twice.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the voyeur would have never imagined that someone else was hiding in here.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The binding trap is installed in area A-12. Let&#x2019;s move right away.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk left his hiding place and chased behind the voyeur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponent had stopped at a place 20 metres away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had activated the binding trap and his feet were tied.</span></p><p><span style="">After confirming it, Tae-hyuk moved to the A-13 area.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Now is the most important part.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used the Demon Revealing Mirror to activate Voice Modulation.</span></p><p><span style="">He chose female student A that he had prepared in advance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... Ah.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After Tae-hyuk confirmed that his voice was changed, he spoke loudly enough for the voyeur to hear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-What do I do? I was tired from exercising and forgot!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he changed voices to student B.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The seniors saw me sleeping and just left! I have to change clothes and go straight to the classroom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He changed it back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-yes. Hurry!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Voice Modulation could only imitate people&#x2019;s voices. He had to create the other sound effects himself.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For example, the sound of clothes being taken off.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Sururuk.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The sound of clothes rubbing against skin was heard in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur swallowed his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt disgusted.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;D-Do I really have to do this?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He took off his uniform, leaving him in only short-sleeves and shorts.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Student C will emerge at this point!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ducked out of the classroom and crouched down in front of it.</span></p><p><span style="">He shouted. It sounded like he was speaking from outside the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sunbae-nim! Big trouble! There&#x2019;s a frenzy outside because the voyeur entered the school!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt a presence in the hallway. The voyeur was aghast.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Ugh, what is this?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Tae-hyuk felt dizzy.</span></p><p><span style="">His body almost collapsed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk stabbed his thigh with a stick just to keep conscious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could feel his consciousness coming back.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Is it because I used the skill too much?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This was the first time. Now was the most important part. Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth and imitated the voice of student D with Voice Modulation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The guard said that the police are coming! Come out quickly!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;... I can&#x2019;t miss catching the fish. Just a little more...!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He heard the sound of the voyeur rushing away.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk forced his legs to move and chased after the opponent.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">In order to use his skills, stamina was consumed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had particularly used a lot of it over the past few days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the burden came rushing in at once.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;I think I used more last week... Ah, perhaps...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In that moment, Tae-hyuk recalled An Eun-young&#x2019;s healthy food. His hands clenched at the thought. Surprisingly, it had supplemented a lot of his stamina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After not eating it for a few days, his body sent out a few signals...</span></p><p><span style="">Did he have to eat her food for the rest of his lifetime?&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, he had an ominous feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Anyway, the target is in area B-4. Shall I give it a try?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk imitated the voice of a guard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The police officers are here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused voyeur fell down.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he got up through superhuman willpower and started to run.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, a wall appeared in front of the voyeur.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he had looked closely, then he would be able to see that it was just a painting.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in such a panicked state, such a cold judgement was impossible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he ran to the other side of the hallway to avoid the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">A smile flashed on Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;As expected, he ran to point C.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This time, he imitated the voice of Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will arrest the criminal who violated the Special Sexual Violence Law! You can remain silent, and any of your remarks can be used against you in court. You can appoint a lawyer and have the lawyer speak for you when asked a question. If you don&apos;t have money for a lawyer, you will be appointed a public defender. Do you recognize your rights?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk imitated what he saw in movies as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">The opponent panicked as Tae-hyuk read his version of the Miranda Warning in Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, they were words that the police would say only after arresting the criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But it was still enough to panic the opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur heard Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s cry and started to run faster.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Now, go straight. Then you will be very happy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took a deep breath as he watched as the opponent ran in the direction planned.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">He wouldn&#x2019;t get any merits from catching this criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was happy since he could spend the rest of his time practicing Forgery here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That in itself was satisfying enough.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Anyway, this time I can&#x2019;t get any skill...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how he thought about it, X-ray Vision was a good skill.</span></p><p><span style="">If only...</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Someday, I might get a chance again. At any rate, haven&#x2019;t I solved the case?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He felt bittersweet.</span></p><p><span style="">This was the end of the B High School voyeur incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, something Tae-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t imagined occurred at this moment.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kyaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">A female screamed from the place that the voyeur was running to.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-who? Aren&#x2019;t all the students in the main building?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Students A, B, C and D who remained in the special activities building were hypothetical people created by Tae-hyuk. Did they suddenly pop out in reality?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute. This is the second time I&#x2019;ve heard that voice... Ah, Hana sunbae!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized that he had forgotten about her. </span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana went to France after graduating. Due to that, she could live a leisurely life without attending the self-study at night.</span></p><p>&apos;If I have time then I will come back to teach my cute junior.&#x2019;</p><p>She had obviously said that.</p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk ran forward with a sick expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Lee Hana was in danger.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">The situation had gone seriously sideways.</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur saw that a witness had suddenly appeared and pulled out a weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a middle-aged man wearing a suit, and gave off a meek and intelligent atmosphere.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such a person was a voyeur...</span></p><p><span style="">To Tae-hyuk, he was a stranger; however, Lee Hana might know who he was.</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana alternated her gaze between the criminal and Tae-hyuk with a pale face.</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur asked in a trembling voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I-I, right now, chased by police, stay quiet, don&#x2019;t get hurt, hostage.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Lee Hana closed her mouth and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth. This situation was even more dangerous. He didn&#x2019;t know when the confused opponent would use his weapon against Lee Hana. </span></p><p><span style="">The rabbit was cornered.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Damn. It is entirely my responsibility if Sunbae gets hurt!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk released the Voice Modulation skill.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he approached the two people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ajusshi. Don&#x2019;t get excited and listen to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-Who are you?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A student just passing by.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;G-Go away!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have a lot of camera equipment, so I can tell what your hobby is. According to Article 14 of the Special Sexual Violence Law, a person who uses a camera or other similar methods to film an unaware person&#x2019;s body for their own sexual desires is liable for imprisonment up to five years, or a fine of up to 10 million won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;However, the punishment is double that if you threaten or injure a person with a weapon. &#xA0;So, why don&#x2019;t you have a conversation with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I know! Fuck! I&#x2019;m going to kill both of you! No one will know if I run away after killing you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The voyeur had now turned into a murderer with a weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the blade was now aimed at Seo Tae-hyuk instead of Lee Hana.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Thus far, it is as planned.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Plan A to catch the voyeur had failed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Plan B still remained.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly reached out to his opponent and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then...&quot;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
