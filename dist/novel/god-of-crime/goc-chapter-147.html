<p><span style="">Chapter 147 - Phantom&#x2019;s Counterattack #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Blackjack used a poker hand and went through a 1:1 match between the dealer and the player.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was one of the few casino games that was potentially beneficial to the players.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Six players sat at different tables and were fighting the dealer in front of them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, the atmosphere in the casino was grave.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi opened two cards that the dealer gave him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An Ace of Hearts and Queen of Spades. Blackjack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bosses sitting at the other tables gawked at him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If there was a blackjack, then the player would unconditionally win against the dealer, and they would receive 1.5 times the jackpot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was never a pleasant situation when they were competing against each other.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition to Yamaguchi, Mister Park was also gaining a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng clicked his tongue and said, </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Didn&#x2019;t he already win a few games?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina spoke from her table in the rear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He completely holds the momentum. I think this will end in the Yakuza&#x2019;s victory.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Lady Luck is a capricious person. Even if she is laughing now, you never know when she will betray you. It isn&#x2019;t over until it is over.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He said this, but the momentum was completely on Yamaguchi and Mister Park&#x2019;s side.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng forgot about his own hand for a while as he watched the two people play.</span></p><p><span style="">The dealer&#x2019;s open card was a 9. It was a good hand with a high possibility of going completely without bursting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The card Mister Park received was a 5.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He boldly split it and received one more card.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he bet an additional 10 million won worth of chips.</span></p><p><span style="">The newly received cards were a 6 and a 9.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, he should take one more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But Mister Park stood firm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was hard to win unless the dealer got a bust.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The dealer&#x2019;s second card is a 6. If this happens, there will be one more card... Oh my god. The next card is a 10? T-Then isn&#x2019;t the dealer busted... Mister Park won with 11 and 14? I don&#x2019;t know about 14, but he should&#x2019;ve absolutely taken another card when it was at 11 points!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was so strange that he suspected there was a deal with the dealer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The dealer&apos;s winning percentage of 50% was deliberately decreased to 20%...&#xA0;</span><span style="">No, it was decreased to 10%.</span></p><p><span style="">In the meantime, Mister Park made extreme bets that raised his dividend.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And victory.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was ridiculous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Zheng swallowed back his groan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were too many things he didn&#x2019;t understand.</span></p><p><span style="">Meanwhile, the number of chops between the two people had reversed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The house has 1.53 billion won and I have 1.1 billion won. And the Japanese 1.2 billion won...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina&#x2019;s chips were almost intact. However, her chips had swelled a little bit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She didn&#x2019;t lose any chips due to her stable betting. Her meticulousness could be seen here as well.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng gained 200 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had started with 900 million so that was quite good.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He made bold bets and had a clear understanding of when to stop to increase his odds.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...But haven&#x2019;t they doubled their chips in an hour? No matter how I look at it, that is impossible without buying off the dealer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina licked his lips and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom is the one who prepared the things here. Do you understand what I mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Um...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza might have held hands with Phantom to put together a scam.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of the people here were playing the mafia game to obtain Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If someone was already working with Phantom, then there was no reason to come here.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the Yakuza weren&#x2019;t winning every game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, when they won, their profits were huge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They won so much that it was enough to be called a gambling god.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Meanwhile, the Yakuza had made another bet and picked up 90 million won worth of chips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was huge sum for such a short period of time.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But the two people are playing together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The Yakuza were gaining a huge amount of money due to both Mister Park and Yamaguchi.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In most cases, if the subordinate was unsure of victory then they would forfeit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This meant...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There must be a secret plan to win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng squinted as he watched the Yakuza playing.</span></p><p><span style="">There had to be some trick.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he could find it, then he could reverse the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina spoke carefully to her subordinate so that the other teams couldn&#x2019;t hear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Semon. What do you think?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The time limit for playing this game is 100 minutes, which is already more than half over. If both of you continue making money at the same rate, they won&#x2019;t be able to surpass you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm. that&#x2019;s a good thing. So what do you think is their secret to such great odds?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Unless the Yakuza are incredibly lucky, I can only think that they joined hands with Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom didn&#x2019;t ally with the Yakuza. If that were so, then there would be no point in playing this game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It might be a trap for the Yakuza to kill us.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Hrmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina gave a subtle groan.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The possibility wasn&#x2019;t 0%.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But even so, she couldn&#x2019;t believe it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Phantom had many chances to kill us if he wanted. Not long ago, on our date...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He might have changed his mind since then.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Either way, I can&#x2019;t believe that Phantom has joined hands with the Yakuza. Isn&#x2019;t there a chance that they have psychic powers?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, perhaps.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon agreed with the ridiculous comment.</span></p><p><span style="">By the way, it was the right answer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mister Park gave a sign to the dealer using his fingers, which meant to let him win.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had used the Hallucinogenic Incense to make a puppet out of the dealer and then used the dealer as a card shark.</span></p><p><span style="">After that, he flipped over his palm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a sign to stop giving him cards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Using the dealer as a card shark easily led to the Yakuza&#x2019;s victory.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi Takeshi asked in a small voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mister Park. How much do you have in chips now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;730 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have 820 million, so if we combine both of our stacks, that is a total of 1.55 billion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As it happens, it is the same as the Red Lady.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhuhu, we both have exactly 1.55 billion won worth of chips. There are five minutes left so we can&#x2019;t relax.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If the third game picked requires a dealer...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Our victory.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. You did a really good job.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The one who controls the dealer will become the king of the casino. The other teams have also prepared a winning strategy, but it seems like ours is the best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute. Please refrain from talking. The Red Lady is coming.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Excuse me. I&#x2019;m sorry but can I talk to you for a minute?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina and Semon, who were likely to lose the number one spot, came up to the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The smiles disappeared from the Yakuza member&#x2019;s faces.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but can we change seats? It feels like you might have something with the dealer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huhu, that isn&#x2019;t the case. But I will ease your suspicions. I&#x2019;ll change seats.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The time remaining was five minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If she didn&#x2019;t earn the same amount of chips as the Yakuza then the rankings would reverse.</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina bit her lip and shifted her gaze to Semon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One of Semon&#x2019;s eyes started trembling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phew...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina sighed with relief.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, Semon sent her the signal that she wanted.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant he had succeeded in counting all the cards on the table that the Yakuza had been playing at.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to prepare for this situation, she had ordered Semon to watch the Yakuza&#x2019;s table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Semon, who had terribly good eyesight, was able to see all the card patterns on the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Since the cards have been counted, I can unconditionally make money. I need to at least tie with the Yakuza so that were start from the same point in the next game...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She had the ability to remember everything she saw and Semon was a genius at strategy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She was confident that she could win any game if the conditions were the same.</span></p><p><span style="">The time remaining was five minutes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The last hand of Blackjack began.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina sighed with relief.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hu... There was no support. Still, I narrowed the gap in the game against the dealer....&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">She has won an additional 30 million won. It was the same with the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the Red Mafia and Yakuza were tied at exactly 1.58 billion won.</span></p><p><span style="">In the meantime, Phantom appeared and summarized the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will do an intermediate check. The Red Mafia and the Yakuza both have 1.58 billion won, while the Triads have 1.14 billion won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The chips acquired by the three groups totaled to 1.3 billion won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a tremendous return since they started at three billion.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng clicked his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everybody is great. I am good at the games but... I never thought I would be the lowest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is still the final game. Everybody has their own area of expertise, so why don&#x2019;t you choose one?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you mean me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t care.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi&#x2019;s eyes flashed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. What are the young people talking about without me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is about who should pick the last game. I think it should be the one with the lowest amount of money.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, the Triads had the lowest amount of money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a high probability that they would pick a game that relied on abilities rather than luck.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Caterina was confident about winning in a head-to-head competition.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng would choose the last game.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yamaguchi thought it wasn&#x2019;t a bad proposal.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will listen to what it is first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If it involved the dealer then he would absolutely win.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would listen to the game and accept if it was appropriate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the game didn&#x2019;t need a dealer then he would use an excuse to play another game.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then how about Bluff Poker?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a game where they placed a card on their forehead that only the opponent could see.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The success or failure of their bluffs played a huge role on who would win.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As it happened, Tae-hyuk played this game at the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">Yamaguchi nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to play Bluff Poker, a dealer was required to split the cards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could ask the dealer to secretly tell him what his card was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is fine with me. Little Lady?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would also like to play Bluff Poker.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Due to being at the bottom, Li Zheng added one condition.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The lieutenants might look at the cards and secretly tell you. Therefore, this time I would like to fight with just the three of us. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm... Then send out the lieutenants?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Exactly.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It doesn&#x2019;t matter to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am fine with that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu... Then let&#x2019;s get started right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Caterina&apos;s winning strategy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yamaguchi&apos;s winning strategy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Bluff Poker was a game where all these winning strategies could be played.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was no reason to resist.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Li Zheng had a counterattack that could destroy all of this.</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park, Jin, and Semon left once Li Zheng gave a signal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The three remaining were the bosses.</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, there were the cameramen and dealers.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s start the final round of the mafia game.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Li Zheng spoke some strange words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hu, huhu... The game will end with my victory.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It sounded like a prophecy.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom watched the mafia game through the TV.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the place where the spectators had watched the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom drank coke from a champagne glass and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Coke is cheaper than a bottle of wine that costs hundreds of thousands of won. &#xA0;By the way, everyone is very confident. Just looking at their expressions, everyone thinks that they will win.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m sure they found their own winning strategy. But did you know? I made it like that on purpose.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew about Caterina&#x2019;s remarkable memory and included number games.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew that Mister Park had the incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">So he set up a casino where the dealers could be taken advantage of.</span></p><p><span style="">And...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For Li Zheng, I placed a few game conditions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">On the TV screen, Jin knocked out Mister Park and Semon with a weapon.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Obviously, I told them not to bring any weapons inside, but sniper threats from outside are acceptable.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom deliberately created loopholes for victory.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His purpose was to bring them here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All of this without knowing that it was a trap prepared by Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Zheng implemented his plan.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
