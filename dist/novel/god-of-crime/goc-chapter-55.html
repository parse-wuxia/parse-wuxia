<p><span style="">Chapter 55: Black Sheep Exodus #2 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">He was a man who gave off a sharp impression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Jun-tae continued to point out the loopholes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He might be leading you down a path but it might be heading towards a cliff.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, someone who had been listening quietly sneered at Jun-tae.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then are you saying you have a better idea?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the only woman in Group A, Jeon Mina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mina showed complete trust in Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, but... I want to see more tangible evidence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is that so? I know people like you. You can&#x2019;t help but feel envious when you see someone doing well. In the end, you will ruin everyone because of your pride.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jun-tae&#x2019;s face distorted at Mina&#x2019;s acidic tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I saw all of you moving together! Perhaps this is a plan to screw everyone else?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Isn&#x2019;t he a wolf planted by Choi Sung-yeol?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In no time, the crowd split into two groups and started fighting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was clearly an urgent situation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was an internal conflict in the group when they should be trying to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed and intervened between those who were fighting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mina. Jun-tae. Both of you calm down. First of all, listen to my plan before you make a decision.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jun-tae looked at him and shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So that plan can kill all of us!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Why are you so suspicious? You should trust someone for once. Cheol-su used his own money to save those of us who were in a life-threatening situation. Let&apos;s see... Omo. Do you have 70 million right now? That is why you are so relaxed. Ah, perhaps...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina eyed Jun-tae suspiciously before walking over to Tae-hyuk and whispering something in his ears.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t it obvious that there would be a wolf planted by Tiwai here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk nodded quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then isn&#x2019;t he the most suspicious? He has a lot of money and he&#x2019;s also planting suspicion. No matter how I look at it, he has to be the wolf. It would be better to get rid of such people before going through with the Exodus.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hrmm...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk paused for a moment before answering.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I can&#x2019;t do that. While there are definitely wolves among us, if we are suspicious of each other then it is what the wolf wants. First of all, I am thinking of taking everyone with me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, then the wolf...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I said I would take them all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mina&#x2019;s protests died down at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s strong will.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes... I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk activated the Voice Modulation skill.</span></p><p><span style="">[Voice Modulation has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-You can imitate the voice of Kim Bum-soo.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Bum-soo was an actor who often appeared in historical dramas.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He mainly played the role of the king.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the charismatic voice that really made him seem like a king of the Joseon Dynasty.</span></p><p><span style="">There were two groups in front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to bring them together, he would use Kim Bum-soo&#x2019;s voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please pay attention. Right now, there are those who believe in me. There are also those who feel doubt. The two groups exist, and I can understand both. I was afraid after entering the Death Circus. All of you can&#x2019;t be sure that the path you are walking on is correct. Therefore, I will walk in front. Right now, I am going to challenge the &#x2018;Puzzle House.&#x2019; After that, you can decide whether to follow me and clear it, or to give up. I&#x2019;m just suggesting a path.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You will challenge first? We won&#x2019;t be used as sacrifices to identify the winning strategy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You can also choose the order that you desire. Anyways, I am planning to escape with everyone. &quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The contents absolutely weren&#x2019;t trivial</span></p><p><span style="">This was something that often occurred at military training grounds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A demonstration by a skilled assistant.</span></p><p><span style="">However, his voice was overflowing with charisma.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The combination of the voice and the words gave them a strange sense of trust.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This guy could help them leave with their lives.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such sentiments formed in the minds of the gathered people.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, Boss! All of a sudden, your voice has changed, making it seem like a god!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Someone suddenly called Tae-hyuk &#x2018;Boss&#x2019;.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk released the Voice Modulation skill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. I took some classes on eloquence in the past, and I tried to use some of it just now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. At any rate, I believe in Boss. Show us how to escape.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Jun-tae&#x2019;s expression showed that he couldn&#x2019;t understand it as he muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s just one speech...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the wave of suspicion disappeared, Jun-tae was forced to follow quietly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Mina looked at him with suspicious eyes until the end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The root of the problem still hadn&#x2019;t disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The Puzzle House, one of the most notorious Death Circus attractions.</span></p><p><span style="">In a sealed room, there was a structure that kept displaying puzzles on a monitor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The problem was the level of difficulty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One by one, the levels were manageable.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, a person had to challenge a few times in a row.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also hundreds of patterns.</span></p><p><span style="">If any mistakes happened, then a guillotine would fall and one part of the body would be cut off.</span></p><p><span style="">First, the fingers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then, the arms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end...</span></p><p><span style="">There was no dropping out in the middle.</span></p><p><span style="">The most terrible thing was to confirm the right answer with a body part in the guillotine.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That body part would be cut off if the answer turned out to be incorrect.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Body parts were cut off without any anesthesia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A pronounced shock that led to death would often occur.</span></p><p><span style="">The Puzzle House was a large glass box, so it was a structure that completely showed what was happening inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Puzzle House&#x2019;s prize was 50 million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">All they needed to do was come out of it alive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The amount was overwhelmingly high compared to other attractions.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, there was a man who challenged the Puzzle House.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a Mensa member with an IQ of higher than 140.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He focused and made it to the middle part of the puzzles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he made a mistake with one puzzle.</span></p><p><span style="">The five fingers that he placed in the guillotine were cut off.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The funny thing was that he would remain alive as long as the injuries were treated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, this wasn&#x2019;t because they cared for the participants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to make sure that the participant didn&#x2019;t die easily so that the guests could enjoy it for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="">The treated man looked stunned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if he concentrated, then he could clear the rest of the problems without losing anything other than his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">But that wasn&apos;t it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The man knew it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he made a mistake, then he would die.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This thought weighed down on him like heavy shackles on his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He collapsed in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was worried that the right answer was too obvious and chose the wrong answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Arms...&#xA0;</span><span style="">Legs...&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, his neck...</span></p><p><span style="">He was one of the best participants in the Death Circus and he lost his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After witnessing that, no participants challenged the Puzzle House.</span></p><p><span style="">After three hours passed, a second challenger appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">Seo Tae-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Tae-hyuk entered the Puzzle House, he saw a bearded man sitting in a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you going to challenge?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are many people waiting. Let&#x2019;s start straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sat on the chair in the middle of the Puzzle House and placed one arm in a small guillotine.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a tool for cutting off the fingers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Guillotines made for cutting off the arms, legs and heads were also inside the room.</span></p><p><span style="">As he sat down on the chair, the first problem appeared on the wall-mounted monitor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The first problem had a simple level of difficulty.</span></p><p><span style="">Question 1) 2+2*2=</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk put his brain into full operation and came up with the answer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He manipulated the panel and chose the number 6.</span></p><p><span style="">The terrible Puzzle House began.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-The right answer once again!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh my god!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How many problems has it been so far?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;27...28!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The crowd outside cheered as they saw Tae-hyuk solving the problems.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were dubious at first but their voices gradually rose as Tae-hyuk solved the problems one by one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The great thing wasn&#x2019;t that he was solving all the problems.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was doing everything at a tremendous speed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, how could he solve that problem in one second?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;B-Boss is a genius! No, it isn&#x2019;t a genius level. It&#x2019;s like he knew all the problems already!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-Amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They could live.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they followed the Boss then they could get out of here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hope filled the faces of the participants.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A-All 30 questions are correct...! The Puzzle House is cleared... He did it without getting hurt at all!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For the first time, cheers rang out in the Death Circus.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Waaaaaaaah!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk got up and spoke to the bearded man.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Please prepare for the next guest.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Oh, yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The bearded man replied with a stunned expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been responsible for the Puzzle House for two years, yet this was the first time he saw a person clear this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was sure that it would never occur again in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk slowly walked out of the Puzzle House and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is it? Simple right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wahhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">50 million won in 10 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="">There were some who shed tears at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s tremendous achievement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Jun-tae still had a sour expression on his face as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is even more suspicious. It seemed like you knew all the problems. You are in fact a spy planted here by the organizers... hup hup&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">The person next to Jun-tae blocked his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Boss! Never mind this brat. Then a second person will enter right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then who...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I would like someone to volunteer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough! Who wants to enter the Puzzle House next?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how overwhelming Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s victory was, no one was willing to go.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once another person entered the Puzzle House, Tae-hyuk planned to tell them the right answers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, if Tae-hyuk was truly a spy, then he would likely reveal his true colours with the next participant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The third was less likely than the second...</span></p><p><span style="">While everyone was busy thinking...</span></p><p><span style="">Someone walked forward.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was An Eun-jeong who was hiding in the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will be the second person.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohh! This young lady? Fighting!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sighs of relief were heard.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong had infinite trust in Tae-hyuk, just like Mina.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had been quiet, but now it was her turn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong swallowed her saliva as she looked at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk had a strange look on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I want to say something before An Eun-jeong enters.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? W-what...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the other participants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was obviously a wolf in sheepskin among them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tiwai has planted spies in here, famously known as wolves, and I know who the spy is.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong&#x2019;s eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t understand why he was saying this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoon Jong-hyun then opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is there really a spy?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. And if the wolf doesn&#x2019;t confess right now... I won&#x2019;t tell the correct answer to the wolf. Then we can handle it simply.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. Then it doesn&#x2019;t matter if we aren&#x2019;t a wolf.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Indeed. Of course, if you are one of them then please raise your hand quietly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at them with an expression like he knew everything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the wolf didn&#x2019;t reveal their identity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, no one came out? Then I will tell the wolf this. Surely you don&#x2019;t think that I didn&#x2019;t notice such suspicious behaviour?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I will proceed immediately. Ah, right. I have something to say to Eun-jeong noona. Take a look at this once you are sitting down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk handed Eun-jeong a small folded note.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong nodded quietly.</span></p><p><span style="">The second person entered the Puzzle House.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bearded man greeted her with an interested look.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time a female participant had entered this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you going to participate?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-jeong looked at the note Tae-hyuk gave her with an uneasy expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What did it say?</span></p><p><span style="">In a flash, five of her fingers were placed in the guillotine.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if Tae-hyuk told her all of the correct answers, it was natural to feel nervous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong felt cold sweat drip down her back.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before solving the puzzle, she had to check the note Cheol-su gave her..</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will read this first.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do as you like.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, Eun-jeong couldn&#x2019;t move.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only thing she could do was move her left hand to manipulate the panel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Eun-jeong unfolded the note from Tae-hyuk and started to slowly read it.</span></p><p><span style="">This was what was written:</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Noona betrayed those who trusted Noona.</span></i> <i><span style="">Noona should know the pain that they experienced.</span></i> <i><span style="">In fact, I&#x2019;m not sure who the wolf is yet.</span></i> <i><span style="">However, I should give confidence to the others,</span></i> <i><span style="">so I am going to make Noona a wolf.</span></i> <i><span style="">Everyone can live by sacrificing one person.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then I wish you luck.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong was furious.</span></p><p><span style="">Betrayal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk&apos;s betrayal.</span></p><p><span style="">Now she would die here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Her limbs would be cut off in a gruesome manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Eun-jeong shook her body to get out of the chair.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, she was already stuck.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She couldn&#x2019;t get away.</span></p><p><span style="">The first problem flashed on the screen.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
