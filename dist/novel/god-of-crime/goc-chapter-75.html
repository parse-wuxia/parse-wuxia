<p><span style="">Chapter 75 - Doll Play #1 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">There was a Christmas holiday mood on the streets.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite the early hour, people were gathered together to enjoy the festival.</span></p><p><span style="">The new PD of ABS Station, Shin Se-ho, yawned as he watched the people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The AD, holding the camera, asked with a smile. (</span><span style="">TN: AD = audio/assistant director, I think? If it is something else, let me know in the comments)</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;PD-nim, did you have a late night yesterday?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Bah! I&#x2019;m so numb that it feels like my bones are breaking. Originally, I tried to sleep until the afternoon but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped. We are hyenas searching for a scoop.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho was suffering from the life of being a part time worker, so he had to go to the interview with an AD instead of a proper cameraman.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wanted to be in charge of a popular current affairs program one day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That opportunity might be surprisingly close.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho rose from his seat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was time for the investigators to go to work.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Straighten your spirit. From now on, we are going into battle.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The AD rubbed his hand on his shirt and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But PD-nim. What incident are we going to now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... I need to restore my spirit. I didn&#x2019;t explain. Amputated body parts were found yesterday morning, and the arms and legs were used to decorate a Christmas tree. It was already reported on the airwaves. I think it will probably be on air tomorrow.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah, jackpot... A completely psychotic bastard. By the way, I haven&#x2019;t seen it on the news.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho clicked his tongue with a regretful expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know how the AD could get this job if he didn&#x2019;t know how the press worked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course not. What day is it today?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Christmas.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But what would happen if there was such drab news? On a day like today, the contents of the broadcast should only be delightful and warm.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The AD nodded with an expression of understanding.</span></p><p><span style="">Then Shin Se-ho laughed and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course, that is just for the big stations. We don&#x2019;t have to worry about public opinion so we will broadcast it today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you get permission from the chief?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course. This evening, we will be the first ones to report on this incident during the golden hour. So shoot it properly. There is no time to edit it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span><span style="">Yes! I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was time for the interview.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho and the AD tried to enter the crime scene, but the police stopped them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They showed the ID of the broadcasting station and searched for Cho Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective Cho! This is a coverage from ABS Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk walked out of the crowd with a dignified expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You have another coverage. Aigoo, you were sent again.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho laughed at Cho Kang-suk and waved,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wow, who is this? If it isn&#x2019;t Detective Cho Kang-suk! You always seem to be busy. Haha.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, Cho Kang-suk wasn&#x2019;t feeling very pleasant towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;An interview will be tough right now. I can only give you a brief overview.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a perfect response from the manual.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Shin Se-ho wasn&#x2019;t satisfied with that much.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can&#x2019;t we see the bodies? They will be covered with a mosaic during the broadcast.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Sorry, I&#x2019;m afraid that isn&#x2019;t going to happen, as they have been transferred to the morgue.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s voice was smoother than when they last met at the cafe.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t like it, but he was on duty.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho covered his mouth with his hand and whispered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I really can&#x2019;t see it? Ah right, there is a rumor that you have an important position right now. If you don&#x2019;t mind then please tell me about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk confirmed that the man holding the camera also had an audio recorder.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he made even one small mistake, then it would come out in the newspaper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The fatigue from staying up all night seemed to pile on him instantly.</span></p><p><span style="">Where did the PD get the scent?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rumors were surprisingly scary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe he even knew the existence of the [God of Crime].&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even so, he had to avoid letting that name out of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but it is out of my purview. I&#x2019;ll give you the interview and let you film the scene as much as possible. Although it is impossible to take you directly to the crime scene, you can draw a picture of the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho smiled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew that the police were hiding something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But right now, he wanted information about the case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to draw the line precisely to get it.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s go to a coffee shop nearby and talk. I&#x2019;ll buy the coffee. In addition, I have a corporate card. Haha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Shin Se-ho gave a secret signal to the AD.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As previously discussed, the AD disappeared from other people&#x2019;s eyes into a nearby building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk saw it and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where is the cameraman?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He needed to go to the toilet all of a sudden.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho inwardly laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">What? They wouldn&#x2019;t show the scene of the incident?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had brought a camera equipped with a telephoto lens that cost several million won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be like capturing a vivid scene in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could do anything dirty in order to pick up a scoop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That was Shin Se-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, I have a call so just give me a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk hurriedly looked at his smartphone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho noticed that Kang-suk&#x2019;s expression changed as he confirmed the caller.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It smelled like a scoop.</span></p><p><span style="">His prediction was accurate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The caller was [God of Crime].</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, this is Cho Kang-suk.&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Hello, Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i> <i><span style="">No, should I say Merry Christmas?</span></i></p><p><span style="">This time, it was Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s voice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was strange, even if Kang-suk knew the identity.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How did that person change their voice?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is going on? I don&#x2019;t think you would call just to say hello.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Don&#x2019;t be so pushy.</span></i> <i><span style="">I am a little timid.</span></i> <i><span style="">Rather, I prepared a special Christmas gift for the police.</span></i> <i><span style="">I want to return the bomb that I couldn&#x2019;t bring back the other day.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...W-Where is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You&#x2019;ve already received the &#x2018;dolls&#x2019; as a present from someone else, but I haven&#x2019;t started playing yet.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;Doll? Ah....&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes widened as he realized what the other person meant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The God of Crime was talking about this crime scene.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Shouldn&#x2019;t a party have firecrackers?</span></i> <i><span style="">So I&#x2019;ve placed a bomb in there with Detective Cho Kang-suk.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-Wait a minute. D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You should hurry.</span></i> <i><span style="">It will go off in five minutes.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuook...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk gave a strange groan.</span></p><p><span style="">Was this revenge for the attempt to arrest him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was confusing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After that, the person hung up.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk rushed over to the police and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-We have to run away from here! There is a bomb! Tell the people nearby to evacuate right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Bomb?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police moved quickly at Kang-suk&#x2019;s words.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was fortunate that there was a blockade near the area, and civilian access was controlled.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho whistled as he grasped the atmosphere and walked up to Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huiyu. What is happening all of a sudden? You received notice of a bomb attack near here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk made a mistake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had forgotten about that person during the call.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but Shin Se-ho PD should also evacuate. There was a tip that a bomb was installed here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa! Who was that call from just now? It seemed like you knew the person. Do the police have a type of inside contact with a terrorist organization? Can I think that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now isn&#x2019;t the time to talk! Does this look like a prank? Bomb! Do you want your head to fly away?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kang-suk lost his temper.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho quietly retreated, like a dog with its tail between its leg after being kicked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, his body was shaking with joy.</span></p><p><span style="">His senses were telling him something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Something was happening here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be a scoop that surprised the world.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The AD, who set up his camera on the roof of a building that was 200m away from the crime scene, couldn&#x2019;t help sneezing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah... It is cold.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was much colder than he expected because he was so high up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, that damn Shin Se-ho. Who wants to be an AD? Once I get promoted...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He grumbled as he adjusted the camera&#x2019;s focus, but then he noticed something strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The situation of the police gathered at the scene wasn&#x2019;t ordinary.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed as if they were running away.</span></p><p><span style="">The AD was puzzled.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, a message came from Shin Se-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Jackpot.</span></i> <i><span style="">There is a bomb threat at the scene right now.</span></i> <i><span style="">If you find the culprit then this will be an enormous scoop!</span></i> <i><span style="">Get a close up of the scene.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A bomb...? No, then I...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The AD was stunned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he was 200 metres away, he didn&#x2019;t know how strong the blast was.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He might end up being killed by the explosion, but Shin Se-ho wanted him to shoot the scene of the bomb exploding?</span></p><p><span style="">However, people needed to take risks to get a scoop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t a dedicated cameraman, but he had been holding it for five years.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His journalist&#x2019;s heart started to blaze.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like being a reporter in a war zone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, a man only lives once. Today I will take the best video of my life!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The AD focused on the scene and waited quietly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In no time, the police had evacuated so the street was empty.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Huh? That person...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was strangely dressed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was wearing an opera mask on his face and a leather jacket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">One hand was holding a long iron pipe.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Don&#x2019;t tell me...! Terrorist?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The AD swallowed his saliva.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe this really was a great scene.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a strange thing happened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The unidentified man in an opera mask looked up at where the AD was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A-A coincidence?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He was 200 metres away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Without the telephoto lens, a person would look smaller than an ant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yet he was looking over here?&#xA0;</span><span style="">A drop of sweat dripped down the AD&#x2019;s nose.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Ssik-</span></i></p><p><span style="">However, it wasn&#x2019;t a coincidence. </span><span style="">The man in the opera mask smirked and his thumb across his neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hiiik!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew!&#xA0;</span><span style="">That person knew he was here!</span></p><p><span style="">The AD sat down in fear.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, this scene has been cleared of police.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But what about that fly?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He used Spying to check if there was anyone around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Expanding the scope of Spying had a limit of once per day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He noticed that someone was shooting this place from the roof of a building that was 206.2m away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe it was a journalist or someone similar.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked and drew his thumb across his neck in a threatening gesture.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he would have to handle that after looking around the scene.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe it wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He planned to debut the [God of Crime] to the media sooner or later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe this was a good opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s draw a picture.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he drew the scenery using Forgery, he could draw the powerful image that was contained in it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was basically like psychometry as he drew what happened here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could see traces of the past.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked over to the tree that had been decorated with body parts and murmured,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The bodies were taken away but the tree is still here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Blood was still remaining in some places.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would draw the remaining image based on that.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Easel OK, sketchbook OK, paints OK.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After all the preparations were finished, Tae-hyuk triggered the Forgery skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He started drawing in a relaxed posture like he was a landscape artist.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, a strange illusion emerged in front of Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ugh... It is the second time but I&#x2019;m still not used to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A woman was lying on an operating table, her face distorted in pain.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But there wasn&#x2019;t just one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the other side, someone else...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Heok... Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The image was over.</span></p><p><span style="">Obviously, it hadn&#x2019;t occurred here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps it was the place of dismemberment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Surgery?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">[The Forgery skill has found an intense image.]</span></p><p><span style="">[The work has been completed through automatic mode.]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva and looked at the finished work and muttered in a low voice,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, this was the reason. It isn&#x2019;t just a mutilation murder incident.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had captured the truth about the Doll Play Case.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
