<p><span style="">Chapter 91 - Big Brother&#x2019;s Raid #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia was a Russian crime organization.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Decades ago, they were a hydra with multiple heads, and were notorious for committing all types of evil deeds throughout the world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would incorporate the beliefs of Zvezda, the symbol of the Ivankov family. (Zvezda= star in Russian apparently).</span></p><p><span style="">After a bloody struggle, he became the godfather with tens of thousands of members.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ivankov recruited Soviet troops, who had been unemployed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, into his large organization.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he acquired large quantities of scattered weapons to make a private army that he would use as mercenaries in the world&#x2019;s conflict zones.</span></p><p><span style="">The war came to an end.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Zvezda accumulated tremendous wealth as an arms dealer and mercenary leader.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After Ivankov&#x2019;s death, the Hydra&#x2019;s neck that he had cut off, started to regrow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people that Ivankov trained aimed their guns at each other and conflict swallowed the Red Mafia again.</span></p><p><span style="">The difference was that the weapons were guns and missiles, not swords.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the war persisted, only ruin would be left in its wake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ivankov&#x2019;s legal successor, the young boss Kataros, was well aware of this.</span></p><p><span style="">An old castle, Winter, hundreds of kilometres away from Moscow was Zvezda&apos;s home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As the name suggested, it was surrounded by white snow all year round.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Boss. Our plan was completely foiled by Phantom.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros sat on his office chair and looked at Semon, his second in command.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a genius with an IQ of 160 and had three doctoral degrees in economics.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since Ivankov had been the boss, Semon had managed the organization&#x2019;s economics and was notorious for weapons smuggling around the world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were rumors that he could supply submarines, tanks, and nuclear weapons at any time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only one he bowed to was the boss of Red Mafia, Kataros.</span></p><p><span style="">Semon said with an angry face,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Revenge is necessary. The damage he inflicted is millions of dollars.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Killing the Phantom won&#x2019;t make all that come back, Semon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But Kataros, it is dangerous if you ignore this. The other bosses won&#x2019;t stand it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Apart from the godfather of the Red Mafia, there were nine representative bosses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kataros had legitimacy as Ivankov&#x2019;s successor, but his forces were the weakest.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He only kept his position due to the absolute support of Semon.</span></p><p><span style="">The Red Mafia dealt with high risk crimes such as drugs, prostitution, trafficking, arms trading and casinos.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Kataros was interested in the so-called brain business.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He supported students who were smart but had no money to study things like law and economics. After graduation, they would work in the Russian mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">It took a long time to see the results.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, the other bosses objected violently.</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros and Semon just prepared it silently.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The world is changing. I want talent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But it is money that moves the world. If there isn&#x2019;t a large amount of money available then Boss won&#x2019;t be able to do what you want. That&#x2019;s why you started the forgeries...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He stopped before pointing out that it was the boss&#x2019; failure.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;And it failed. I know. Phantom hit us perfectly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So I&#x2019;ve prepared some extra budget.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon was the man who handled the biggest amount of money among the nine bosses of the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t understand why Kataros was refusing his aid.</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros said with a laugh,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you. I love talent. It is the same with me. Everything I&#x2019;m doing is to prove that I am fit for the position of the boss.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros had only been one of the nine bosses for one year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t have any achievements.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If this situation persisted then Kataros would be forced out by the other bosses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t like someone being fired from work. Rather, his neck would be sliced and he would be displayed on the streets of Moscow.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That Phantom person is very interesting. It feels like he enjoys having people play in the palm of his hand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If Boss commands it, then I will cut off his head right away and decorate it in a well-visible place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros coughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Semon was highly loyal but sometimes it was a bit intense.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s just watch first. We are not the only ones aiming at him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you mean the Triads?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. The long-term organ trafficking business they were running was blown up. It seems like the damage is considerable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The damage is bigger here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros coughed again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He spoke in a strangely sweet but sarcastic tone.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They boasted that they sent their strongest killer to South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He bought a lot of weapons from us. A high number of explosives... He can fight a war in order to get Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If Phantom manages to defeat the killer from the Triads, then I will go and see for myself. Maybe he is the person I have been looking for.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Semon narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;South Korea will be set on fire.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. The movements of the Triad and the Yakuza are strange. Soon there will be a war.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kataros said prophetically.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Inside the hotel room, &#x2018;Conquest of Paradise&#x2019; was playing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was classical music that expressed the joy of Columbus discovering the New World.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother was moving his body on top of a woman while listening to the music.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heok... Heeeok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The girl panted roughly before becoming quiet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother, who had been choking her from above, released his grip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the woman&#x2019;s body flailed like a broken doll.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So don&#x2019;t just follow anyone. By the way, what was your name? Well, it doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother inserted his fingers into an eye and pulled out the eyeball.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pulled out a combat knife and cut the connected optic nerve.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He always carried a bottle of formalin in his bag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would be okay as a souvenir.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother picked up the phone on the floor and called the janitor.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-W-Why weren&#x2019;t you picking up?</span></i> <i><span style="">What can I do for you?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is some garbage to clean in the K Hotel Suite. She hasn&#x2019;t died yet, so you can sell her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">I guess you didn&#x2019;t have a favorite part this time.</span></i> <i><span style="">Just before...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey. Just do what your job is. If you have a long tongue then I will shorten it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">H-Hik!</span></i> <i><span style="">I-I&#x2019;m really sorry.</span></i> <i><span style="">I understand.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then please have a shower and I will clean it up nicely.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Big Brother went to the shower and turned on the cold water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His body was hot with excitement.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Chwaaaaak!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The icy cold water poured on his head, but it didn&#x2019;t cool the dark desires in his blood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a long trip and he could kill dozens of people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. It is clean.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After finishing out the shower, he found that his room was tidy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The bed-sheet that had been dirtied with something red had been changed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The janitor did a good job.</span></p><p><span style="">The table had a report that listed everything about his target, Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother wore a dressing gown and sat down to read it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...He touched the Russian mafia? This brat is putting himself out in the open. I should check him out once.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he drank wine in the suite, attendants emerged from the darkness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They placed various weapons on the table and disappeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother saw the familiar Russian semi-automatic gun Torkarev TT-33 among them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He aimed it at one of the attendants and pulled the trigger.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The head of the attendant scattered like a smashed watermelon.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The faces of the other attendant turned white. He was</span><span style="">&#xA0;terrified of the man who laughed like killing one person was a fun game.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hu... Now I am a little calm. I&apos;m sorry but can you call the janitor?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! U-Understood!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The survivor sighed with relief.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang tang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I like killing those who think they survived the most.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After killing the two attendants, Big Brother realized that he had no one to call the janitor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Was this a little too much?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Anyway, his killing spree was just starting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He laughed like a child receiving a new toy.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The Triads had dispatched a skilled killer to catch Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was armed with a large number of firearms distributed from the Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An enemy&#xA0;different from the criminals so far had emerged.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t know this and was handling the enemies in front of him with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No... No matter how delicious you tteokbokki is... Isn&#x2019;t it a little too much to make it for all the children in the orphanage?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The one who spoke was Sister Viviana, a nun who cared for the children at St. Mary&#x2019;s Orphanage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am always thankful. After Hye-mi ate it last time, she was bragging loudly.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Still, no matter how simple the food, it was more than 30 servings.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk put the sauce into the large pot of boiling rice cakes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He grunted as he started to stir the contents with a large spatula that was more like a shovel.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The smell is unbelievably good!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I used a good hot pepper paste. And this seasoning...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sprinkled some white powder into the pot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sister Viviana tilted her head and asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you putting in now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is a secret. Do you know any chefs who would tell their secrets?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ehhh... Surely it isn&#x2019;t cocaine or...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">This nun...&#xA0;</span><span style="">She had a naive face and harsh manner of speaking,&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wasn&#x2019;t the Red Mafia, who dealt with such things.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is Miwon. MSG is good for your mouth, regardless of your body. Ah right, some people treat it as a crime.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Omo. No?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Anyway, it is now completed so please help me put it on the plates.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can help.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin said from where she was snooping around the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sister, be careful. It is hot so you might get burnt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin picked up the pot with her right arm and started to add the rice cakes to the plate.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This arm, it is strong. It isn&#x2019;t hot holding something like this, and is quite comfortable.</span></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, Kim Soo-bin seemed to like the Machina.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Speaking of the arm. Would it be better to use it a bit more carefully? It is still a machine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A friend gave it to me so it won&#x2019;t be respectful if I don&#x2019;t use it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;F-Friend...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was good if she liked it.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin looked around the orphanage.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am leaving here soon, so I wanted to give them a last present.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then you should do it yourself!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t cook.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Soo-bin and Song Hye-mi were leaving the orphanage to stay at Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was only a short time until they graduated school and became self-reliant, but there were still freeloaders in Cho Kang-suk&#x2019;s house.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to the Machina, Cho Kang-suk could now be at ease when going to catch criminals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-ran also confirmed that they would have the promised date sooner or later.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! Tteokboki!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Once dinner was ready, the children entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Sister Viviana spoke as she watched them eating the delicious food.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you very much.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you want to eat the tteokbokki?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, for many other things.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sister Viviana smiled like she knew everything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then all of a sudden, the expression disappeared from Viviana&#x2019;s face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She spoke in a voice that was empty of any emotion.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There will be many trials for you in the future, but don&#x2019;t worry. Your skills will become even stronger in the future. In the near future, someone will appear asking for help. Don&apos;t ignore him. You must definitely take care of him...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Sister Viviana?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;....Eh? I&#x2019;m sorry. I must have fallen asleep. Ahaha...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sister Viviana blushed like she was embarrassed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked several times about what she just said but she couldn&#x2019;t remember anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;What...? It felt like someone borrowed Viviana&#x2019;s mouth to give me a message... I shouldn&#x2019;t refuse to help?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Viviana&#x2019;s words were strangely embedded in his head.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Breaking news.</span></i> <i><span style="">In Seoul, a person with guns has taken hostages at a bar.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk suddenly looked at the TV after hearing the report.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was clearly an entertainment program being broadcasted...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A gunman?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached the TV and listened to the announcer&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I&apos;m sorry. We are eating... I&#x2019;ll turn to another channel.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, wait a minute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">He has one requirement.</span></i> <i><span style="">If Phantom doesn&#x2019;t appear in front of him within 30 minutes, he will kill the hostages one by one.</span></i> <i><span style="">Phantom.</span></i> <i><span style="">Are you seeing this now?</span></i> <i><span style="">The lives of the hostages depends on you.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such a thing should be left to the police and SWAT team, but why was he looking for Tae-hyuk?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I shouldn&#x2019;t ignore the request for help?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought about what Viviana said once again.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is more tteokbokki in the pot if you run out. I have something to see to, so I will go out for a while.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk left the orphanage before pulling out the opera mask and putting it on his head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know who the killer was, but Tae-hyuk wanted to meet him.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, the price would never be cheap.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
