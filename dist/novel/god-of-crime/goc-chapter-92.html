<p><span style="">Chapter 92 - Big Brother&#x2019;s Raid #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho felt great.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha! Drink, drink! I will pay for it today!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can Sunbae really do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">ABS Station&#x2019;s AD, Kwon Joon-hyuk, pulled the girl sitting next to him closer to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aish, what is Oppa doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shin Se-ho PD... No, this news department head will treat you! Let&#x2019;s drink!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Alcohol was consumed and the girl&#x2019;s breaths smelled of alcohol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The waiter came over with bottles of alcohol and fruit snacks. T</span><span style="">here was already beer on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the appetizing snacks were placed down.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Beer service!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A female extended some bomb shots to Shin Se-ho and Kwon Joon-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho gulped it down with a red face and a breath that was stinking of alcohol.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kwon Joon-hyuk! What did I say? Didn&#x2019;t I say to trust in and follow Hyung?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho had been on the rise after revealing the secret hobbies of domestic conglomerates.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Soon after, he revealed the truth about the hippo case that the police had been trying to conceal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That alone was tremendous.</span></p><p><span style="">Usually, PDs only reported exclusive scoops once or twice a year.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Shin Se-ho had several jackpots successively.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There was an exclusive interview with Phantom. How did you get that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll just say it here. I&#x2019;m close to Phantom., so if I call him, then he will come running right away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho worked as a PD at ABS Station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a PD, he had to follow most general events.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It had been two years since he started stalking detectives in order to get a scoop.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He finally got recognized due to meeting Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I was originally going to try other stations, but the chief held my leg and asked for me to remain at ABS Station.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kya! As expected from Shin Se-ho hyung-nim! Now the world recognizes Hyung-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho laughed at the compliments and ate the fruit snacks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His title at the station was PD, but now he was promoted up two levels.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Starting today, he was a Chief Producer, a CP, not a PD.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The CP managed the PDs, and was in charge of the total production of the broadcasts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It could be said that his position would be equivalent to a general executive at other companies.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I can also use the corporate card that wasn&#x2019;t available in my PD days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho waved a luxurious gold-plated credit card that was held between his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwon Joon-hyuk hadn&#x2019;t heard the contents of the deal between Shin Se-ho and Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why had Phantom given Shin Se-ho the right to interview him?&#xA0;</span><span style="">He asked Shin Se-ho, who replied,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you crazy? Do you think I will cut the belly of the duck laying the golden eggs?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a female grabbed Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oppa. Let&#x2019;s sing. I want to hear 18 Times.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The two people went on stage and started singing a slow blues song.</span></p><p><span style="">Kwon Joon-hyuk licked his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Such a person was now the chief producer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He started to worry about the future of ABS Station.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, I don&apos;t know. Today is a day to play! Now, let&#x2019;s go and sing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwon Joon-hyuk put an arm around a woman&#x2019;s shoulders and walked towards the stage.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the door opened and a man in a sharp suit entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had such a strong physique that he could be in an action movie right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho, who was playing with the female, turned and looked at the man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? I didn&#x2019;t call for the waiter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man, who was mistaken as a waiter, looked around the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are you Shin Se-ho?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The unpleasant pronunciation showed that he wasn&#x2019;t familiar with Korean.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, that is me. Did rumors about me already circulate? I am a bit famous. Huhu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho felt proud and took out a 50,000 won bill from his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Can you buy me a pack of cigarettes? Marlboro red. You can keep the remaining change as a tip.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The man... no, Big Brother laughed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He pulled out the Tokarev TT-33 and aimed it at Shin Se-ho&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It seems like I&#x2019;ve come to the right place. The tip is for your life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother quietly closed the door and entered.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The people inside screamed until their throats were sore.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was a place with good soundproofing so the screams didn&#x2019;t escape outside.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">There were a few reasons why Big Brother chose the karaoke bar as the place to keep the hostages. (In Korea: a karaoke bar has girls working working there, sort of like an escort bar)</span></p><p><span style="">It sold alcohol, snacks and other illegal things.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, CCTV were installed everywhere to avoid a police crackdown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were devices installed inside the room and the structure outside was unknown.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Instead was like a maze with multiple random passages.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a fortress that didn&#x2019;t allow enemy penetration.</span></p><p><span style="">There were 30 hostages in the room, including Shin Se-ho and Kwon Joon-hyuk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of them were employees and girls working at the karaoke bar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Unfortunately, some students who used the convenience store on the first floor were also trembling among the adults.</span></p><p><span style="">One young man whispered to another.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you hear? If Phantom doesn&#x2019;t show up, then he will kill the hostages one by one... Before that, we have to neutralize him somehow.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Even if he has guns, aren&#x2019;t we more numerous? I think we can neutralize him if we strike at the same time but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think there will be good enough odds if 10 people join together.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I agree.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Me too.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother hadn&#x2019;t tied up the hostages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was just blocking the entrance so that no one could leave the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The hostages were talking so low that Big Brother couldn&#x2019;t hear them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would jump from four directions at the same time, suppressing the opponent and taking his guns.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was better to risk one&#x2019;s life fighting than to die one by one.</span></p><p><span style="">On the right, the man who decided to strike Big Brother was anxious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among the hostages here, there were many men working as waiters, their numbers reaching more than 10 people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">How confident was that person in his ability that he didn&#x2019;t even tie them up?</span></p><p><span style="">Still, they would just die at Big Brother&#x2019;s hand if time kept passing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, he would rather risk his life to fight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The determined man bit his lip.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He nodded towards the other hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">Someone counted down in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;3... 2... 1... Pounce!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A dozen people instantly jumped towards Big Brother.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They lowered their bodies as much as possible and focused on making it difficult for the opponent to hit them with his gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother held the gun in one hand and slowly opened his eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t seem confused at all by the hostages&#x2019; actions.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are a lot of people so killing a few hostages should be okay.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother rotated his body and kicked one of the hostages.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Keok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He then turned and pulled the trigger at the men who were trying to do a back tackle.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tang!</span></i> <i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuheok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A man was shot in the leg and rolled across the floor.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On his right, the man who tried to jump Big Brother was shot in the head.</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did you wonder why I didn&#x2019;t tie you up? The reason is simple. Even 100 of you lowlives wouldn&#x2019;t be able to beat me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aaaaack!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">One waiter took a knife and attacked Big Brother from a blind spot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The knife struck Big Brother&#x2019;s chest and the waiter shouted loudly,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hahaha! I did it. My attack...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother casually looked back and fired his gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It pierced the waiter&#x2019;s waist precisely.</span></p><p><span style="">The hostages started to feel despair.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but your attacks won&#x2019;t work on me while I&#x2019;m wearing this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Big Brother took off his suit and showed the trembling hostages.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a reinforced suit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he was wearing black armor.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;B-Body armour...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He wore a reinforced suit made of Kevlar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Special products made of those fibers were used in various bulletproof shirts.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He wore it around his whole body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if it was hard to move, the ability to protect the body was enormous.</span></p><p><span style="">Furthermore, the rubbery black fibres on the outside were Nomex.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a special fiber used for firefighting clothing, as it had great heat resistance and electrical insulation.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he couldn&#x2019;t be hurt, even if he was attacked with a stun gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only downside was that it felt like an extra 20kg of weight was on the body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same as wearing huge sandbags on the body.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Being able to move like that while wearing this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had handled 10 hostages in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh... Ahhhhh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The remaining people could only scream.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother knocked on his suit and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If you want to knock me down while wearing this, you should bring an anti-tank rocket.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kwon Joon-hyuk, who was hiding among the hostages, groaned.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he spoke to the injured Shin Se-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho had several bullets in his shoulders and thighs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Despite that, he didn&#x2019;t give Phantom&#x2019;s contact details.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, Big Brother took hostages and made an announcement to the police.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">If Phantom doesn&#x2019;t come here within 30 minutes then I will kill the hostages one by one.</span></i></p><p><span style="">This was the condition that Big Brother gave to the police.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;D-Department Head... Do you really not know Phantom&#x2019;s contact details?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eu.... euhhh.... I said I don&#x2019;t know...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You said you were friends!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho had no words to say and could only bite his lips.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Big Brother didn&#x2019;t seem to believe him but what he said was real.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The relationship with Phantom was only one way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Shin Se-ho couldn&#x2019;t do anything unless he was contacted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Shin Se-ho called out Phantom&#x2019;s name in his pain-filled state.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Would Phantom come here to save him and the hostages?</span></p><p><span style="">If he did, Phantom wasn&#x2019;t just a criminal...</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk arrived at the scene to find the neighborhood completely sealed off by police and soldiers.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No... I told him to release the hostages. Block it off completely to stop anyone from entering.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The soldiers were the 35th Battalion of the Capital Defense Command.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had encountered them during the Bomber case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were a special unit specialization in street warfare and counterterrorism, but now they were just blocking off the road.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I have to somehow enter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He could go up to the police.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-I am Phantom.</span></i> <i><span style="">From now on, I will plunge into enemy territory!</span></i></p><p><span style="">That wouldn&#x2019;t happen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible for an average person to get past that surveillance and enter, but it was possible for Tae-hyuk who had the crime skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Then let&#x2019;s use my newly acquired skill.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">First of all, he used Counterfeit to change his leather jacket into a soldier uniform.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he use Disguise to get the face of Sergeant Kim Ha-sae who he met several times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Demon Revealing Mirror showed that he had become a completely different person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;There is a bit of height difference. Was he originally taller due to his combat boots?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk approached a soldier who formed part of the blockade.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The road is fully sealed off, and not even a single ant will be able to enter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Jong-sa, who was maintaining the barrier, looked at Tae-hyuk and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sergeant Kim. Didn&#x2019;t I tell you to make a barrier on the roof? Why did you come down here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t panic and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The captain asked me to check the blockade.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In this situation, it was good to borrow the name of the boss.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was even better if they were a very high ranking person that couldn&#x2019;t be questioned.</span></p><p><span style="">Sergeant Park pointed inside with his thumb.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a quick signal telling him to go inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then keep up the good work. Charge!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Park Jong-sa clicked his tongue as he saw Tae-hyuk saluting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aigoo, look at that salute. This is a real situation. He should go back to basic training.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had a moment of silence for Kim Ha-sae before moving to the back of the karaoke bar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The killer is sent by the Triads.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was obviously that the opponent would possess a great deal of firepower that he couldn&#x2019;t deal with.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk wouldn&#x2019;t be able to fight him with the Violence skill and iron pipe.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But for weak people, there is a weak way of fighting.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Five minutes later, Counterfeit was released and his leather jacket was restored.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the phantom mask from his pocket and placed it on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom and Big Brother.</span></p><p><span style="">The two criminals&#x2019; fight was about to start.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
