It kept returning to his pocket, yet it wasn&#x2019;t a possessed doll.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It just informed him of the situation through messages and vibrations. It didn&#x2019;t like seem like it would do him any harm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;I guess I should go visit a shaman later.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He put aside the mirror for now, and decided to think about Yoo Cheol-ho first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Wasn&#x2019;t Yoo Cheol-ho hiding in an empty church?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">If he had a smartphone, then he would search with a map app service. However, Tae-hyuk currently only had the flip phone that his sister had given him.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had no choice but to go to a nearby PC room to search online.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Despite the fact that it was currently class time, the PC room was still crowded with people.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He noticed a few students in their uniforms.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;They are also playing hooky.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk paid the fee at the counter, then sat down and turned on the computer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;The location of the church... Crazy. There are more than 20?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The good news was that he knew that it was an empty church. Tae-hyuk called the churches one by one to check.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After a few minutes, he was able to get the information that he wanted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;There were two churches that didn&#x2019;t answer the phone. He is certainly in one of them!&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk moved in a hurry.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The first place he went to wasn&#x2019;t correct.

However, he felt a strange presence inside.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The whole alley was half empty due to redevelopment. The church where Yoo Cheol-ho was hiding also seemed to be ruined.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Certainly, no one would ever imagine that an escaped prisoner would be hiding in a run down church.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">First of all, he had to confirm that Yoo Cheol-ho was inside.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;How can I talk to him?&apos;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He couldn&#x2019;t knock on the door and ask for Yoo Cheol-ho ssi. It just wasn&#x2019;t possible.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At that moment, he came up with a good idea.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk got the address of the church from the mailbox and headed to a Chinese restaurant that was nearby.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a place where he used to do deliveries when skipping school.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was lunch time. The phone was ringing, but the delivery motorcycles weren&#x2019;t visible.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;As expected, they are swamped with orders.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk called the Chinese restaurant.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He made an order for jajangmyeon and gave the address of the church. He also made sure to sound annoyed at the fact that the restaurant was swamped with orders, and that the delivery would be delayed.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Uh, is it Tae-hyuk? Did you come for a job again? Well, that is good, as there are a lot of deliveries.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The boss greeted Tae-hyuk as he opened the door to the Chinese restaurant.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Nope. I&#x2019;m here to eat jajangmyeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aye, don&#x2019;t be like that. I&#x2019;m unbelievably busy right now, please, just do 10! It is urgent so I&#x2019;ll give you an hourly wage of 10,000 won.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk smiled pleasantly.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then I&#x2019;ll do it for just one hour.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Call!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk changed into his work clothes and picked up the iron boxes containing the deliveries.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;Let&#x2019;s do a test.&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He decided to test if the Robbery skill he just learnt could also be used against the public.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As he passed the boss sitting at the counter, Tae-hyuk bumped against his body.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then the crime skill was activated normally.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-You have succeeded in stealing the opponent&#x2019;s belongings!</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;What did I steal?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a strange bundle of hair.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;What is this?&#x2019;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He looked at the boss and saw that his rich head of hair was gone.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Boss-nim...

When was this stripped off? T-Tae-hyuk... Don&#x2019;t tell anybody about this. I&#x2019;ll add another 5,000 won to your hourly wage.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The two men exchanged conspiratorial glances.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">* &#xA0; &#xA0; * &#xA0; &#xA0; *</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Your Jajangmyeon has arrived!&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk knocked on the firmly locked door and shouted.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was no reaction from inside the church. He started using more strength to knock on the door.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was still no reaction, so Tae-hyuk started shouting.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aish! Delivery! Please come out quickly!&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the end, the person couldn&#x2019;t bear it.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The closed curtain opened a little bit. The person inside was checking to see if it really was a genuine Chinese delivery person outside.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The iron door opened, revealing a man in clergy attire that could be seen from within the shadows.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I never ordered any jajangmyeon.&#x201D;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Aish!
