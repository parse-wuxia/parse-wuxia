<p><span style="">Chapter 25: Power Deployment #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">As the proficiency of the Forgery skill went over 20, it became impossible to increase the skill any further just by watching Big Mama work.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was distressed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I think I have reached 100 proficiency...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like he now had to practice directly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The necessary tools were purchased, so the problem now was the location.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it hard to do it in Big Mama&#x2019;s store?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to show his skill to Big Mama.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t do it at home.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A bunch of chemicals were needed, and he couldn&#x2019;t risk the health of his family.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Where is a suitable space? Preferably a well-ventilated space... It is better if I have some artwork to copy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The best option was to have his own studio, but that required time and money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He might have a chance to get another skill. He wanted to progress at a rapid pace.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The right space... ah!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He knew a great place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why didn&#x2019;t I think of the art room?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was equipped with everything Tae-hyuk needed.</span></p><p><span style="">The only problem was that he was currently suspended.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Well, it isn&#x2019;t a problem if I obtain a school uniform and pretend to be a transfer student.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">B High School was near Big Mama&#x2019;s store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a big school with over 1,000 students. </span><span style="">They were the optimal conditions for hiding.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made sure he had money in his wallet and rushed to the clothing store.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could buy a used uniform, but if he wanted to pretend to be a transfer student, it was better to get a new one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was expensive, but he still had some money left over from catching Park Sung-kwang.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Think of it as an investment.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As he opened the door, he saw a man reading a newspaper.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked around the store where various uniforms were hanging and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to buy a uniform.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The owner took a look at Tae-hyuk and replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Female uniforms aren&#x2019;t for sale.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I&#x2019;m going to wear it.&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re going to wear a female school uniform?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he introduced himself as a transfer student, and was finally able to receive a proper response.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Why is it so hard to buy a uniform! Treating somebody like a criminal!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Well, technically, he was a criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">After purchasing the uniform, Tae-hyuk went to buy the other tools.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It didn&#x2019;t matter what type of artwork it was, the rise in proficiency was similar.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to decide on something that was easier than forging sculptures or ceramics.</span></p><p><span style="">Eventually, Tae-hyuk decided on painting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;My training will begin earnestly tomorrow!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyes burned with the fires of enthusiasm.</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Since a few days ago, Tae-hyuk started having dinner at home.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like his body would be unable to hold on if he continued to eat Eun-young&#x2019;s food.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An Eun-young was disappointed when she found out that Tae-hyuk had already eaten.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why?</span></p><p><span style="">When Tae-hyuk arrived home, an unexpected guest greeted him. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk is home.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kang-suk hyung!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Kang-suk was setting out the meal on the table.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He recently became quite close to Ha-ran, and thus came here to eat.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk asked when he saw Kang-suk&#x2019;s pale complexion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&apos;s going on? You look pretty tired.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s been pretty busy lately. I couldn&#x2019;t eat rice, so I came over when Ha-ran invited me to dinner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see. Did a case happen nearby?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, there is something like that. It is something that isn&#x2019;t very good. At any rate, be careful when you walk around at night.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I should go pick up Noona when you go home from work.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That isn&#x2019;t necessary!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then why did you say to be careful?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;ll go pick her up!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.</span></p><p><span style="">Well, it was difficult for passion to heat up.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk scratched his head and blushed as he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But, I heard you were suspended?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. How did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha! Don&apos;t be too embarrassed. It isn&#x2019;t a big deal. I&#x2019;m also...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk started to talk about his school days.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hands clenched into a fist as he heard about the part where Kang-suk fought 17:1.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, these type of stories were exaggerated.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it was really possible if it was Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wouldn&#x2019;t be strange for people to fall down when hit by a thick forearm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Above all, the description was very real.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I wished I had a combat skill rather than something strange like Robbery. However, why is there no combat skill?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was going to try out the Forgery skill.</span></p><p><span style="">With that in mind, he started eating the dinner that Ha-ran had prepared.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, he had an ominous feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was really busy.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t respond when asked for the reason.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe...</span></p><p><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be?</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I think it is the perfect plan!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a satisfied expression as he stared at the tools that he had prepared on the desk in the art room.</span></p><p><span style="">He had passed a considerable number of people on the way here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, no one noticed that Tae-hyuk wasn&#x2019;t a student of B High School.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He only occasionally heard &#x2018;was there such a thug in this school?&#x2019; as people walked past. </span><span style="">It felt a bit unpleasant, but it wasn&#x2019;t too big of a big problem.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hah... There seems to be self-study in this school at night.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">So there was no one in the art room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could work here for two hours.</span></p><p><span style="">After that, he had to go to An Eun-young&#x2019;s house.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then, shall I begin?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He shone the Demon Revealing Mirror on a landscape painting in the art room.</span></p><p><span style="">[Forgery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Analyzing the specified artwork. </span></p><p><span style="">[Practice Landscape Painting]</span></p><p><span style="">-A landscape painted to improve the painting skill.</span></p><p><span style="">-The detailed information is hidden because the rating is too low.</span></p><p><span style="">-Tools needed: Paper, pigment, color, soluble oil...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;The rating?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">At first, he thought it was a painting that wasn&#x2019;t too big of a big deal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were restrictions due to the rating.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;If I want to use the skill properly, then I&#x2019;ll have to raise the rating.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">In order to do that, he had to learn the Forgery skill quickly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After analyzing and collecting the items specified by the skill, he moved his body.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, uh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The brush in his right hand started to move over the canvas.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like it was possessed!</span></p><p><span style="">He received a notification on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">[The quality of the artwork is lower than your dexterity.]</span></p><p><span style="">[You have perfectly copied the painting!]</span></p><p><span style="">[Proficiency will rise rapidly!]</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk could perfectly paint the landscape, despite his dexterity only being 30 points.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk admired the finished painting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah... Isn&#x2019;t it really the same thing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The performance of the Forgery skill was amazing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the original wasn&#x2019;t framed, then it was impossible to tell which one was genuine.</span></p><p><span style="">There was one big difference.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The landscape painting was displayed in the art room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since it was a space used by many people, there were traces of the hands that touched it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He moved it until it was the same.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Now, no one would notice if he walked out with the original.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... I need to learn it as soon as possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He checked and his proficiency increased by one.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At this speed, he would be able to raise it by 2~3 more points today.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk made a satisfied face as he looked for the next piece to be copied.</span></p><p><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Rustle!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk heard a strange sound and looked around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;... What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva. Someone was watching.</span></p><p><span style="">He had memorized the structure of the school since he was sneaking in.</span></p><p><span style="">The art room was located in the special activities building, and students studying in the main building wouldn&#x2019;t come here.</span></p><p><span style="">Who...?</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt sweat flowing down.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, the window is open?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had confirmed that they were all closed when entering the art room. </span><span style="">However, now one was open.</span></p><p><span style="">It meant one thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Someone was watching me work!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wasn&#x2019;t the only uninvited guest in B High School.</span></p><p><span style="">There was one more...</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="">* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;* &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk heard the call through his walkie-talkie and exclaimed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;W-h-a-t! A second body was found?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes, that&#x2019;s right.</span></i> <i><span style="">Please contact Inspector-nim.</span></i> <i><span style="">Come to the incident site!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The state of the corpse was the same as the first incident.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an act by the same person.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, the thing he was concerned about happened.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk bit his lip, causing blood to flow into his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t care about it right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk punched the wall.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a loud </span><i><span style="">bang </span></i><span style="">sound, and it seemed like he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to endure.</span></p><p><span style="">The &#x2018;watering hippo&#x2019; murderer had occurred again.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk started the car and asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Where? I&apos;ll go right now. Seal the area so that not even one ant can escape!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The answer was heard on the walkie-talkie.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-A warehouse not far from B High School.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There again?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The first body was discovered in a place not far from there.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Send me the exact location.&quot;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Understood.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will catch that hippo. Just wait, Kang-suk hyung is coming.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk slammed on the car&#x2019;s accelerator.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
