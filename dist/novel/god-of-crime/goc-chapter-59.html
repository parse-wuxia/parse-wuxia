<p><span style="">Chapter 59: It seems like something is going on #1 &#xA0;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk finished his shower and looked in the mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could see a half-naked man with a rotten smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Did I look that bad?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, he didn&#x2019;t have a good impression of his looks in the past.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, now he felt like he went beyond the &#x2018;not bad&#x2019; level.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It feels like more characteristics have arrived. Surely it isn&#x2019;t a side effect of the crime skill...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he gained more crime skills, Seo Tae-hyuk became aware of his stats.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was directly reflected on his body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As intelligence rose, his brain became better, while as agility went up, he could move faster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Perhaps the crime skills affected his appearance as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Aish, it can&#x2019;t be.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled as refreshingly as possible, forcing out the freshness.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The mirror showed a miraculous reflection of how much effort he put in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmm hmm. Handsome.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like he looked the most wonderful after having a shower.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at himself with satisfied eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He himself was aware that his personality had changed considerably from the past.</span></p><p><span style="">He was doing this because he was now going to meet Yoo Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were going out to play, but it was technically a date.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to maintain the basic courtesies.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well. Noona helped me out this time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smashed the Death Circus exactly 70 hours ago.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition to that, he got two blacklist members and a huge 20 affinity points.</span></p><p><span style="">[Current affinity points in possession: 20]</span></p><p><span style="">Just seeing it caused a smile to appear on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">He gained points if he managed to establish a relationship with a person he didn&#x2019;t know in his past life, or if he saved someone who should&#x2019;ve died.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he got 20 points at once.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It meant that Kim Joon-young and Choi Sung-yeol killed a lot of people in the future.</span></p><p><span style="">As they were caught, the atrocities of the Death Circus became known throughout the country.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The shocking thing was that dozens of chaebols were involved in the case.</span></p><p><span style="">Like hyenas finding rotten meat, the media started biting at them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Wouldn&#x2019;t it be a case that shakes the country for a whole month?</span></p><p><span style="">After finishing his shower, Tae-hyuk wore his now trademark leather jacket and skinny jeans.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They weren&#x2019;t clothes suitable for a date with a woman.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled with satisfaction and left his house.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The plan was simple.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First, they would eat likely before stopping at a marine theme park for a few hours.</span></p><p><span style="">The two people were eating at a restaurant that Tae-hyuk had previously reserved.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, Ha-yang&#x2019;s expression was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the first time he had seen her look like this.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spoke as he ate spicy pork stir-fry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh, Noona. You don&#x2019;t like spicy pork stir-fry? Then you can buy something else. There are many things </span></p><p><span style="">on the menu here. I am paying, so you can eat at will.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then she shook her head with a flustered expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. It&#x2019;s the first time I&#x2019;ve been here. Wah... You can have the side dishes. Let&#x2019;s go to the amusement park after eating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The place where the two people were eating was a branch store selling kimbap for 1,500 won.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were dozens of dishes sold at low prices, so it was Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s main restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="">Come to think of it, Yoo Ha-yang was a chaebol.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She wasn&#x2019;t well-matched with common places like this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk felt sorry at that moment.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang had been a big help in solving the Death Circus case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In particular, he was able to secure information about the guests with her ability.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to reward her with a more luxurious restaurant?</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;But I don&#x2019;t have the money.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He could barely afford the theme park admission fee.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk earned over 100 million not long ago at the casino.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, rumours of a subway being built near his house were circulating and the price of the house had increased by 60%.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also the living expenses and school expenses for his brother and sister.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, he didn&#x2019;t make any money.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why he had to catch one or two more people like Yoo Cheol-ho.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Furthermore, he didn&#x2019;t earn one cent from the Death Circus.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rather, he had to spend money for Moonlight Flower to enter the masquerade party.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally a deficit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ohh. This is really dangerous. First, I need to get some money.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was possible if he used the Gambling and Forgery skills in the right way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If so, what should he choose?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It needed to be a low-risk and high-return method.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He needed to seriously consider this.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The two people ended their meal and went to the newly opened marine theme park.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was an amusement park that was a combination of an aquarium and an amusement park.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! I wanted to come here!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang enjoyed the trip like a middle school student on a field trip.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what do you want to see?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Dolphins!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">At the moment, Tae-hyuk remembered that the hippo incident had taken place at an aquarium.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a completely different place from here, but he couldn&#x2019;t help but think about it when he saw the water tanks filled with water.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Eeit! I&#x2019;ve been hanging around criminals too much. I just want to relax today. What could possibly happen?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk thought and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">Then why?</span></p><p><span style="">He had an ominous feeling that something was going to happen.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that time, Tae-hyuk heard the conversation of a couple passing by.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did you see today&#x2019;s news? A huge number of chaebols were arrested for watching a slaughter show.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I did! At first I thought I was watching the ad for a new movie!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then did you know that there was a man who saved those who were captured? They were all people who would&#x2019;ve died, but he used his great abilities to lead them to escape.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wow, great! So what happened to him? Did he receive any commendation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No. The person who saved them suddenly disappeared.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! How perfect! What is his identity? An FBI agent?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The couple didn&#x2019;t know that the person they were talking about was right next to them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-yang heard their conversation and paused,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, over here! He is actually he... Oof!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk blocked Ha-yang&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;N-Noona. You shouldn&#x2019;t say that!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Ah. Indeed. Sorry. But Tae-hyuk saved everyone. The fact that no one knows this...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk answered with a small sigh.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona knows. Isn&#x2019;t that good enough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Ha-yang smiled widely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used all types of illegal activities to catch criminals, so if he got caught by the police then he would be handcuffed, not rewarded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would also repeat the same thing until he was promoted to the Noble rank.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had 12 people left to catch on his blacklist before he could be promoted to Noble.</span></p><p><span style="">Before that, he absolutely couldn&#x2019;t go out into the spotlight.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a need to be as careful as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I shouldn&#x2019;t expose my face now.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t uncomfortable.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would take advantage of it to make a profit.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips and looked at the huge water tank in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The escalator they were riding passed the tanks towards the basement.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place where the dolphin show was being held was the fourth underground floor.</span></p><p><span style="">The Atlantis Theme Park was a huge dome shaped building, and various rides could be enjoyed on the ground.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The building was over 30 metres tall, so it was incredible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The marine park, which extended all the way to the fourth basement floor, was very popular because it gave the feeling of being under the sea.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk got off the escalator and looked around.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were huge tanks holding thousands of tons of water.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was shaped like a donut, and the audience could see various sea creatures in the hole in the middle.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk, look at that! Moray. It looks exactly like you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We&#x2019;re completely different!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth twitched.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked just like the fish passing by him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But what happens if all of this breaks?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Ha-yang tapped the water tanks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was very thick, but she still had a hazy expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahaha. There is no need to worry.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A female guide wearing a uniform approached the worried Ha-yang.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ha-yang replied with shining eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Our Atlantis Aquarium boasts an extraordinary water tank made of a special acrylic that has ultra-fine fibres of 90cm in thickness. It can withstand a water pressure of 500,000 tons, and won&#x2019;t break, even when shot.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-I see! Then I can look around with confidence!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is natural to feel uneasy. But don&#x2019;t worry. As long as a bomb explodes in front of it, the tanks absolutely won&#x2019;t break.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is the middle of the city so there is no need to worry about bombs. Right Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang smiled at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Seo Tae-hyuk?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But Tae-hyuk was muttering something with a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Water Theme Park Atlantis. The super large tanks...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-yang tilted her head to one side. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Tae-hyuk still seemed to be thinking of something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cracked, collapsed, submerged... The cause was a bomb explosion!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk managed to remember.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Atlantis suffered a tremendous accident half a year after it was opened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The water tanks in front of him were destroyed and the entire underground area submerged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hundreds of people died and it was a huge disaster.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t a mere accident, but a bomb attack.</span></p><p><span style="">The culprit...</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Bomber Kim Tae-sung!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the guide with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She would know the exact fact.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How long has it been since the first opening?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Obviously, if his memory was correct, a tremendous disaster would occur here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It also wasn&#x2019;t too far in the future.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe this was the source of his ominous feeling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The guide kindly gave an explanation of the history of Atlantis.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. Three years ago, the Water Theme Park Atlantis started...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk cut in and stopped a long story.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So when did you open?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, yes! As of today, it is 91 days. Why do you want to know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is three months. Huu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk sighed with relief.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Did something happen? That reminds me, you said something about a collapse. What relation...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyway, it was going to happen three months later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he spoke now then he would be called a fraud.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, nothing. Just a mobile game story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it is like that! At any rate, what you see in front of you is called the Milky Way of the sea...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The guide started explaining as she descended the escalator.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Other guests were listening to the story as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But something was wrong.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The disaster would happen three months later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew the criminal was a blacklist member so he would be able to stop it from happening but that uneasy feeling didn&#x2019;t disappear.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was like he had closed his eyes and was walking towards the edge of a cliff.</span></p><p><span style="">This feeling became clearer every second.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was at that moment.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Biiiik!</span></i></p><p><span style="">Unlike usual, the Demon Revealing Mirror started vibrating violently.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed to be a warning.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk projected the screen of the Demon Revealing Mirror in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">[Caution!]</span></p><p><span style="">-The Spying skill has detected a danger.</span></p><p><span style="">-The special ability has been triggered and 20 affinity points have been reduced.</span></p><p><span style="">-Amount of time remaining until Atlantis collapses:</span></p><p><span style="">-00:00:29&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk trembled as he saw the message in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">20 affinity points had disappeared in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But the danger was right in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk stopped thinking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First, he had to move to as safe a spot as possible to avoid this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Noona. You trust me right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? Yes?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then run! From here...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The time was dwindling as the two people talked.</span></p><p><span style="">27 seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">26 seconds...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He grabbed the wrist of Yoo Ha-yang and the guide and started running.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, G-Guest-nim! If you act like this here...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have time to explain! Escape right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? All of a sudden, what...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gritted his teeth.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk activated the Violence skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">People were watching, but he couldn&#x2019;t afford to worry about that.</span></p><p><span style="">[You have activated the Violence skill.]</span></p><p><span style="">-Muscle strength and agility are strengthened.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Tae-hyuk was holding a long iron pipe in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">And he ran.</span></p><p><span style="">If he stayed here any longer, then he would be crushed by the falling tanks.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk started to run towards the point where the escalator ended, holding both people&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><p><span style="">-00:00:01&#x2019; &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">There was the sound of a huge explosion.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
