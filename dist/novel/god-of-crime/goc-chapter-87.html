<p><span style="">Chapter 87 - Genius and Genius #3</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho&#x2019;s eyes shone as he saw the new manager of the school club.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? You&#x2019;re the manager? Weren&#x2019;t you a freshman?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That was four years ago. At any rate, I called all the members after hearing that Sunbae-nim was coming. We can listen to the vivid scene directly from the mouth of someone on the industry... Kuheok...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are more people?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yep!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Three of them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But this year, I am one of them...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was curious that this club was still alive.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In fact, today I brought a candidate. Unfortunately, she left because there was a problem at home. Still, she&#x2019;ll definitely accept this place. Perhaps she&#x2019;ll join after being admitted?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wah. Thank you, Sunbae-nim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho looked at the club that was filled with memories of his university days.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As a mystery club, the bookshelves were filled with mystery novels.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, John Dickson Carr, and so on.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of the novels were classics.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Due to this place, I was called a genius investigator.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Praising yourself in this situation! Sunbae-nim is wonderful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho pulled out a small envelop and held it out.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you not getting proper support? Add this to supplement your budget.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heok... T-Thank you. Attention! Salute towards Sunbae-nim!:</span></p><p><span style="">The members stood up and bowed towards Joo Hyun-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, Sunbae-nim!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, I don&#x2019;t want to lose this place where I have some fond memories of Kang-suk sunbae.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A woman, who heard Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s murmur, asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is that who Sunbae-nim won the mafia game with?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, it has been seven years but someone still remembers.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course! I saw it and became interesting in deduction! Whoa, whoa. In this type of place, the best stars of the mafia game...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huhu. Do you want my signature?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes! Please!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mafia Game was the name of a popular TV entertainment program a few years ago where the contestants were divided into police or mafia and played a variety of reasoning games.&#xA0;</span><span style="">National MC&#x2019;s with an IQ of 150, comedians, politicians, etc. were all contestants.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were hundreds of participants, started from broadcasters to ordinary people.</span></p><p><span style="">After Joo Hyun-ho won it twice, he was called the genius of deduction.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even now when he was an investigator, he would recall that experience and sometimes a flash of inspiration would come.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So there was a connection like this. It was a vivid scene for a club junior...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he received a call from Kim Do-shik.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho had been planning to tell his juniors some exciting stories.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This was my only vacation. Indeed, if I&#x2019;m not present then there is no investigation. Excuse me while I take this call.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho pressed the call button on the phone as he left the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he heard Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s agitated voice,</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Investigator Joo Hyun-ho.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;m sorry to call on your day off.</span></i> <i><span style="">But aren&#x2019;t you at S Univeristy right now?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha. Inspector. This isn&#x2019;t like you. It hasn&#x2019;t even been a day and yet...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Stop joking.</span></i> <i><span style="">At any rate, if you are at S University then go to the museum there.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Has something happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Do you know the Rubens painting there?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I was just looking at it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">There is a chance that the painting is a forgery.</span></i> <i><span style="">I arrested a Russian smuggler this morning and many Rubens paintings were found.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;m not sure yet so I wanted you to go and see if there is anything suspicious.</span></i> <i><span style="">Can&#x2019;t you read them using human psychology?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho&#x2019;s eyes sharpened.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think it will be hard for me alone. It isn&#x2019;t my area of expertise.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">An expert will soon arrive on the scene.</span></i> <i><span style="">I don&#x2019;t have a warrant yet so just talk to people.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">You can hear the details from the expert.</span></i> <i><span style="">Then do your best.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho sighed as Kim Do-shik hung up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a place where he was meeting his club juniors after a long time, yet there was a new case.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Art forgery...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">His heart started to beat faster at the thought of meeting his rival.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Can I call you Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk replied while blindfolding Kim Hyun-do,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s talk comfortably.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand. Why are my eyes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t worry too much. It is just a safety device. It will be tiresome if there is some trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The tuxedo suit that Tae-hyuk was wearing now had been made using his leather jacket and Counterfeit.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It would last exactly 300 seconds.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was impossible to make something else with it using the Forgery skill, so no matter how fast he used the skill, he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to prevent his clothes from suddenly changing.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Originally, I wanted to finish this in five minutes. But it seems like the situation is more complicated than I thought.</span></p><p><span style="">He sent a message to An Eun-young using his phone.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A reply came back in less than 10 seconds.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hmm, I suddenly had to go home so I will be leaving first.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;m really sorry.</span></i></p><p><span style="">Fortunately, it seemed possible to investigate the imitation art without a time limit.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I want to ask Director something. The Rubens painting displayed here is a fake, a finely crafted fake. Do you know anything about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That can&#x2019;t be. The exhibition here is scheduled to be displayed for two months with the cooperation of the Hermitage Museum in Russia... Surely there wouldn&#x2019;t be anything wrong?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk had wondered if Kim Hyun-do was Red Mafia&#x2019;s accomplice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was suspicious because there was no publicity, despite displaying one of Rubens works.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was as if he didn&#x2019;t want a lot of guests here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked around the director&#x2019;s room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could see the personality of the person by looking at their room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, the room was very tidy.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The broom in the corner indicated he cleaned it directly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;A very neat and meticulous person.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he noticed a book that was on the desk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It turned out to be A Dog of Flanders, a book where Rubens&#x2019; painting appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk went through the desk and found some additional clues.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the calendar, there was a museum schedule written by Kim Hyun-do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;He is inviting kindergarten and elementary school children nearby to see the painting for free.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">By default, the art museum belonged to S University and operated with the aid of the university.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;His financial status is also clean. This means...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Considering all the information, Kim Hyun-do was very sincere in operating this museum.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk finally said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You like A Dog of Flanders.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. It has been my favourite novel since I was a child. I applied to be the director of an art museum before I wanted to make other children feel the same emotions. Fortunately, I was able to acquire a Rubens painting for this museum... I was so excited that I couldn&#x2019;t sleep properly for several days.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was the reason why he had been dozing off.</span></p><p><span style="">With this, Tae-hyuk was convinced that Kim Hyun-do wasn&#x2019;t related to Red Mafia.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he was wrong&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;No. I trust my judgement. Director Kim Hyun-do isn&#x2019;t a criminal.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk released Kim Hyun-do&#x2019;s blindfold.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How long until the other guards return?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There are around 20 minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then I&#x2019;ll finish it before that. First, let&#x2019;s take a look at the Rubens painting.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You didn&#x2019;t come to blow this place up?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you. I came to help you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do was still confused.</span></p><p><span style="">The man called Phantom wasn&#x2019;t a simple criminal.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The two people headed to where the Rubens painting was displayed.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Looking again, it really is well-made. The parchment it is drawn on is actually more than 500 years old. It really looks like an old masterpiece, but I would like to take a closer look.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For the sake of a perfect masterpiece, a craftsman with considerable ability would have suffered for a few months to create this, so of course they would feel attached to it. Then they will play a joke.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t understand what you mean.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how he looked, he couldn&#x2019;t find any differences.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Look at this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled red sunglasses out of his pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">When he used it, hidden initials showed up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heok... Don&apos;t tell me...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">In the painting, some Chinese characters were hidden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was written with special ink that could only be seen through red glasses.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I doubt that Rubens would&#x2019;ve learned this language. Do you know that that means?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This was a very sophisticated forgery.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rubens paintings were extremely expensive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He left behind more than 2,000 works in his lifetime. Even so, he was still one of the most popular artists when it came to auctions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Rubens&#x2019; works had one of the best records at the famous auction house Sotherby&#x2019;s. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then what should I do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk tried to figure out the purpose by combining his knowledge of the future actions of Red Mafia.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe they are preparing for a huge scam. Then let&#x2019;s return to your office to talk more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know when the other guards would return.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The situation would become complicated if he was discovered by others.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk and Kim Hyun-do returned to the original location.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Would you like a cup of coffee or something?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No, I&#x2019;m fine. First, I will briefly sum up the situation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wrote down the name Red Mafia on a piece of paper.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is the largest criminal organization in Russia. They have committed many crimes in this world.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. What are they...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;From now on, the secret I will tell you has been classified as a class 1 secret by the CIA.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Hup!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do&#x2019;s eyes widened and he closed his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s the Red Mafia that runs the Hermitage Museum.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;O-Oh my god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I think I know what their purpose is. Sooner or later, I think there will be a tremendous amount of imitation art in the world. In particular, there will be a lot of Rubens&#x2019; works. There will be no rumours about fakes circulating.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">What if Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s Mona Lisa was copied and released on the market?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was such a famous work that everyone would know it was a fake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But what about Rubens&#x2019; the Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus, or Massacre of the Innocents?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Few people knew who owned them.</span></p><p><span style="">In other words, there were two reasons why the Red Mafia targeted Rubens&#x2019; works for this crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was a painter of high value who left behind a lot of works.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then why was a forgery provided here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;To sell a fake, it needs to be made real. The painting would be worth billions of won. They don&#x2019;t want it compared to the real thing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;......!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Soon, there will be more people looking at the painting displayed here for a variety of reasons. They will be completely fooled by the Red Mafia. Director Kim Hyun-do as well. You were used by the Red Mafia without knowing it yourself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh god...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Hyun-do sat down on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="">He loved art.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Among them, Rubens&#x2019; paintings were exceptional.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had rejoiced at being able to display it...</span></p><p><span style="">But it was all to sell a fake.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Director won&#x2019;t be hurt if you pretend not to notice anything. I just feel a little bit of conscience. But will it be finished like this? The Rubens that they are trying to fake and sell is your favourite painting. Can you just watch knowing that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Then what can I do? I&#x2019;m just an old man who can&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I do have one suggestion.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Will it give me a shot at the Red Mafia that deceived me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They will be quite upset by the end of it. You will also get extra income from it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will do it. I can&#x2019;t forgive those bastards who defiled Rubens&#x2019; name.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and explained his plan to Kim Hyun-do, who felt faint as he heard the whispers of a devil.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
