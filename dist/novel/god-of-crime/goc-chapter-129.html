<p><span style="">Chapter 129 - Mister Park&#x2019;s Identity #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk looked at the person who magically appeared with a blank expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he shouted as he realized who they were.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-Y-Y-You...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The mask only covered the upper part of the face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, the scammers could see Phantom&#x2019;s expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked down at them with a smile.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In a dark room with no light, the white mask worn by Phantom gave off an eerie atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk gulped as cold sweat flowed down his chin.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Aren&#x2019;t you missing a person?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Kim Jin-woo screamed indignantly,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Song Chi-hyun was caught by the believers! W-Whose fault do you think it is?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is karma for deceiving all the believers over the years. You can&#x2019;t be like a politician and blame others.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This bastard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Jin-woo gazed at Phantom like he wanted to strike.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He touched the cutlery that was secretly hidden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person in front of them was a criminal that even the special forces couldn&#x2019;t catch.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, according to the Oyabun, Phantom was the one who handled the notorious Big Brother killer sent by the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They wouldn&#x2019;t be able to live if they attacked him.</span></p><p><span style="">Damn...&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he knew this then he would&#x2019;ve brought a gun.</span></p><p><span style="">While Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho were thinking about how to fight that monster...</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk quickly regained his cool and opened his mouth,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You aren&#x2019;t as big as the rumors. There would&#x2019;ve been tremendous benefits if you hadn&#x2019;t destroyed the cult. With those abilities, you could easily be the head of a religious cult. Being called a god by millions of people...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and interrupted Cho Min-hyuk,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t have a particular reason for shattering Sun. I&apos;m sorry but you just caught my eyes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You kicked the pumpkin for that reason?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Actually, what I care about are the pumpkin leaves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...What does that mean?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk beckoned them to come closer.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The cult leaders were overwhelmed by the atmosphere given off by Phantom and quietly gathered around.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I will summarize your situation in simple terms. The leader gathered a talented magician, a writer, and an engineer to create the pseudo-religion Sun. Your abilities showed a strange synergy and the group increased at a rapid pace.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cult leaders stared dumbly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s words were all true.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He really seemed to have a technique to read people&#x2019;s minds.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then someone passing by smashed the plate. Well, let&#x2019;s say that all the accumulated evil spirits exploded.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he saw Kim Jin-woo&#x2019;s face distorting.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Anyone who had their profit machine broken in front of them would react in a similar way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk stopped the agitated Kim Jin-woo from rushing towards Tae-hyuk and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You didn&#x2019;t come here just to tease us. It seems like you want something.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He realized that they weren&#x2019;t a match for Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk&#x2019;s tone towards Phantom had become quite cautious.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You noticed quickly. Is this how you were the leader for several years? Yes. What I want is a deal. Right now, the fanatics are aiming for you. They are searching and will discover you in a few minutes. What would happen then? Personally, I think the correct answer is either an Oriental Express style murder case or the French Revolution.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk started sweating at the conclusions.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;So let&apos;s skip the complicated story. I have a suggestion. I will help you guys escape from here. Instead, answer a question for me. Isn&#x2019;t it very simple?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...What will happen if I lie?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can say whatever your like, but there might be a punishment after you are free.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For reference, I want to know about the &#x2018;Yakuza&#x2019; who are behind you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk controlled his expression, but the other two turned white like ghosts.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;If that was a question then I would&#x2019;ve read the answer from your expressions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuhuk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk spread both hands out and declared,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Come, choose. The Yakuza in the distance, or Phantom in front of you. Your fates will be changed depending on your choice.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk was worried.</span></p><p><span style="">He had to accept Phantom&#x2019;s offer in order to survive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The issue was that Phantom wanted information on the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he made the wrong choice then he could meet a group of lions while trying to escape a tiger.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he couldn&#x2019;t reject.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Without Phantom&#x2019;s help, it would be difficult to get out of here alive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then what should he do?</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Cho Min-hyuk came to a conclusion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">First of all, he decided to see what Phantom could do for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It isn&#x2019;t enough to just escape from here. If the Yakuza finds out that I spoke to you about them then it will be hard for me to survive after leaving here. I&#x2019;d rather...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There will be an after-sales service. Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ve already thought about that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk smiled as he answer he wanted emerged from Phantom&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh, that means...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;ll send you to a place where the Yakuza absolutely can&#x2019;t touch you. Once there, you can do the same thing that you are doing now. Of course, it can be hard starting from the beginning, so I will go and help you a few times if you want. Is this enough?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The conditions weren&apos;t perfect, but Cho Min-hyuk decided to be satisfied with this much.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A lot of their earnings were siphoned off to the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If they took advantage of Phantom&#x2019;s power, then they could get a lot more revenue than they were right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk asked for confirmation.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Will we really be in a place where the Yakuza can&#x2019;t reach us?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. I promise for sure. Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What about the profits we earn? Do we have to give you a share?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Of course it is all yours.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Unlike the Yakuza, his services were free.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If that was the case, this might be a huge jackpot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yes, they were simply changing clients.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Didn&#x2019;t this sort of thing happen frequently?</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk slowly reached out his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand Phantom. I will accept the offer. I will be happy to tell you all I know. Then we are business partners.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Business partners. You can say that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled with satisfaction and shook Cho Min-hyuk&#x2019;s hand.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, the cult leaders made an alliance with the criminal called Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk told Tae-hyuk everything he knew about the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The contents that emerged from his mouth was half expected.</span></p><p><span style="">Japan was a country where numerous cults existed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, many of them were backed by the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk was a Korean but he had grown up in a Japanese cult since childhood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a Yakuza executive saw his talent and made a suggestion.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Create a cult in South Korea.&#xA0;</span><span style="">I will give you support for it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">The goal was to us the followers to do things behind the scenes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, Cho Min-hyuk decided to go to South Korea where he could be the leader of a cult.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And over time, Cho Min-hyuk became the leader of the Sun Cult.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like the Yakuza are planning something in South Korea.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t much different from the Triads.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Drug growing, organ trafficking, etc. </span><span style="">Those things couldn&#x2019;t be done in their country.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk extended his notebook. It was the drawing of the strangely familiar man wearing black sunglasses.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk might know who he was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, it is too small so I don&#x2019;t know if this is correct. That is Mister Park.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mister Park?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk narrowed his eyes and muttered the name.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was the same title that he found in the Blue Dragon Prison warden&#x2019;s notes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Was it simply a coincidence?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. An agent of the Oyabun. Most of the orders come through him. I also trade the necessary supplies through Mister Park.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see. Do you know anything else about him?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Only that he is Korean... Oh, I will notify you if he ever contacts me. But you won&#x2019;t be able to meet him unless I contact you personally.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In order words, Phantom wouldn&#x2019;t be able to meet Mister Park without his help.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t worry about that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-Heok!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk felt goose bumps at suddenly hearing his voice from the other person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once again, he realized how his opponent was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;For your mental health, I won&#x2019;t take off this mask.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk wasn&#x2019;t that familiar with the Yakuza.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most of his information was useless.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he was a person with contacts to Mister Park.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he used Cho min-hyuk&apos;s voice and face, it was possible to meet with him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It seems like we can&#x2019;t stay in here much longer. Shall we leave?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly led them out of the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The encirclement of the believers was imminent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a blueprint of the building. If you follow the escape route that I wrote down then you can escape from here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;W-We are surrounded by the believers...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I will attract the attention of the believers. If the believers follow me in the opposite direction, then the encirclement will be broken. You can escape through the crack.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, Phantom is alive, so how can you be three people... Ah, you will use your skills.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s correct.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom was capable of freely changing his face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would use it and head in the opposite direction of their escape route. In the meantime, the scammers would leave here.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk nodded with understanding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed to an area outside the building.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A man will be waiting here for you. If you follow him then the Yakuza absolutely won&#x2019;t be able to touch you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand. Thank you Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="">Cho Min-hyuk, Kim Jin-woo and Park Bum-ho followed the escape path on the map.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;We just need to follow this path.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The cult leaders started walking towards the destination without knowing what was waiting for them.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
