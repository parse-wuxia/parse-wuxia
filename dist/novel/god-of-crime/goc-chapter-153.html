<p><span style="">Chapter 153 - Time to Clean Up #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">T-That person...!</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin asked in a quivering voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Y-You...w-who are you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? You don&#x2019;t know? Really?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I-I-I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Oh, look at this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin&#x2019;s words seemed to be true.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the chairman of Taesung Chemicals.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He took the lives of Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s family and drove him to become the Bomber, yet he didn&#x2019;t even know Kim Tae-sung&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How funny. Really funny.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk brought his mouth to Song Won-jin&#x2019;s ear and whispered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I am called the Bomber.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Now Song Won-jin realized who was in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now do you understand why I came here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...T-This is ridiculous. You can&#x2019;t do anything but make bombs... H-How did you...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chairman Song Won-jin seemed terribly confused.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, he started looking at one corner of the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hrmm. There must be bodyguards in the next room. You are probably expecting them to come and save you when you give a signal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuock! ...You must have come here for a suicide bombing. You must have known that I was here. But this is the end. Surely you didn&#x2019;t think I would come here without any preparations!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin pressed the pager hidden in his pillow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then the connecting door opened and the security guards waiting in the next room rushed out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Originally, they would&#x2019;ve stayed in the same room as Song Won-jin to protect him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he sent them away for a while and this happened, and now the situation was reversed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if the Bomber had a bomb, it would be over if he was taken out before pressing the button.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;C-Chairman-nim! Are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin exclaimed,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kill this bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The elite bodyguards moved quickly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were holding something that looked like a briefcase.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In fact, the guards pressed the knob and pulled out a special gun.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Song Won-jin smiled with satisfaction as gunmen suddenly appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber would be riddled with holes due to the bodyguards...</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shrugged and used Bullet Time.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He aimed his pistol and killed four bodyguards in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;H-Heok! W-What is this?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t the situation flowing differently from what you thought?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For the first time, fear entered Song Won-jin&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now it seems like we are ready to talk seriously.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...What are you? The Bomber is clearly an ordinary human... Aaaaack! P-P-Phantom!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin realized who was in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He heard that Phantom had broken the Bomber out of prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, he strengthened his security by several times.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They always checked if there were bombs installed, everywhere he went.</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin thought that Phantom broke out the Bomber because he needed the bombs, yet Phantom had come barging in here.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That reminds me, didn&#x2019;t I get paid when the case involving Taesung was revealed? I was just trying to make money. Don&#x2019;t blame me too much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That is meaningless...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m a little busy. Let&apos;s get straight to the point. Ah, don&#x2019;t try to run away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk shot at Song Won-jin&#x2019;s foot as he tried to run away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kwaaaack!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You can keep trying to run away. But next time, I&#x2019;ll shoot something between your legs, so be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin nodded desperately with a white face.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then let&#x2019;s start the fun question time. First of all, who invented the bomb?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, that isn&#x2019;t very important.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;K-Kuhok, ugh... I-I understand! I-I will answer. I was the head of the research institute. I never gave the command...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t my question.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin gulped at the unexpected words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t you have a friendship with the Yakuza who came across the water?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin was shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">After seeing his expression, Tae-hyuk realized that this was the last piece of the puzzle.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But first, he needed to get a clear answer from Song Won-jin&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing with them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That...&quot;</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K-Kuaaack!&#x201D; Wahh...! Kuaaaaak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the blood splattering Song Won-jin&#x2019;s crotch.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I told you. If you don&#x2019;t answer properly, then I will shoot. There is only one chance. The next time...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...K-Kuock. Kk...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin looked at his groin bitterly.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had lost the most important part for a man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There is no more time to do that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pointed a gun at Song Won-jin&#x2019;s head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Song Won-jin couldn&#x2019;t endure it anymore and shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...R-Right! The Yakuza are behind the Taesung Group!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It would&#x2019;ve been good if you had said that sooner. What are you doing with the Yakuza?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That... I can never say it...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Perhaps this person threatened to kill you if you leaked such secrets?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took off the skull mask for a brief moment and Mister Park&#x2019;s face was revealed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;M-M-Mister Park!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Mister Park&#x2019;s name emerged from the mouth of the shocked Song Won-jin.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tsk. I would have told you to watch your mouth.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Phantom already knows everything.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Actually, it is only half-way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This, shit...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Song Won-jin was forced to tell everything that he knew.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He might die at the hands of the Yakuza, but he needed to escape from the threat in front of him first.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...Yes. We are doing research for the Yakuza.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What research?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The Yakuza call it Psychotropic Incense. It is a special fragrance with a brainwashing effect.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you know the raw material that it is made out of?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I know that it isn&#x2019;t a normal material.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t you know since you are doing research on it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin didn&apos;t say anything for a while.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He knew what the Taesung Group was doing to make money.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The moment he expressed this, his life would be like a fire in front of the wind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Even if he escaped from Phantom, he would die at the hands of the Yakuza.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what is the relationship between the Psychotropic Incense and the virus killing event?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin opened his mouth with a troubled expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He would&#x2019;ve never said this if a gun wasn&#x2019;t pointed at his head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is very hard to make the Psychotropic Incense. However, it is possible to increase the Psychotropic Incense if there is the T-1 virus, and it can even be spread through the air.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa. Wait a minute. Then you can enslave the whole country using the Psychotropic Incense?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;T-That&#x2019;s correct. Of course, it is still in the research stage, but once it is completed, we can sell Taesung Group products more efficiently than anyone else. When that happens, we will be the largest group in the country... No, the world&#x2019;s greatest...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">This was why they were studying something like the Psychotropic Incense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he didn&#x2019;t know how dangerous the Psychotropic Incense was.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;When I was in the Death Circus, it only clouded people&#x2019;s judgement. But it is evolving gradually through research.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Mister Park would borrow the name of his twin brother to enter the political world.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Something would go wrong and he would be killed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A young guard in his 20s got involved without knowing anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That young man would unfairly go to prison for 10 years, only to receive the death penalty.</span></p><p><span style="">The whole thing hadn&#x2019;t begun yet, but Tae-hyuk knew what would happen.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then who ordered that the Bomber&#x2019;s family be used as an experiment?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk wanted to know who had turned him into a scapegoat.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The person giving both orders was likely to be the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;That, I really don&#x2019;t know! The Yakuza are in charge of the research institute...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smirked.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yes, that was the case.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But weren&#x2019;t you the one who ordered it to be kept as secret as possible? Then aren&#x2019;t you responsible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, you answered my questions, so I&#x2019;ll finish it here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-This is the end? R-Really?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah. I have one last thing to ask. Where did the institute move to?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Song Won-jin eyes&#x2019;s shook but there was suddenly a gunshot from somewhere.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Tatang!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;K-Keok...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-How dare you betray Oyabun! Hooray Yamaguchi!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">One of the bodyguards was still alive.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His trembling hands held the briefcase as blood poured from his mouth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The deep smell of death filled the room.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk licked his lips.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Sheesh. I didn&#x2019;t get to hear the most important thing. Well, it doesn&#x2019;t really matter.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Without looking back, he shot the bodyguard with the pistol.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but I already know the location of the institute.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hawk Eyes allowed him to see the status window of the opponent, and briefly displayed the person&#x2019;s current psychological state.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As soon as Tae-hyuk mentioned the institute, Song Won-jin had recalled the location.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Naturally, the location of the research institute was marked on the Demon Revealing Mirror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ku, kukukuk... Goodbye Song Won-jin. Don&apos;t worry, your friends will follow you soon.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="">As he rose from his seat, he saw something in the mirror covering one entire wall of the hotel room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The place where the eyeballs were supposed to be was a hollow space.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The mouth was ripped from ear to ear and something red dripped whenever he laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">Something looked at Tae-hyuk and laughed,</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized who it was.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What, it is me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He shook his head a few times and the reflection in the mirror became Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s original image.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had to be tired.</span></p><p><span style="">Maybe he used the crime skills too much, but he couldn&#x2019;t rest just yet.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the research institute in front of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was considerably large since it was attached to a university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the street, researchers wearing white gloves were talking together happily.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;The atmosphere isn&#x2019;t bad. Now, this place...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">As Tae-hyuk got out of the taxi, somebody followed him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They took his hand and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Tae-hyuk, this is the Wolsang Institute. Starting from next year, Noona has decided to attend the university attached to it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, it isn&#x2019;t bad.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled at Ha-ran.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he suddenly lost his appetite.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Noona suddenly said that she wants to go to this university.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, he was planning to go to another research institute.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Suddenly, Ha-ran said that the director of the Wolsang Institute wanted to talk to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had planned to refuse and strike the Taesung Research Institute of Physics and Chemistry, but something strange lingered in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">It was like a premonition.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In order to find out what it was, he decided to meet the director of the Wolsang Institute.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Fortunately, I removed all witnesses, so the Taesung research institute won&#x2019;t be removed again any time soon.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran pulled Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s hand and cried out,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now, let&apos;s go!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Her footsteps were very light at the thought of this being her university life from next year. &#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk laughed as he touched something in his pocket.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had forgotten for a while, but that smile...</span></p><p><span style="">Eh? What was it?</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
