<p><span style="">Chapter 107: Pieces of the Puzzle #4</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">He had the things needed to control Yoo Cheol-ho, and now he could really start exploring the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After taking out the goods in his stomach, Tae-hyuk sat on the bed and rested for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">Even if the wound disappeared with &#x2018;Cancel&#x2019;, the damage to the body remained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;But even the blood is gone? Isn&#x2019;t this almost like turning back time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at the bed sheets that had been soaked in his blood.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was so dirty that it wouldn&#x2019;t have been cleaned even if he washed it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But now it was like being dried in the sunshine after being washed in a steam machine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then I need to hide these.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The silicon pack contained multiple medications and cards.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He took out everything from the pack, rolled it upside down, and took out a small waterproof sheet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he unfolded it, the same pattern as the wall of the cell was drawn.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The silicon pack was stretched as thinly as possible, pressed to the wall, and the waterproof sheet was stuck on top.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He used Forgery on the sides to make it naturally connect to the wall.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It couldn&#x2019;t be found unless the pattern of the wall was carefully touched.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is really perfect...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at his work with a satisfied expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since he became a Noble, the quality of Forgery has risen further.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What about the &#x2018;King&#x2019; status?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Just imagining it gave him goosebumps.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But what I have to do to become a King?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">He became a Noble by catching black list members and raising his stats.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he thought about it simply, couldn&#x2019;t he become a King the same way?&#xA0;</span><span style="">Since then, he had raised his stats a lot but there weren&#x2019;t any messages on the Demon Revealing Mirror.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe he couldn&#x2019;t get promoted in the same way.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Well, won&#x2019;t I know sooner or later? First, let&#x2019;s just do what I need to do for now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He checked Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s status and saw no signs of waking up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and put the spring back in the sketchpad.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I have paper and a pencil so I&#x2019;ll draw a blueprint of this place.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He never knew what would happen in prison, so he would just do what he could.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk sharpened the pencil, which had distorted into a weird shape, one more time so that he could draw something.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he did the same thing as he did in Atlantis.</span></p><p><span style="">Less than 10 minutes later, he had a blueprint of this place.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He put it in the place where he hid the medicine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong... I don&#x2019;t feel good. I keep sleeping all day long.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho, who was lying on the top bunk, woke up and stretched.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eh? Why does my head hurt?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He touched the back of his head as he felt a sharp pain.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk said with a smile,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A guard came. You were so deeply asleep that he hit you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn. When I get the chance, I&#x2019;ll pay that bastard back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho gritted his teeth as he thought about the guards.</span></p><p><span style="">Some time passed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hey Newbie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho laughed and looked down at Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be so hard. I growled like that last time because I didn&#x2019;t know who you were. Now I know you well so let&#x2019;s be friendly with each other.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was supposed to be sentenced for seven years due to special theft and assault.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho learned about this and treated Tae-hyuk as a subordinate.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll consider it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ohuhu... Newbie. Aren&#x2019;t there rumors that you have something good?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho made a smoking gesture.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Ah, he also smokes.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk didn&#x2019;t see it often because Yoo Cheol-ho didn&#x2019;t have money, but he remembered seeing several cigarettes.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Do you have a story to tell me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I don&#x2019;t. Instead, how about this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, Yoo Cheol-ho did have information that he could offer for the cigarettes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, it would be dangerous if the information entered the guards&#x2019; ears.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, Yoo Cheol-ho never dreamt that Tae-hyuk already knew about it.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Yoo Cheol-ho like he was interested.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Is there anyone you want to kill? Originally, I don&#x2019;t accept any contracts. I&#x2019;m only doing it this time because we are roommates. Ohuhu, if you tell me their name and where they live, then I will send them to the other world. How about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled without saying anything.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was someone who returned to jail after successfully escaping twice.</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho was in jail right now.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Telling someone that he would kill a person was like saying that he was thinking of escape.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, Yoo Cheol-ho wasn&#x2019;t a professional killer like the Chinese man Tae-hyuk recently met.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho just killed a few people weaker than him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but the conditions are the same for everyone. Bring information that will please m, then I&#x2019;ll give you cigarettes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk pulled out a pack and shook it in Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s face, as if it was a taunt.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho didn&#x2019;t know if it was planned but he saw it that way.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho reached out a trembling hand towards Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Then he coughed a few times before lying back down on the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Cough. That&apos;s okay. Be stingy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like it would be a few days before Yoo Cheol-ho gave in.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was nothing to do here except to eat and smoke.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, that temptation was intense.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk and extended a cup full of sticky coffee to Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll give it for free.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Wait a few days. I&#x2019;ll come with a great story.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Yoo Cheol-ho gulped down the coffee without knowing that there were strong sleeping pills inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After less than five minutes, he was in a deep sleep.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk decided to leave the cell tonight.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">He slapped Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s cheeks hard enough to make a sound.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there were no signs of him waking up.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like he was rewarded for the hard work of bringing the medicine in here.</span></p><p><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t hear anything moving except for a few guards patrolling.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, there was the sound of sleepless prisoners gossiping.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly left the cell using Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s tunnel.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was only one meter long.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, that was enough for Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk used Counterfeit to disguise his clothes as the guard uniform.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The navy uniform of the guards was born.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could walk through the front door of the prison and no one would notice.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could escape without the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, let&#x2019;s confirm where I can go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk walked casually down the hallway lined with cells.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could hear them talking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I have to kill him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was somebody burning another person&#x2019;s flesh.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Nowadays, the technology regarding gene collection has developed so much that your identity will be known if you leave a hair or skin cell behind.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then what can I do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, the best thing is to build a workshop with a tarp where you can handle the other person. Even if blood splashes, all the traces will disappear once the vinyl is peeled off. But if you can&#x2019;t do that, you need to do some DNA removal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was also someone giving away his secret know-how.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The prison was basically a correctional facility.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But in this manner, it became a crime school to transfer their skills to others.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk clicked his tongue and muttered,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How is that not one of these guys change?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was cute that they liked bragging about the crimes they committed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As Tae-hyuk was exploring, he heard something strange.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then did you trade with the newbie who entered last week?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What about it? I can smoke a cigarette after a long time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;No matter how I looked at it, something is strange. Maybe he is a spy planted by the cops.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He doesn&#x2019;t smell like a cop. Plus, have you seen his appearance? If he is a cop then I am the police commissioner.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuhaha. Anyways, it stinks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;But I was wondering about what he was hearing. Apparently it isn&#x2019;t crime related? He also didn&#x2019;t ask anything about other criminals.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong... Really? Then what the hell is his purpose?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shh! There is a guard.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk deliberately made his footsteps louder and confirmed who the prisoner was.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Hrmm, I was expecting some people to be suspicious. It is this guy.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He was someone who successfully broke out of Blue Dragon Prison with Yoo Cheol-ho.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Anyway, I need a good reason for gathering the information.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">This place was very narrow.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The doubts would soon spread like an epidemic.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Before that, he needed to take some measures.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk quietly left the area where the Korean inmates lived.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Once he moved to the area where the Chinese prisoners lived, he felt something strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the darkness, a few guards and Chinese inmates were leaving the cells and moving somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...It isn&#x2019;t an escape. What is it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Since he got the crime skills, Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s eyesight had sharpened.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could see the shapes of people from far away in the moonlight.</span></p><p><span style="">The suspicious group was going to an off limits area.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a place Tae-hyuk had never been, despite living here for nearly 10 years.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;They aren&#x2019;t sneaking in to secretly dig up the gold are they?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk followed behind the group.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They arrived near a place where someone was standing guard.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;What, there are no cells in there, so what is he guarding? Isn&#x2019;t this huge?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk recalled the face of one of the guards in charge of the Chinese.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, he knew someone.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Then Disguise!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk changed his face and casually approached the guard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, you went through a lot of trouble.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Uh, didn&#x2019;t you just pass by?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What nonsense are you saying? Did you fall asleep while working?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, no. Keep up the good work!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He easily passed by the guard.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Strange... I could&#x2019;ve sworn that he just went by.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk smiled and followed the people ahead of him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The place where the Chinese people ended up was a huge vegetable garden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Chinese prisoners and guards were harvesting something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hurry! This is the warden&#x2019;s command! The harvesting must be finished by tomorrow!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then Chinese curse words emerged.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk realized what the plant was.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;...Cannabis?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It was very difficult to grow cannabis since the awful smell made it difficult to grow it indoors.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Nurturing it like this...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;This is what the warden was hiding.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">He estimated that there was around 200~300 trees.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Can&#x2019;t 15g be extracted from a single tree?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">Let&#x2019;s say there are 300 trees.&#xA0;</span><span style="">An enormous amount of drugs, 4.5 kg at a time, was being grown in the prison.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was enough to make thousands of people addicts.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;It is around 50,000 won for 1g... So around 300 million won for one harvest?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like the Blue Dragon Prison wouldn&#x2019;t have just one farm.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After harvesting the cannabis, carrots and radishes could be planted to disguise it as an ordinary garden.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Drug growing was possible because outsiders only entered here a few times a year.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s mouth twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">He had no idea that he would find a drug field when he went looking for gold.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
