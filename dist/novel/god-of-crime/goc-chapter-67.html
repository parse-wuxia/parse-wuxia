<p>Chapter 67 - Bomber #5</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">The police SWAT team moved to arrest the Bomber, as they couldn&#x2019;t idly sit by as the culprit was knocked out by an unknown person.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The SWAT transport van arrived.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;The destination is Tapgol Park!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;There is a possibility that the culprit is armed, so be careful!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The SWAT team checked their equipment at their leader&#x2019;s command.</span></p><p><span style="">Safety goggles, kevlar vests and helmets, tactical vests, and operational clothing. &#xA0;They also held German made MP5 submachine guns and the P7 pistol, which would make it hard for ordinary people to run normally.</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, the crew&#x2019;s movements were quick.</span><span style="">They were the elite counter-terrorist unit under the Korean National Police Agency, the Special Weapons and Tactics Team, abbreviated as the KNP SWAT Team.&#xA0;</span><span style="">This group started moving to deal with the criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">The citizens took out their smartphones and took photos of the SWAT team.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Their atmosphere was different from when protests were taking place in Seoul.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that the special forces?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wah! They are on a completely different level.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did an act of terrorism happen?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As soon as the special troops arrived at the entrance to Tapgol Park, they secured the border and entered the area.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Fortunately, the citizens inside were all able to be evacuated safely.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The police had arrived in advance and were blocking people from entering.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they couldn&#x2019;t take away the smartphones.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, the fact that something was happening spread through the country thanks to SNS.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The media was controlled to prevent confusion, but individuals putting up shots couldn&#x2019;t be avoided.</span></p><p><span style="">The leader moved at a rapid pace with his team following behind him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A homemade bomb had enough power to blow up a building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a sense of tension in the movements of the troops.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, they had gone through high intensity training and were mentally prepared for moments like this.</span></p><p><span style="">There were no obstacles during their advance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They arrived at the place where the Bomber was in a flash.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah! A person!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The team leader looked at the Bomber from a distance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he muttered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crazy. He is all packed up and easy to take.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The leader&#x2019;s mouth twitched as he saw the bomb in the cart.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Thus, the Bomber ended up being arrested like this, but the storm after that was enormous.&#xA0;</span><span style="">What was the relationship between the explosion at Atlantis and the special troops?</span></p><p><span style="">A tremendous amount of opinions started to pour in from the netizens.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Most people saw it as a serial bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the voices demanding the truth from the government grew more and more.</span></p><p><span style="">The police commissioner felt like pulling his hair out.&#xA0;</span><span style="">As the commissioner of the NPA was getting a headache, he received a call from a subordinate.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They were asking what to do with the unidentified criminal who played a crucial role in resolving the Bomber case.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The commissioner of the NPA replied nervously,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This guy. Don&#x2019;t report everything. Just take care of it! You have done it once or twice already.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, the commissioner&#x2019;s concern was the Death Circus case, not the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tiwai International wasn&#x2019;t a problem.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The important thing was that too many VIPs watched the murder variety show that was created.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuoong. I need to at least save this friend, Chairman Song.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was nice to hear that the hospital incident was still settled, but things kept popping up.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Atlantis created by the Taesung Group was bombed... How did Chairman Song handle this?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If the connection between large corporations and high ranking police officers was revealed, his position would be in danger.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Maybe he should reveal a few showbiz scandals prepared in advance to divert the attention of the people.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The NPA commissioner issued emergency orders to gather the chiefs of each broadcasting station.</span></p><p><span style="">Just as he was organizing these incidents, someone called him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah, this person. Calling daily...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But this time, it was someone else.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">C-Commissioner...</span></i> <i><span style="">It is serious.</span></i> <i><span style="">The contents of the breaking news broadcasted by JC...</span></i></p><p><span style="">The commissioner heard his subordinate&#x2019;s words and rushed to his TV to confirm the breaking news.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a report about how the terrorist bombings occurred in order to retaliate against the Taesung Group.</span></p><p><span style="">Taesung Group had been secretly developing a virus for use as a biological weapon, but it was leaked and dozens were killed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">That incident was concealed and reported as a nitrogen gas leak.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At first, there were many people who boycotted the large company.&#xA0;</span><span style="">But within a few months, the sales had recovered as before.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a man who tried to tell the truth.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a researcher who felt remorse at seeing colleagues dying from his work.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, his declaration of conscience wasn&#x2019;t revealed at all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Taesung Group had ties to senior police officers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, one person could do nothing in front of the tremendous power of a large company.</span></p><p><span style="">Taesung Group infected his family with the virus to stop him from talking.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Whether it was a side effect or a variant, they died within a month of infection.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, the man disappeared and it had been a year since.</span></p><p><span style="">The police commissioner had cleared the incident from his mind.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He never thought he would look at it again.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His body started shaking.</span></p><p><span style="">The director of JC Broadcasting...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That bastard!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commissioner of the NPA called the director of JC.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then a frightened voice was heard, as if the director had been expecting him.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">C-Commissioner...</span></i> <i><span style="">No.</span></i> <i><span style="">We didn&#x2019;t do it.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">W-We were hacked.</span></i> <i><span style="">The broadcast right now is a pirate broadcast...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&quot;S-Stop the transmission right now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-T...That...</span></i> <i><span style="">If we stop the broadcast then they threatened to blow up the station like Atlantis...</span></i></p><p><span style="">The NPA commissioner watched the screen with a blank expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At that moment, the names of the people involved in this case appeared.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It included Song Won-jin, the chairman of Taesung Group as well as the police commissioner himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s over...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The purpose of the Bomber.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was to hide one target among nine.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">The undercover police officers didn&#x2019;t know anything about the storm that was blowing among the high-ranking police officers.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Aim for the moment when the God of Crime takes the money!</span></i></p><p><span style="">150 million won filled a bag.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The weight was heavy.</span></p><p><span style="">The God of Crime demanded cash that didn&#x2019;t have consecutive serial numbers.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The Bomber had been arrested, but the remaining four bombs couldn&#x2019;t be found.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then contact arrived from the God of Crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once he received the money safely, the remaining bombs would be handed over.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik&#x2019;s eyebrows twitched at the words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He truly is a criminal!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, after the Bomber was arrested, a plan was launched in order to capture the God of Crime.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was just before the money would be handed over.</span></p><p><span style="">The agent carrying the money asked,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Supervisor. Do I really just wait here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">For security reasons, they called their bosses &#x2018;supervisor&#x2019; or &#x2018;manager.&#x2019;&#xA0;</span><span style="">Right now, the agent was standing at Exit 1 of Gangnam Station.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a place where hundreds of people passed by in a single minute.</span></p><p><span style="">This place was the location of the trade.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The opponent was a fairly bold criminal.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes.</span></i> <i><span style="">There are officers and armed special forces nearby.</span></i> <i><span style="">You just need to wait.&#xA0;</span></i><i><span style="">An exact time wasn&#x2019;t specified so wait until the person contacts you.</span></i></p><p><span style="">The agent took off the sunglasses he was wearing.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He looked around and saw many men with sharp eyes.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Numerous people were staring at the bag he was holding.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the other person could take it then he really was a god.</span></p><p><i><span style="">Duk!</span></i></p><p><span style="">The position where the agent stood was just before the entrance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Therefore, the people passing by constantly bumped into him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">On the road, there were clothing stores and phone stores.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Without a doubt, it was the best place for an ambush.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Why did the opponent ask to meet in a place like this?&#xA0;</span><span style="">It seemed like he wanted to be caught.</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik contacted the agent.</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Officer Park.</span></i> <i><span style="">Can you check the inside of the bag?</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? The money is safe...&#x201D;</span></p><p><i><span style="">-Check it yourself!</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The agent pulled open the bag and briefly checked inside.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were many people nearby, excluding those who were undercover.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t show them a bunch of bills...</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ack...!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The agent couldn&#x2019;t help screaming.</span></p><p><span style="">The treasured bag he was hugging was empty.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was nothing left except for the transmitter hidden in a corner.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;H-He really is the God of Crime...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kim Do-shik said with a bemused expression.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Urgggh... Hungry...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk yawned as he sat on the couch and poured water into his cup noodles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had been running around all day so this was his first chance to eat properly.</span></p><p><span style="">Ha-ran, who always waited for Tae-hyuk to return home, had entered her dormitory at the private cram school last week, and would only return home on the weekends.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is really good but it is hard to wait for three minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk muttered as he broke apart the paired chopsticks.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right, shouldn&#x2019;t I cover the lid?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He looked around, but there was nothing to press on top of the lid.</span></p><p><span style="">There was a book he borrowed from An Eun-young, but she would be angry if there was any liquid on it.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk was her student for the next month.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t want to go against her because he needed her help.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well, it is a bit big but I&#x2019;ll use it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk took the liquid bomb on the table and placed it on the lid of the noodles.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a bit heavy but the noodles would turn out well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He laughed at that thought.</span></p><p><span style="">The police tried to catch him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he couldn&#x2019;t give this to them easily.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Uh... There are still two minutes left. Shall I watch TV? Then the remote...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The remote control was a master of stealth, it was hard to find once it ran away.&#xA0;</span><span style="">At the end of a search operation, he was able to arrest the culprit that was hiding between the seats of the couch.</span></p><p><span style="">The ramyun noodles smelled delicious.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk picked up his chopsticks and placed the noodles into his mouth, and then he took a sip of the broth.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Kuah! Kill!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help letting out a sound of admiration once it entered his cold and hungry body.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Breaking news was now being aired on TV.</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Today, the first trial against Chairman Song Won-jin of the Taesung Group is being held.</span></i> <i><span style="">The prosecutors have charged him with assault, killing a teacher and malpractice.</span></i> <i><span style="">The next breaking news.</span></i> <i><span style="">The National Police Agency...</span></i></p><p><span style="">The screen showed Chairman Song Won-jin handcuffed and with a bowed head.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Next to him was a face familiar to Tae-hyuk.</span></p><p><span style="">It had been a long time so it seemed like a reunion.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tae-hyuk slurped the delicious noodles with relish.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There were also leftovers in the fridge.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If he didn&#x2019;t eat it then it would go mouldy.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;By the way, I think I forgot something...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk scratched his head and laughed.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
