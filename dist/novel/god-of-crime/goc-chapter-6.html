Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While Kang-suk made a trouble expression, Tae-hyuk intervened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Director Cho Hun-il of the Personnel Administration Department... I mean, Team Leader Cho Hun-il. Maybe he will know. He is the person directly involved in the bounty.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Team Leader Cho Hun-il...? Ah, yes! I understand. I&#x2019;ll check it straight away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">As soon as the name of the person in charge was mentioned, the receptionist was surprised and hurriedly&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">made</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk&#x2019;s eyes widened as he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wah. How did you know that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you hear that I&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">deliver</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;for a Chinese restaurant?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I heard about it during a delivery.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;You deliver here as well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes.

He vowed that he would order from the restaurant to try it out one day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Sorry to have kept you waiting!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The receptionist&#x2019;s attitude&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">had flipped on its end</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. They bowed respectfully and guided the two people to a VIP room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Surprisingly, i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t wasn&#x2019;t Team Leader Cho Hun-il who was waiting there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">There was a&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">beautiful woman, so beautiful</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;that it wouldn&#x2019;t be strange to see her on TV, sitting&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">i</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">n a chair.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hello.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The woman in the chair bowed her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She had</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;neatly cropped, shoulder length hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;apologize for greeting</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;you while sitting down.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She pointed to the wheelchair next to the chair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Her legs are disabled.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was unable to walk</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, so&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">it was natural for her to greet them while sitting down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;I am Jung Yuri. I hear that the both of you have caught Yoo Cheol-ho.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk was so nervous in front of the pale beauty that he couldn&#x2019;t speak for a while.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk then pressed against his side and</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">exclaimed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah! This schoolboy... Seo Tae-hyuk made a crucial tip that led to his arrest. I am Cho Kang-suk of the Kang-dong police station&#x2019;s 2nd team.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk pulled out his business card from his wallet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The woman tilted her head&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">in</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;confusion. Even that&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">small movement&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">made her look beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I thought that detectives would be more&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">upright</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;than this.</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Haha! I am a bit unique.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;He completely fell for her. However, Hyung falling for her is a type of crime.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At the most, she looked like a university student. The age difference between&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">she and Kang-suk&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">was at least one zodiac cycle large.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;By the way, who is she?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was the VIP room of Sungjin Group, the largest corporation in South Korea. She defini</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">tely&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">wasn&#x2019;t any ordinary woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The president&#x2019;s secretary? ... I don&#x2019;t think so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She gave off a strange feeling of elegance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yuri bowed her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yoo Cheol-ho... Thank you for catching him. I want him to be judged by the law.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk made a pleas</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ant</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;smile when he heard her saying &#x2018;judged by the law.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">While she w</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">as still speaking calmly,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Y</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">uri had strange emotions showing in her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anger.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Hate.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He was confused over why she had such feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Although he was just sent here, Tae-hyuk had worked here as a security guard for two years.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">I</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">t was the first time seeing or hearing of someone&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">named</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;Jung Yuri, however.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She was either unrelated to the company, or a super VIP that Tae-hyuk&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">could never</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;approach.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk thought about the identity of the woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He might be able to find a connection.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;If a bounty was issued, then he must have leaked core secrets from the company.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Either that, or</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;he hurt a VIP. However, Yoo Cheol-ho&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">wa</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">sn&#x2019;t someone who would have a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ny&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">confidential&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">information</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;to leak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This meant that one of&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">his</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;victims was related to Sungjin Group.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Usually, the victim&#x2019;s identity wasn&#x2019;t exposed to the media</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, especially&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">if the person&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">wa</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">s a big business owner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">However, Tae-hyuk happened to be Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s neighbour.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Yes. He boasted about killing the daughter of a very important person. The name...&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">At that moment, the name popped into Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Currently, he was the president that oversaw one of Sungjin Group&#x2019;s divisions</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, and also one that</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;would climb up to be the vice-chairman of the company in the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Vice Chairman Jung Gwan-mok!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That reminded him, Jung Yuri had the same surname. Maybe...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Are you perhaps President Jung Kwan-mok&#x2019;s daughter?</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jung Yuri&#x2019;s eyes widened at Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;H-how did you know?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I work at a Chinese restaurant. Sometimes he comes in to eat jajangmyeon. He has been a regular for 20 years. I noticed that you resemble him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;My father and jajangmyeon... At any rate, I wasn&#x2019;t trying to hide it. I will greet you again</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;I am Jung Yuri, the director for the 2nd Public Relations Support Team.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The daughter of a president of a large company. Kang-suk&#x2019;s mouth&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">hung open</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;from where he watching</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, while&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk nodded&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">as if</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;he already&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">expected it</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Well, because she got to her position at such a young age,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">most</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;would think she was&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">gliding&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">off her father</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2019;s success</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">. That&#x2019;s why she hides it.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;If Noona is involved then you must be related to one of Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s victims...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jung Yuri laughed at being called &#x2018;noona.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then her expression became cold and hard when she heard Yoo Cheol-ho&#x2019;s name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...Yes. My unni. Please don&#x2019;t tell this to the press. Of course, I&#x2019;d obstruct you if you tr</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ied</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yuri&#x2019;s face looked like the manager of a big company.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk replied awkwardly like a broken robot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Yes. I will be careful.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Then sit down and relax. I&apos;ll get to the point.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk and Kang-suk sat down a</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">s</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a tea set came out. There were also sweets prepared in advance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Please eat.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk instantly put the sweets in his mouth and swallowed hard without chewing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The sweets are delicious.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ahaha. I made them myself. So please eat more.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah, yep!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;So, about the bounty. Seo Tae-hyuk, who played a crucial role in catching him, will receive 100 million won. Of course, you won&#x2019;t need to pay any taxes&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">since</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it is a reward.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">One hundred million!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">That&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">wa</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">s enough to get a decent home in the area.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk received the bounty, but Kang-suk was the one who made a fuss.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Wah Tae-hyuk! Amazing. 100 million won! Let&#x2019;s see, with that money... You can get a 3LDK house!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk bowed with gratitude and opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was lacking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Jung Yuri noona. I&#x2019;m talking to the director of the Public Relations Support Team, not a family member of a victim.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;H-huh?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The bounty money should be 200 million, not 100 million.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;No, it is clearly 100 million per person...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jung Yuri stuttered due to her confusion. She had thought of him as a cute younger brother</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, and</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;never imagined that he would insist on doubling the money like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;100 million per person is correct. But clearly, &#x2018;we&#x2019; are two people. Surely there aren&#x2019;t any restrictions on a detective receiving a reward? There clearly wasn&#x2019;t one stated.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;T-that is correct but...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Normally, detectives didn&#x2019;t receive rewards for catching criminals.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Of course, the criminal was able to be caught due to my tip. However, he probably wouldn&#x2019;t have been caught if it wasn&#x2019;t for Kang-suk hyung. He believed in the report of a high school student and went to investigate. Kang-suk hyung also threw his body to catch the criminal when he was running. So, did I catch him alone?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Certainly...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ah. I thought I was talking to a director of a big company. So let&apos;s look at it from the perspective of the Sungjin Group. Isn&#x2019;t the Sungjin Group launching a new crime prevention business?&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Its&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">concept is justice</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">which</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;is why you put up bounties to catch criminals.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;You actually know so much.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I accidentally heard the president talking.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Ah, Father.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;At any rate, I don&#x2019;t think it would&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">harm</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a company to support a detective who caught a criminal. Kang-suk hyung is even appearing on this evening&#x2019;s news as the detective who caught the criminal. If Kang-suk hyung receives the reward then it will be&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">quite the</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;picture. What do you think?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk stopped for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jung Yuri was watching Tae-hyuk with wide eyes. Kang-suk was already half collapsed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;The justice you have created. We will protect it with all our might.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The detective who caught the criminal had the whole country in an uproar.&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">This was including</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;the big company that was supporting him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was a chance to completely change any negative image about the Sungjin Group.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The money spent on corporate image making every year was in the tens of billions of won.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">When looking at that fact, 100 million wasn&#x2019;t a large sum of money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s words were strangely persuasive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Could you please wait&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">for</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;a moment</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">?</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;I will contact my father.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jung Yuri&apos;s hands were shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">She picked up the intercom on the table and called someone.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Ah, Father. This is Yuri. About the bounty for today? Because...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Yuri explained for almost 10 minutes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Yes, I understand. Of course, I will fill out a report. Yes. A high school student... that&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">After finishing the conversation, Jung Yuri slowly took a few deep breaths.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Then she smiled brightly and made the victory sign.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hooray!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk looked like he was going to cry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He had unexpectedly gained 100 million won.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk inwardly smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Anyways, he had obtained a bounty of 100 million. It would be good to make the most of that</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, now that&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk would completely become his protector.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He obtained a trustworthy person with someone else&#x2019;s money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;It is all thanks to Vice President-nim.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The words he said about Jung Kwan-mok were half true.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Of course, Tae-hyuk had seen him when working as a security guard here.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Furthermore, it wasn&#x2019;t now but 20 years ago that he went to eat jajangmyeon. The chef still boasted about serving the president of a large company.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The manner in which he managed to learn about the new business was a lie</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,&#xA0;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">because he actually had memories of the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Jung Yuri didn&#x2019;t seem to have the personality to talk about her father&#x2019;s mistakes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In the first place, her title was exaggerated.&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Her father had probably given it to her in order to protect her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">The evidence was that Tae-hyuk, who had been working here for two years, never saw her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt"><em>Warak!</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Tae-hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk hugged Tae-hyuk so tightly that it felt like his bones were going to break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;Hyung. I&#x2019;m choking...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;Brat. It is so touching. Really, thank you. 100 million, 100 million. I think I can get married if I have this much money!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He would have to find a person first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk glanced at Kang-suk but didn&#x2019;t say it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&apos;ll contact you directly through the Gang-dong police station. Ah. You might have to do some interviews or CF shoots for corporate promotion.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;I&#x2019;ll have to ask the chief first</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">,</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">but</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;it will probably be a positive answer.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;At any rate, congratulations Detective-nim. You have received 100 million won.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;This is all thanks to my younger brother. Haha. Tae-hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk hugged Tae-hyuk, this time pounding him on the back as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">[Robbery has been used.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">-You have succeeded in stealing the opponent&#x2019;s belongings!&#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&quot;N-no!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t resist crying out loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x201C;...D-d</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">o</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;you not like it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;That&apos;s not it! The crime skill was triggered!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Additionally</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">, this time it succeeded without any failures.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Tae-hyuk searched through his pockets.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He touched a somewhat damp piece of cloth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He took care not to be noticed by Kang-suk and Yuri wh</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">ile</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;checking it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">H</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">is expression instantly became rotten.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;Crazy. Panties!&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">He managed to steal a piece of clothing that someone was wearing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2018;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Robbery</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#x2019;</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&#xA0;was scary!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Kang-suk started dancing without being aware that his underwear was gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">It was the joy of winning a lottery.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">In fact, Tae-hyuk was the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">&apos;100 million won, a jackpot! Yes. I should obtain a house so I can surprise Noona.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt">Obviously, it would help Kang-suk as well.</span></p><hr><p></p></div><p></p>
