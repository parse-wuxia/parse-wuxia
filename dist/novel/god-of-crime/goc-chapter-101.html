<p><span style="">Chapter 101: Accomplice #2</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk reported his progress to the police chief.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, he would have to contact Kim Do-shik first, but the superintendent ordered that anything related to Phantom was to be reported directly to him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Could it be due to the unpleasant situation that happened to the former police commissioner due to Phantom and the Bomber?&#xA0;</span><span style="">The newly appointed police commissioner was desperate to catch Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was aware of this face and said as gently as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I would like to negotiate with him. He seems to know something about the Park Sung-yul case.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he heard an angry voice over the phone,</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Detective Cho.</span></i> <i><span style="">What does that mean?</span></i> <i><span style="">What?</span></i> <i><span style="">Since when did the police work with criminals?</span></i> <i><span style="">And the Park Sung-yul case?</span></i> <i><span style="">There was something like that?</span></i></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk was perplexed but he finished as calmly as possible.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;I uploaded the report a week ago. I also have new information that will be uploaded again today.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Hrmm.</span></i> <i><span style="">Really?</span></i> <i><span style="">Do you think I am a leisurely person that can worry about all those little things?</span></i> <i><span style="">Last weekend, I was running around with government officials and was tired.</span></i> <i><span style="">At any rate, there will be no negotiations.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will get as much support troops for you as I can.</span></i> <i><span style="">I will make sure that Detective Cho&#x2019;s commands are listened to.</span></i> <i><span style="">I&#x2019;ll also take you to the opera this year.</span></i> <i><span style="">If there is anything else, report it immediately.</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, I understand.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&apos;s expression darkened in an instant.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The superintendent wanted to give priority to catch Phantom rather than finding Park Sung-yul&#x2019;s victims.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It felt like his eyes would turn red from hunting Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, Kang-suk&#x2019;s forehead wrinkled as he frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho, who had been waiting for the conversation with the Gangdong police superintendent to end, said to Kang-suk,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;m guessing the negotiations didn&#x2019;t go so well?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Yes. In order to get some support troops, I have to catch Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whoa. Catch that monster? Now that he has the weapons...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho enlarged the excel table on his table screen, which summarized the current armed state of Phantom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He still had two bombs that could blow up buildings, and that wasn&#x2019;t all.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Didn&#x2019;t he obtain Cold War firearms from the Triads killer?</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;In addition, he has strange abilities that can&#x2019;t be identified. Even highly trained special forces wouldn&#x2019;t be able to catch him without any casualties.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It might be tough and it probably won&#x2019;t end simply. Do you remember how he took the money during the Bomber incident? It is like the police are playing on the palm of his hands.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He seems great because you say so.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;At any rate, what will you do?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What else? Follow the command from the upper ranks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&#x2019;t get too depressed. If Phantom is arrested then you can try and get what he knows about Park Sung-yul in the interrogation process.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who is depressed!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho laughed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It isn&#x2019;t easy to throw a ball into a bucket if you don&#x2019;t know where to throw it. First, let&#x2019;s focus on arresting Phantom.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;...That seems to be for the best.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A lot of preparations were needed for the troops to move and the opponent was armed with powerful firearms and bombs.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A lot of preparation was needed to deal with him.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then Kang-suk spoke like he just remembered,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But... Can we really catch the Phantom? I&#x2019;m not sure if that is possible.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Even the genius investigator couldn&#x2019;t come up with an answer.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom, the criminal that the police were looking for, was in a bit of a difficult situation right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Now. Try it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;......&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk looked at Eun-young, who was trying to feed him a sandwich, with an absurd expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had recovered enough to wrestle, but he had to keep that a secret from Eun-young.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;I might not be able to go to school for a while so I need to get help from Class President. Let&#x2019;s do what she wants.&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Um. Delicious. Is everything homemade?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young brightened as he ate her sandwich.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Y-Yes!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right, please pass this on to Teacher-nim. It is my diagnosis.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk reached in a drawer and pulled out the documents he prepared in advance.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Of course, it was an elaborate fake.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t that hard to create.&#xA0;</span><span style="">After copying the original, he just needed to adjust the ailment and treatment period at the bottom.&#xA0;</span><span style="">A technique that could forge a medical certificate or a painting...</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help sighing as he thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as she received the medical certificate and started to look it over carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Eight weeks?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Fortunately, it is spring break soon. I think I can get better before school starts again. Then I will be a third year...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, An Eun-young exploded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She grabbed Tae-hyuk&#x2019;s arm and pulled it towards her chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-Tae-hyuk!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh? Eh?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">The confused Tae-hyuk couldn&#x2019;t say anything for a moment.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The distance between the both of them was close enough for a hug.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He could feel An Eun-young&#x2019;s breath on him and he couldn&#x2019;t look straight ahead.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This room. It is a one person room. There won&#x2019;t be anyone who can interfere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I-Is that so?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I actually came here to do this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What do you mea...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;You will be in hospital for a while, so I have to do it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait a minute, let&#x2019;s just calm down. I think you are a little too excited right now.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, I&#x2019;ve been thinking about this for a long time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;What are you doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young came closer to Tae-hyuk before grabbing the bag that she had thrown on the bed and returning to her original position.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I came packed with everything necessary... Don&apos;t be too nervous, I have been preparing this every day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Ugh...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk groaned.</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young&#x2019;s condition was strange.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then he discovered something in her words.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Every day? D-Don&apos;t tell me...&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. You need to study.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young started pulling out books and printouts from her bag with an excited face.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Then she grinned as she placed them on the bed.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;How much are you going to fall behind in class? You have to really work hard to not fall behind so you can go to university. We have to work hard to get you into university.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk was at a loss for words.</span></p><p><span style="">He had promised to go to university together, but it seemed like she had misunderstood it as going to the same university.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, this wasn&#x2019;t a situation where he could correct it.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk swallowed his saliva.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;D-Don&apos;t tell me. Is this withdrawal symptoms?&#x2019;</span></p><p><span style="">An Eun-young was a model student with the studying skill.&#xA0;</span><span style="">She studied most of the day.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thanks to her skill, she was very good at teaching others how to study.&#xA0;</span><span style="">However, after getting accepted into university, she didn&#x2019;t need to do as much studying as before.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In addition, Tae-hyuk who she studied with every day was admitted to hospital.&#xA0;</span><span style="">For that reason, she didn&#x2019;t seem to spend as much time studying as she used to.</span></p><p><span style="">That rebound had come all at once.</span></p><p><span style="">Tae-hyuk gulped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He didn&#x2019;t know if the withdrawal symptoms were due to her skill, or simply because of her personality.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The only certainty was that he would have to study with her for all of today.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was literally &#x2018;only&#x2019; studying.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help screaming.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;S-Save me...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk finished his conversation with Phantom and made a determined expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Joo Hyun-ho, who came along with him as a partner, stood with a serious expression.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Usually, that seriousness would be gone already but this was an emergency situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Behind Joo Hyun-ho was the special unit waiting for the police superintendent.</span></p><p><span style="">Hyun-ho muttered in a low voice that could only be heard by Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He is an unbelievable great guy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk ignored the strange person in the trench coat and told the police superintendent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Superintendent-nim. 30 minutes. The meeting is at XX Building. It seems like he has accepted negotiations because there is something he wants from the police.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The police superintendent nodded with a satisfied expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well done. Will he be armed?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Probably. He is very careful and smart. He will run away if there is even the slightest sign of anything happening.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes. First of all, I want you to go in and talk to him as much as possible. Meanwhile, the special forces will enter to suppress the opponent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s expression clouded over. Even if he wore a bulletproof vest, the opponent was a terrorist armed with bombs and firearms.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was being used as bait to catch such a person.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk couldn&#x2019;t refuse the unreasonable command.</span></p><p><span style="">A police superintendent who was more interested in the achievement than catching criminals. The police commissioner was the same as well.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He felt nauseous but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He was the only one who could act as bait right now.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk closed his mouth and nodded.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He decided to come back alive no matter what.&#xA0;</span><span style="">And after this incident, Ha-ran...</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Then Detective Cho Kang-suk, please head to the scheduled place. The whole crew will be armed and waiting for the signal.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The superintendent was entrusted with full authority by the police commissioner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Thus, his neck was stiff.</span></p><p><span style="">The superintendent exclaimed in a voice that didn&#x2019;t seem dignified at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is time to strip off Phantom&#x2019;s mask!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">XX Building was approximately 20 minutes away by car.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk made his way to the destination in a military van.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The commandos chief in charge of the vehicle smiled and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Detective-nim, don&#x2019;t worry. Our members were trained to compete with the US counter-terrorism forces.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s mouth twitched.</span></p><p><span style="">He was going to confront Phantom, who was armed with bombs and guns, alone. If the opponent wanted, then he could put a bullet in Kang-suk&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk muttered sarcastically,</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;A well trained crew won&#x2019;t be able to stop a bomb from blowing up.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huh? What did you say just now?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Nothing. Oh, that seems to be the building.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">It was a three story building in the middle of the city.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was reported as a factory. The lights were on even at this late hour.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Did he take any hostages?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk wondered as he headed to XX Building.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The soldiers and police waited in the darkness so that Phantom wouldn&#x2019;t smell them.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the commandos leader sent a signal, they would pour into the building at lightning fast speed.</span></p><p><span style="">Once Kang-suk&#x2019;s shadow disappeared into the building, the leader gave an order on the radio.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Enter in five minutes. Prepare your power.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">-</span><i><span style="">Yes?</span></i> <i><span style="">Then Detective Cho Kang-suk...</span></i></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What did you say? I told you to be ready in five minutes.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader smirked.</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, catching Phantom was more important than the life of one detective.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He stared into the darkness with greedy eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">@</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk never dreamt that someone he had just been talking to would stab him in the back.</span></p><p><span style="">Once he arrived at the entrance of XX Building, a security guard stopped him.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;This is private property. You can&#x2019;t go in here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk quietly showed his police badge.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;It is an emergency situation. I received a report that a criminal is hiding here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The security stuttered with panick at Kang-suk&#x2019;s words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;T-That, to come in here, a warrant...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk pulled out the handgun that was hanging from his waist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I said it was an emergency.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A terrorist with bombs and firearms was hiding here.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was one of the few situations where a detective from South Korea could fire his gun.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;G-Gu...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The frightened guard stepped back.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk didn&#x2019;t hesitate to kick the iron door and break the lock before entering.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Phantom is underground.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He had to hurry as much as possible.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk ran like the wind towards his destination.&#xA0;</span><span style="">White-faced women screamed with confused faces, but they couldn&#x2019;t stop Kang-suk.&#xA0;</span><span style="">In the end, Kang-suk arrived at the door in the basement where Phantom was waiting.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;First of all, I should make the gun disappear.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He put the gun in his pocket and slowly opened the door.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He spoke in a quiet voice towards the waiting opponent.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom... As promised, I&#x2019;ve come.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The special troops would arrive here one minute later.&#xA0;</span><span style="">They would pour all their firepower towards Phantom without worrying about Kang-suk&#x2019;s death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Phantom...?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk realized that there was no one in the room.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was only a small table in the corner.&#xA0;</span><span style="">The phantom mask was placed on top of it.</span></p><p><span style="">As he looked around, tremendous shouting could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Power entry!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Dozens of people entered the room with their muzzles facing forward.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk&#x2019;s face distorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Weren&#x2019;t you supposed to come at the signal?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos chief became aware that Kang-suk was alone in the room.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where is Phantom?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk quietly pointed to the table.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He didn&#x2019;t come?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;&#x2026;Maybe he caught on to the operation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader threw his rifle and cursed,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Was it a trick to come here? Did we fall into a trap? Daaaaammmnnnn!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk spat out some dust.&#xA0;</span><span style="">If the Phantom was here then Kang-suk would&#x2019;ve been shot.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These bastards.</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader approached the table and slammed his fist against the phantom mask.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Kuak!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Then he screamed.&#xA0;</span><span style="">His fist smashed against something inside and blood sprayed everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;...Pff. It is a very slapstick comedy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk could only think that.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Kang-suk shook his head and approached the leader holding his fist.</span></p><p><span style="">He was still cursing Phantom.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Are you alright?&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do I look okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Maybe you should call an ambulance.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then you call!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The commandos leader yelled at Kang-suk.</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk cleared the scattered pieces of the opera mask.&#xA0;</span><span style="">There was a tablet with sharp edges.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a trap designed to hurt the hands if they tried to destroy the mask without checking the content underneath.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If that was a bomb then we would all be dead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Kang-suk clicked his tongue as he looked at the tablet.&#xA0;</span><span style="">Once the mask blocking the light disappeared, the pre-recorded video started playing.</span></p><p><span style="">Phantom&#x2019;s face flashed on the screen.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
