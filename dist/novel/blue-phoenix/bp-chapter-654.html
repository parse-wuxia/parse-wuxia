His eyes which had been clouded cleared up somewhat and it was obvious that all of his attention was on Yanluo.</p><p>&quot;It was around fifty-seven years ago that we realized you had died.&quot; Yanluo started, &quot;We don&apos;t even know how long it has been since you actually died, but at least fifty-seven years have passed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;At that time the Ten Courts of Hell were in chaos. We knew you had left because you were looking for an old friend, but you never returned Slowly, as time passed and we heard nothing from you, we feared the worst.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Having you go missing was a disaster. You were one of the strongest experts in the galaxy yet you still reached an untimely end. If it was possible for you to die, then who was to say that the other kings weren&apos;t in danger as well?&quot;</p><p>&quot;But more than anything, everyone was sad.&quot; Yanluo cleared his throat, and as he said this, his voice trembled slightly. It was clear to Hui Yue that he was remembering the emotions he had felt when he realized that one of his friends had died.</p><p>&quot;We all felt guilty for having let you travel on your own and not going with you. We thought that if we had been there, perhaps we could have saved you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, finally, as time passed we realized that we had to find another expert who could take your spot. We could not go without a Second Judge of Hell indefinitely, and thus, we announced that we would host a trial to find someone to take over your position as the second judge.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When the news was announced, all major sects and families within the galaxy were thrown into an uproar. But, fortunately, Diyu is unshakeable as the strongest faction, and no one moved against us. Everyone, however, wished to participate in the trial and the families and sects sent their most outstanding younger generation members to try and become the new King of Hell.&quot;</p><p>Yanluo went on and explained everything that had happened during the trials in detail, and he really spent a lot of time talking about Hui Yue&apos;s deeds. He painted a picture making it seem as if he had been the winner from the very beginning.</p><p>King Chujiang, who had been silent all this time looked at Hui Yue with a puzzled expression. It was rare for Yanluo to praise someone, yet now he was praising Hui Yue through the clouds, and it did not seem as if he had any intention of stopping.</p><p>At the same time, a sour feeling bobbled up in the heart of King Chujiang. He was not stupid, and he understood that from what Yanluo had already said, the new King Chujiang was not him, in fact, it was this youngster in front of them.</p><p>&quot;Pei Yue then asked us why we had not tried resurrecting you,&quot; Yanluo finally said, his voice shocking King Chujiang back to reality, and now he was even more puzzled than before. &quot;Resurrect me?&quot; he asked stunned. &quot;Clearly, it is not possible to resurrect someone who has died. When you die you go to the Yellow River where you will flow through the river until the day He Bo lets you reincarnate. You don&apos;t just ask for resurrection, nor does it happen to you just like that,&quot; he said confused, but Yanluo just smiled.</p><p>&quot;Since He Bo is in control of the Yellow River, and since he has so many souls, what does one soul less matter to him?&quot; The madame, who had been silent the whole time, suddenly said with a quiet voice. &quot;This was what Pei Yue said, and he was right. He urged me to go speak with He Bo.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He Bo is always stuck at the Yellow River unable to leave as he needs to protect it under the orders of our lord, but certainly he must miss certain things from when roamed the galaxy freely.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pei Yue suggested that we go trade with him. We would get him something he wanted, and in return, he would give your soul to us,&quot; the madame continued. The more she spoke, the stronger her voice grew.</p><p>King Chujiang&apos;s face was filled with disbelief as he listened to what was being said. &quot;But life and death are sacred!&quot; he almost cried out. &quot;We cannot just cheat death in such a manner! If others knew of this, they too would definitely go see He Bo time and time again, begging for their loved ones to be returned to them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, even if they did, maybe He Bo would release some of them,&quot; Yanluo sighed. &quot;Master already said that it is fine. If He Bo uses this as a way to get the things he wishes for, then no one can blame him. We all know that as long as your soul is not consumed by others, death is not the final destination but just a momentary rest before you are born anew with a new life.&quot;</p><p>King Chujiang was silent for a long time, trying to digest the words said by Yanluo before he finally nodded his head. &quot;It makes sense,&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;Master agreed, and thus we can only believe that what we did was not wrong.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But we have a problem now,&quot; he continued as he looked at Hui Yue, and this time there was no complicated emotions in his eyes, only gratitude. &quot;We cannot have two King Chujiangs,&quot; he continued and was about to resign when Hui Yue lifted his hand.</p><p>&quot;Your highness, I never wished to become a King of Hell,&quot; he declared. &quot;I only participated in the trial because King Yanluo promised me something should I succeed, and thus I gave it my all.&quot;</p><p>Listening to this young man, King Chujiang did not know what to say. It was clear that he really did not mind giving up his position as a King of Hell, something which stunned him completely.</p><p>Realizing that he could not understand the personality of this young man, he decided to change the subject and cleared his throat.</p><p>&quot;I know you obtained my soul this way, and I am very grateful to you, but when I died, my soul received a grievous wound. How come I sense nothing wrong with my soul, if anything it seems even stronger now than it was before?&quot; he asked puzzled.</p><p>This was something he had thought about for some time, and it truly puzzled him. He did not believe that the short time he spent within the Yellow River would be enough to heal his soul to such an extent, and He Bo did not have the ability to heal him.</p><p>Yanluo was strong, but he was no healer, and he knew that his madame was the same. So how come his soul was bursting with strength?</p><p>Yanluo grinned as he once more threw a glance at Hui Yue. Seeing that the young man had no intention of saying anything he decided to talk about it instead.</p><p>&quot;This young man has a part of the Nirvana Phoenix Flame within him,&quot; he started explaining, the words causing King Chujiang to raise an eyebrow in surprise.</p><p>King Chujiang was very knowledgeable. He knew that the Nirvana Phoenix Flame was incredibly rare, but even more so, he was aware that spending a wisp of the Nirvana Phoenix Flame meant that it was gone forever. Not many would be willing to use their hard earned treasure for a stranger.</p><p>His heart, which at first had viewed Hui Yue as an opponent, now trembled, and he felt sincere gratitude towards him. He had been willing to let go of a high profile position, he had used his Nirvana Phoenix Flame, and he had not asked for anything in return. He had even been the one who had suggested that they worked on resurrecting him in the first place!</p><p>&quot;I did what anyone would have done in my situation,&quot; Hui Yue said humbly while scratching the back of his head. He could not help but feel that Yanluo was praising him too much.</p><p>&quot;I highly doubt anyone would have done as much as you have for me,&quot; King Chujiang said honestly with gratitude in his voice. &quot;If I in any way can help you, please don&apos;t hesitate to ask.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Actually, there is one thing,&quot; Hui Yue said hesitantly, and his way of speaking caused King Chujiang&apos;s heart to leap. Had he misjudged this young man? Had he perhaps helped because he wanted something special in return?</p><p>&quot;You see, my friends and I are looking for the Alchemist God. Anything you know about him would be greatly appreciated,&quot; he asked somewhat embarrassed. Hui Yue had mainly helped King Chujiang to have Yanluo owe him a favor, but after hearing that King Chujiang was a good friend of the Alchemist God he could not help but ask.</p><p>&quot;Just this?&quot; the stunned King Chujiang asked in surprise, and Hui Yue, looking bewildered, nodded his head. &quot;It might not be a lot to you,&quot; he said seriously, &quot;but it matters a lot to me and my companions. To resurrect a friend I need to learn how to refine bodies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see,&quot; King Chujiang&apos;s heart beat rapidly as he remembered his friend the Alchemist God. He also used to have a refined body, and although Hui Yue had done so much for him already, he was almost about to ask if he too could get a refined body if he successfully found his long-lost friend, but decided against it. When Hui Yue opened his mouth, he said, &quot;I know I am asking a lot, and thus, if I succeed, then I will refine a body for you too. The materials though you will need to provide yourself,&quot; he said, and King Chujiang&apos;s heart started beating rapidly.</p><p>Forcing himself to calm down, King Chujiang nodded his head and cleared his throat.</p><p>&quot;When I died I was also looking for the Alchemist God,&quot; he announced, something that the others already knew, yet hearing it from him was reassuring. This meant that he likely had some leads that Hui Yue could use!</p><p>&quot;I had been searching all over the galaxy but no matter where I went, he was nowhere to be found. That was until I reached the Archaic World,&quot; he said mysteriously, and Hui Yue frowned.</p><p>&quot;What is this Archaic World?&quot; he asked confused. He had never heard about it before. Was it one of the oldest worlds in the galaxy? If not how had it gotten such an outstanding name?</p><p>&quot;The Archaic World is not a world as such,&quot; Yanluo said with a low voice. &quot;It is a danger zone where many worlds are gathered. It was the first place to be created in the galaxy, and it is a very unstable area of space. Worlds disappear there on a daily basis, and realms vanish even more often.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is dangerous, but it is also a treasure trove. It is filled with treasures, herbs, skill books, precious metals, and anything your heart could wish for.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is said that there is a medicinal garden that continues for thousands of miles with the most wondrous herbs,&quot; King Chujiang said. &quot;Next to this medicinal garden is the remnants of an Alchemist Guild with many formulas for concocting ancient pills.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Within this guild it is rumored there is a sentient medicinal pill. The one and only of its kind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that the Alchemist God always dreamed about seeing this medicinal garden and talking with the pill which had gained emotions and language. As such I am certain that he has gone to the Archaic World.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I went to the Archaic World, but it is truly much more dangerous than what even I imagined.&quot; King Chujiang sighed as he looked into the ceiling. &quot;I entered a world which collapsed the moment I set foot on it. When this happened, my body exploded into bits, and a part of my soul was ripped away in the collapse.&quot;</p><p>King Chujiang sighed. &quot;Although he should be in the Archaic World, there is a chance that he has died in there. He was no weaker than me, but when a world collapses, there is no way to escape. If luck is not on your side, then you will definitely die.&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
