He was determined to become a King ranked expert for many reasons. He wanted to become a King because of the power and fame such an expert commanded. Also, If he became a King ranked expert at his age, he would be viewed as an absolute genius!</p><p dir="ltr">Another reason was he did not wish to let his brother down. His older brother was a legendary figure, and he wished to prove that they were related. He wanted to prove that he too could become a legendary figure.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as the pill entered his mouth, it turned into waves of overwhelming energy which exploded forth. The overpowering energy made him both shocked and his entire body trembled as it rushed through his meridians. Gritting his teeth, he did not give up. Instead, he tried to take control of the energy only to feel that such a task was simply impossible.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The energy moved through his body on its own accord as it merged with the energies in his dantians and fused with his flesh and blood. As he merged with energy, he completely absorbed all the energy which entered it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Steam was starting to evaporate from his body as he was seated still, trying to figure out what to do with the uncontrollable current of energy exploding forth in his body.</p><p dir="ltr">The more of the pill which evaporated into thin streams of energy, the more painful it became for Hui Lei, and he soon gave up on trying to control it. Instead, he focused on withstanding the waves of pain which were constantly increasing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While he was trying to get through the pain of consuming Silvermoon&apos;s Pill, Hui Yue spent all his time by his side refining his friends and cultivating.</p><p dir="ltr">The original plan had been to leave the village, but after seeing that Hui Lei alone had not woken up after three days, their departure was delayed. Everyone understood how important this was to Hui Yue and during their wait they were all enjoying their time in the village.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gods felt at home. They were treated with incredible respect, and they learned so much about how the world had changed. Here they could live normal lives filled with the casual things such as eating, gossiping, and mingling with humans once more. Although they wished to at some point once more wander the many other worlds, right now, being in this village was a great way to relax after thousands of years of confinement.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was busy constantly using his energy to refine people and protecting his family while they underwent the remaking of their dantians by the Silvermoon&apos;s Pill.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It took Hui Lei a total of eight days to absorb all the energy of the medicinal pill, and as he did, he managed to reach the early King rank. As he opened his eyes, he felt the most astonishing energy filling his body, and he could not even begin to fathom how much he had grown in power.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My foundation was not very good previously.&quot; He muttered to himself. &quot;I rushed from the Disciple to the Grand Master rank and ended up not stabilizing my foundation. This caused it to become flawed. Had it not been for this wonderful pill then it would be very likely that I would not have ever been able to break into the upper dantian ranks!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Big brother truly dotes on us; he even produced such treasures for mother and father. I wonder how they are doing.&quot; He continued to mutter to himself. Looking around, he found that both Hui Yue, Hui Lifen, and Hui Guang were seated close to him in meditation. His mother and father&#x2019;s faces were very pale while Hui Yue&apos;s was filled with life.</p><p dir="ltr">Their parents were struggling with Silvermoon&apos;s Pill, but both of them remembered the words Hui Yue said and thus they could withstand it.</p><p dir="ltr">Nine days after Hui Lei had taken the pill, everyone had finished getting their bodies refined. Waking from his cultivation Hui Yue stood and stretched his body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had used quite a bit of his Nirvana Phoenix Flame, but upon looking at the flame, one could not see the difference in size with the naked eye.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh you&#x2019;re up.&quot; Hui Yue grinned as he looked at Hui Lei, and then he nodded his head in approval. &quot;You managed to become a King ranked expert, not bad, not bad.&quot; He said while laughing before he waved his hand and a few vials appeared.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;These contain pills. Some are pills that increase the Yin energy in your body. They are very important. Now that you&#x2019;ve unlocked your upper dantian, you need to balance both Yin and Yang until the moment you can become one with the world..&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I can help you become a God, but to do so, you need to rely on your own power to become a Saint. I can help you with certain pills, but pills will only do so much.&quot; Hui Yue continued, and his words made Hui Lei sober up. He nodded his head as he understood. It was true that his brother was a legendary figure, but no matter what in the end cultivation was something where one had to rely on themselves to achieve great heights.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thank you for your guidance!&quot; Hui Lei said with a deep bow before he ran out of the room, rushing to his room to focus on cultivating.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the eagerness of his younger brother Hui Yue chuckled and shook his head. He was reminded of his own attitude towards cultivating. Thinking of something, his smile vanished and was replaced with a frown.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Ever since he had become a God, he had felt that something was amiss. Although his attacks, relying on Ancestral Worldpower were outstanding, it was not enough for him to increase his strength. He felt that he had missed something important. There was something constantly bothering him in the corner of his mind, but no matter what he did, it was never apparent.</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing, Hui Yue decided to cultivate some more while waiting for his parents to awaken and surprisingly enough, both of them woke at the same time three days later. Considering their poor talent, their performance was not bad.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Congratulations on becoming Kings.&quot; Hui Yue said laughing and then raised his eyebrow in surprise. The aura on his mother was even stronger than the aura of his younger brother and father. Her talent was not better than the two of them, but it was clear that her determination and perseverance was at a much higher level. With enough determination one could produce miracles so seeing this, Hui Yue was excited.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;These pills will help you.&quot; Hui Yue said again as he handed each of his parents a bottle containing a great many pills. Every pill was equal to the ones he had give his younger brother earlier, only the Yin pills had been replaced with yang pills in the bottle for his mother.</p><p dir="ltr">Having given them the pills, he felt relieved. He had done what he had intended to do and now it was time for him to move on to the next part of his plans.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Mother, Father.&quot; He called out. &quot;My friends and I will be leaving soon. We will return home before leaving this area but I have something important I need to do within the Magical Forest.&quot; He smiled and his parents instantly nodded their heads. Hui Yue had already been home for quite some time. It was only understandable that he could not stay with them for too long. They knew he had so many things he needed to deal with.</p><p dir="ltr">Giving his parents a hug, Hui Yue smiled as he left the room. His heart was filled with a strange mixture of emotions. He was content now that he knew that his family was living well, but he was also excited about going out and experiencing the various worlds and realms that he knew existed in the vastness of space.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Gather up!&quot; Hui Yue called out with his voice filled with Ancestral Worldpower. A voice that reverberated throughout the entire village. Every God and friend heard the words and a smile appeared on their lips as they knew that now it was time for them to continue their journey. Everyone was excited.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting ready did not take long. They packed some food but knowing that they were going into the Magical Forest they also knew that food would be the least of their worries. Besides the fact that, all of them were now so strong that the essence of the heavens and the earth, alongside their Ancestral Worldpower, was enough to keep their bodies functioning. Food was not a necessity for them, just an indulgence.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the middle of the day when they finally set out from the village. Their steps were light and their mood great. Moving through the many fields outside the village they were greeted by the villagers who were working, and they waved back with friendliness. They were not in a rush while moving through the area, yet the moment they arrived at the forest their carefree expressions turned serious, while Sha Yun turned anxious. She had not seen her sisters in a very long time, and she feared how they were doing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue understood Sha Yun&apos;s feelings and held her hand. He gave it a gentle squeeze making her feel slightly better.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I know that there are quite a few beasts within this forest. Our goal is to find an Old Snake who is a Saint level beast. He knows where Sha Yun&apos;s sisters are and he also knows the Magical Forest the best. He can help us find the most desolate area where we can set the Formation of Life at and later merge with the world.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The others nodded their heads, and together they all took a deep breath and entered the forest.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although we are strong, everyone be alert. We don&apos;t know if there are other Saint ranked experts within this forest and even though killing Saints is as easy as killing chickens, they might be able to ambush some of our friends. I don&apos;t want to see them die because we were overconfident.&quot; Hui Yue said, and everyone agreed proceeding with care.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although they were careful, they all moved through the forest swiftly, and they managed to reach the deepest swamps where the Old Snake lived.</p><p dir="ltr">Within this swamp, many small islands could be seen above murky waters and on these islands many various magical beasts were living. They had built their own domains atop them. Some were like small caves while others were as tall buildings. It was also within this swamp that Sha Yun&apos;s sisters were now living.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of treading through the swamp, the group flew towards the middle of the swamp, towards the biggest of the islands where Old Snake lived. Although the surrounding area was grim, everyone was filled with excitement. No one was more excited than Sha Yun who was shaking and uncertain about how her sisters would take all the changes she had undergone.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Who dares trespass!&quot; A voice suddenly boomed and Hui Yue stopped in the air, gesturing for the others to do the same. &quot;Old Snake it&#x2019;s me, Hui Yue. I&#x2019;m bringing Sha Yun home to visit and see you.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s words were straightforward and honest. The moment the words escaped his lips a large man appeared out of nowhere. This was the snake beast who had taken his human form. His eyes were filled with both hope and sadness as he looked at Sha Yun while completely ignoring everyone else. &quot;Your sisters are not here right now. They went out adventuring about two years ago, and I haven&#x2019;t heard anything from them since. I think they missed you too much to just stay put.&quot; He apologized, and his words caused Sha Yun to feel depressed.</p><br></div><p></p>
