In total, there were eight new beasts that had arrived. Amongst these beasts Hui Yue instantly recognized two. Had Cai Jie been here, then he too would have noticed two of them.</p><p dir="ltr">The ones Hui Yue recognized was the snake-woman and the rhinoceros, the two experts he had fought before. Upon seeing them, he instantly noticed that they were not as weak as they had been when he was up against them. They were now many times more powerful, and their auras were so overwhelming that even Hui Yue, who had just become a God, could see that these experts were stronger than him.</p><p dir="ltr">The friends who were standing by Hui Yue&apos;s side were all shocked, but none of them were capable of feeling their overwhelming auras. It was like when Hui Yue had first seen the bull; they could simply feel nothing from them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These friends of Hui Yue were not slow, and upon seeing the hesitation within the white-haired young man&apos;s face, they all looked at the newcomers with hesitation as well.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The beasts that had just arrived were all surprised to see their alert faces, but they also smiled gently. They held no hostility as they all looked at Hui Yue with great interest.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I told you that I have a present for you.&quot; The bull started. &quot;And that is true. Within this broken realm, a group of us experts from the second generation have been living for a long time. A very long time.&quot; The bull sighed. &quot;We were all asked if we wanted to wait in here, and we agreed, but we never knew it would be so long. We were told that when the next Crowned Sovereign appeared, we were to follow him and support his decisions alongside protecting this realm our masters left behind.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Now you have appeared, we, the guardians of the formation, will follow you on your journey to make this Divine Beast World into a peerless heavenly world.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let us introduce ourselves.&quot; The many beasts said.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You already know me.&quot; The snake-woman said as she looked at Hui Yue with curiosity in her eyes. There was still something familiar about Hui Yue, something that she could not put her finger on, but it felt as though they had known each other for a very long time... But she was certain that the first time they had met was in the black stone tower chamber just recently.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You have met me as well.&quot; The rhinoceros said with a harrumph, and Hui Yue nodded to the tall beast in a greeting. These two he had indeed met before.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The third one to step forward was a large creature which reminded Hui Yue of Anubis, the Egyptian god from his previous life. This creature was a mixture between a black jackal and a human. Its eyes were one of the most beautiful golden colors Hui Yue had ever seen.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Shen Wei.&quot; The jackal said with a smile. &quot;I am one of the Nine Guardians of the Formation of Life. These are my brothers and sisters. All of us are from the second generation, and we have decided to follow the new Crowned Sovereign and assist him in his future adventures.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Tang Tian.&quot; A flood dragon introduced himself. &quot;I am Zhong Li.&quot; A qilin beast said, and only now did Hui Yue remember a conversation he had with Lan Feng. This was when he had seen a qilin for the first time that was tamed by the Rong family when he was a child. It was now obvious why those qilins had never surprised Lan Feng when he personally knew what their ancestor, Zhong Li, was like.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Lu Jing.&quot; A dog with three heads introduced himself, and after him came a massive sea snake. &quot;I am Jia Na.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The final beast that appeared in front of him was a turtle. This turtle was not black like the divine beast but deep blue like the ocean. &quot;I am Yan Lei.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">In front of them stood nine Gods, and these Gods were all filled with excitement and determination. All of them had bodies far bigger than Hui Yue and his friends, but upon seeing the somewhat uncomfortable expression on Hui Yue&apos;s face, all of them took on human form. Even the snake-woman whom Hui Yue had expected to stay as a half beast turned into a human with long legs. She was the only woman in the group, but no one looked at her with greed. If anything they were kind of apprehensive and fearful when they looked at her.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But there is one more thing I wish to gift you.&quot; The bull said excitedly. &quot;Everyone here you can trust completely, and thus I have to tell them that you are in possession of the Universe Box.&quot; These words caused all the eyes of the Gods to widen in surprise, and a few even opened their mouths in shock.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not very happy with the fact that these unknown cultivators had been told this secret of his, but he trusted the Vermilion Bird and the bull. If they had picked out these guardians, then they had to be reliable. Therefore, he did nothing to show his slight displeasure.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The reason I am telling these experts about this is because of the realm we are currently residing within.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is a broken world, and as it is now, no one is willing to create a formation that belongs to this realm exclusively. It has been able to survive by depending on the Formation of the Divine Beast World, but now that you have removed this formation it is just a matter of time before this world collapses. With the world like this no one is willing to become its sovereign, nor to spend the time needed to mend it. This realm is simply too weak and has nowhere near enough lifeforce to create a Crowned Sovereign, therefore, not many are willing to become the core, the foundation, and the owner.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;However, although this realm is weak and on the verge of breaking down, we have to remember that this realm was created by the divine master. It was something he left behind for the generations to come. We guardians have already lived here for eons, and we are emotionally connected to this red world. Although it is like a prison, it has also become our home.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Earlier, this friend of yours, Deng Wu, wanted to have a broken world as your personal refuge, why not accept this realm as your second world? Although you are not yet capable of mending it completely, you will be able to slowly mend and rebuild it. It will become stronger, and eventually, migrate some inhabitants from the Divine Beast World to this realm. One day it could become a real world and flourish once more.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that this was something that truly mattered to the bull, but not only him, everyone present had faces filled with expectations. Seeing these faces, how could Hui Yue possibly say no?</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Will it be a problem for me to become the sovereign of more than one world?&quot; Hui Yue asked. If there were any bad side effects, then he was not going to accept this task, but if it did not bring with it any downsides, then he would accept it. Just looking at Deng Wu&apos;s excited face, he could not help but smile at him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There are no downsides to having merged with more than one world.&quot; The bull assured Hui Yue. &quot;It is hard to create two worlds in a row because of the energy needed and the toll it takes on the body, but when the worlds have already been created it is different.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will guide you through how to merge with this realm first then when we leave it, I will let you merge with the Divine Beast World. While we are roaming the world, instead of having your realm left unguarded you can keep it with you in the Universe Box! When bringing it around with you it will be easier to heal the broken realm, and you can use it as a way of escaping dangerous situations. You can draw all your friends and yourself into the realm that is within your universe box, making you vanish from the outside world.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The Universe Box is an outstanding treasure in so many ways. It is not just a storage treasure but also a defensive and offensive treasure. However, for now, you can only use it as a storage item and to defend yourself by hiding within the realm you place within it.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head. He understood that the treasure he had obtained was truly marvelous, but for how special it was, he still did not fully understand.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Come here.&quot; The bull called out, and Hui Yue did as he was told. He moved towards the bull who lifted his hand. With Ancestral Worldpower erupting from his body, the mountain which had been split into parts when Hui Yue took away the Formation of Life, slowly started mending itself. It moved together as though the formation had never been there; the cracks healed slowly and soon the mountain looked as it had before. The only difference was now where the formation had previously been there was a crater in the ground.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sit down.&quot; The bull instructed, and Hui Yue did as he was told. &quot;Cut your wrist and allow for your blood to drip onto the ground. Then let your consciousness follow the blood into the soil and feel the world. Have an open mind, and the rest will happen automatically.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The bull said nothing more, and Hui Yue, although curious, asked no questions. Instead, he did exactly what he had been told and cut his wrist. He allowed for his blood to flow and enter the earth.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue made his consciousness follow this blood, leaving his body for Lan Feng to guard as he entered the ground.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment Hui Yue entered the ground, he felt as though he entered into a warm embrace. Everything around him was black, but the comfort and heat of the earth was simply comfortable and rejuvenating. Feeling this, Hui Yue suddenly felt homesick. He felt as though he had once more entered the warm embrace of his mother. While feeling this, he also felt some of his lifeforce flow from his body and enter the world around him. A full four thousand years of his life was used, but Hui Yue was a God. He was immortal and thus he had an unlimited lifespan.</p><p dir="ltr">That was to say, although his lifespan was unlimited he did not have unlimited lifeforce. Although it had increased tremendously from when he was a Saint, four thousand years leaving him was something he could definitely feel. Although this made him slightly feeble, he also felt as though the embrace around him increased its hold on him. It was now much more loving and tender.</p><p dir="ltr">It was not only Hui Yue who felt a change, but everyone on top of the mountain suddenly felt the entire world trembling. It was like the dry ground was suddenly given water.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue could feel how the warm embrace in which he was laying was thirsting for more, but it dared not draw out more energy of its own. The comfort changed from being that of a parent to becoming a child who was hungering for a parent&#x2019;s love. A small smile appeared on Hui Yue&apos;s mind as he allowed for his lifeforce to flow from his body and enter the thirsting world around him. The more he poured into the world, the stronger the connection between the two became.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The world did not have thoughts, it was not like Lan Feng who lived within him, but it had instincts and emotions which were conveyed to Hui Yue through the blood that had been dripped into the soil.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who at first just went along with the Gods and Deng Wu, finally started to feel something for this world, finally started to understand what the Vermilion Bird had said.</p><br></div><p></p>
