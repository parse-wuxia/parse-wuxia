They tried their best not to breathe as they were certain that if they drew attention to themselves, they would be slain on the spot.</p><p>&quot;Did you just say that my Little Xin has died?!&quot; the same voice boomed out again as saliva was flung everywhere. The poor messenger was already laying prostrate on the floor trying his best to be as small as possible, hoping the master would let him off.</p><p>Unfortunately, he knew that his fate was sealed the moment he had entered the hall. This Little Xin was master&apos;s most loved great-grandson. He was the most talented in the entire family, and now he had died!</p><p>To be the messenger who brought such news, it was simply normal that he would not live long.</p><p>&quot;Tell me exactly what happened,&quot; the master said. His face was dark with eyes full of hatred.</p><p>&quot;Reporting to master, the young master heard about a strange phenomenon that appeared in the western region. Some said that a specific area had become riddled with space fractures, and many assumed that a heavenly treasure had appeared.&quot;</p><p>The messenger swallowed hard as he pressed his forehead heavily against the floor, &quot;This lowly one heard that young master decided to investigate this phenomenon and headed out towards this area of space together with some of his sworn brothers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was one of these sworn brothers that returned to us with news of his death.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t mince your words! Tell me how he died! Was it a spatial fracture he entered? He would not be so blind that he cannot avoid a few tears in space!&quot;</p><p>The master spoke furiously, and the servant trembled. He was unable to contain the fear he felt ingrained deep in his bones. &quot;No Master,&quot; he said with a shaking voice.</p><p>&quot;As he arrived at the location he found that spatial fractures had formed a maze-like structure and that it was near impossible to enter into the inner regions to see where the phenomenon had originated.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He and his sworn brothers lingered at the edges of the maze, and suddenly, they discovered a young man coming out from within the deepest depths of the maze. He seemed as if he was capable of instantly recognizing where the fractures were located and how widespread their auras were. Hence he skipped around like a fish in water through the maze.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The young master was sure that this was due to a heavenly treasure that he had found. However, the young man who emerged from deep within this area of space claimed that it was a result of two supreme experts that had fought just recently.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No one believed him. Everyone started gathering to attack him together, only the young man had an intimidating air about him, and the closer he came, the more people got deterred from attacking him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This sworn brother of the young master was one such cultivator.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Young master was the one who convinced everyone to band together to attack this young expert, and so he could not back down no matter what.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This youngster who was exiting the maze lifted his hand, and something strange happened with the daos around him. He was so powerful that he easily killed all the experts that had banded together against him with but a thought, and sadly, their souls disintegrated right away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He what?!&quot; The master could no longer keep his cool, and his aura exploded forward. This master was unknown within the western region, and in fact, only a few within the entire galaxy knew of him.</p><p>He had faced the demon army before, and he was one of the experts that stood at the apex of the galaxy back when the demons last fought humanity.</p><p>Since then he had gone into seclusion. He had pursued the rank of Overlord time after time only to constantly fall short. However, it was not too exaggerated to say that he was half a step into the Overlord ranks. He had long since comprehended a heavenly dao.</p><p>To reach this rank, he was without a doubt prudent when it came to his own life. He knew that he needed to protect himself, and since he had no idea of the hidden strength of his great grandson&apos;s killer, he did not instantly fly out.</p><p>&quot;Describe the killer,&quot; the master said, his emotions once more under control, but a burning anger was smoldering in his eyes.</p><p>Everyone breathed lightly, and no one dared to speak. Even the messenger was frightened out of his wits, but his mouth spoke by reflex answering the questions right away.</p><p>&quot;The killer was a young man. He was wearing white robes with blue embroideries. He had white hair and blue eyes. He seemed like a celestial being that had transcended the limits of the galaxy according to young master&#x2019;s sworn brother.&quot;</p><p>&quot;White hair, celestial appearance. That should be easy to find,&quot; the master said with a nod of his head. It was clear to everyone that he had no intention of letting the killer go.</p><p>Rising from his chair, the master walked out of the hall with fast steps. No sound could be heard as he took a step, but everywhere he went an invisible pressure bore down on anyone close to him. As he walked by, they felt as if they were suffocating and beads of sweat rolled down their foreheads.</p><p>This was the most intimidating aura they had ever felt before, and when he finally left the hall, all of the servants and the messenger present heaved a heavy sigh of relief. They had survived!</p><p>While their master departed from his mansion deep within a secluded area in the western region, Hui Yue and his friends returned to the Gate of Retribution&#x2019;s world.</p><p>To Hui Yue, killing weak experts was no challenging task, and neither was it something he thought about after doing it; instead, his mind was focused on the Blood Demons.</p><p>How had they known that he had the Celestial Sword? The only ones who knew about this were his travel companions and the higher-ups from the Celestial Sword Sect. He just could not believe that either of them would betray him.</p><p>Had someone noticed him using the sword in the war earlier when he used it for a moment to assist Old Man Ling and then leaked the information to the demons?</p><p>This too seemed unlikely. If it had been leaked everyone would know about it, and he too would have heard the rumor. Not to mention all of the experts that would have come to try and steal the sword.</p><p>Sighing, Hui Yue was still at a loss for how they knew, but at the same time, he was now extra vigilant. He was not willing to become doubtful of his companions. He truly trusted them with his life, so his only choice was to look at his family.</p><p>Although he had only been part of the Celestial Sword Sect for a short time, he understood just how tightly knitted his sect was. Everyone was faithful to the sect, but he had a bad feeling about his uncle.</p><p>Not only had he agreed to lend the sword to Hui Yue, but he had also praised him to the clouds for something rather trivial.</p><p>He had seemed suspicious in every single way, and of all the people that knew of him, and the Celestial Sword, this uncle was the only one who gave him a bad impression.</p><p>Still, there was absolutely no proof, and Hui Yue was not going to prosecute him for something that stemmed from a mere feeling, an unfounded suspicion.</p><p>The important key was that it was the Blood Demons who were aware that this sword was in his hands and not the rest of the galaxy. Just this alone showed that whoever had betrayed him had gone solely to the Blood Demons directly betraying humanity.</p><p>This was something that Hui Yue in no way could accept. He hated the Blood Demons to the bone, and although he knew he would be in trouble if others knew about him having the Celestial Sword, he would rather have someone leaking it to the humans than the demons.</p><p>As soon as Hui Yue had flown away from the area of disturbed space, he released all his friends from the Universe Box. Together they traveled the final stretch back to the Gate of Retribution.</p><p>As they arrived, many cultivators came forward to greet them. They had been unknown by the time they had moved against the Sun and Hu families, but now everyone in the entire western region knew of them.</p><p>They were the liberators. They had traveled from world to world and freed people who had been oppressed and attacked by the Blood Demons, and at the same time, they also had fought against Blood Demon after Blood Demon. Their fame was equal to that of the Ling family.</p><p>The Ling family had spent tens of thousands of years building up their foundations. They were well respected within the entire western region even though they did not have a world to call their own.</p><p>Now, in just a year&#x2019;s time, Hui Yue and his friends had managed to create a name for themselves while fighting Blood Demons. This name mainly stemmed from them executing the Sun and Hu families alongside their valiant display during the war for the Gate of Retribution&#x2019;s main city and finally their gallant rush through the entire region where they swept away any Blood Demons in their wake.</p><p>Their display of overwhelming strength had stunned everyone, but it did not take long before the rumors of Hui Yue&apos;s heritage started to leak to the common people, and hearing this his prestige climbed even higher.</p><p>The number one genius of the younger generation! A third-generation descendant of the Great Roc, formation grandmaster, and the legacy apprentice of the Alchemist God.</p><p>No matter which title one used for him, it would be amazing, and to have all of them was simply like showering a rich man with more money.</p><p>Most of the mercenaries knew that the Gate of Retribution&#x2019;s city only stood now because of Hui Yue and his friends dealing with the supreme experts that had been sent to execute the humans and beasts during the war. Thus they had a very favorable impression towards Hui Yue and his friends.</p><p>Other than this, strength was respected. To be able to become the strongest of the younger generation of all the major sects and families was simply too outstanding.</p><p>Because of being greeted by a flood of people when they entered the city, it took Hui Yue quite a long time to get to the Ling family mansion.</p><p>As he reached the area, he finally heaved a sigh of relief. He needed to consolidate the insights he had gained from almost dying in the explosion of the World Ending Bead, but he dared not do so unguarded out in open space; instead, he had waited until he came back to the Ling family. When he returned, he instantly entered a secluded room and closed his eyes. He fell into a deep meditation and allowed for his consciousness to fully consolidate the growth in his soulforce that he had experienced from using it so much recently.</p><p>All of his friends settled down. Some of them cultivated while others relaxed. Laughter filled the entire Ling family and calmness once more fell over the group. They enjoyed the calm before they were to once more set out and hunt down Blood Demons.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the galaxy, an unknown man appeared as if teleporting in the void. He had a grim look on his face as he glanced at the fractured space in front of him.</p><p>&quot;There has never been a treasure here...&quot; he mumbled to himself as he started to move away. Every single step this expert took seemed like teleportation, taking him a few kilometers from his previous location.</p><p>Finally, he found a group of experts, and as he glanced at them he curtly asked, &quot;Have you seen a white-haired young man? His appearance should be like a celestial that has descended from the heavens above.&quot;</p><p>&quot;White hair? That sounds like the famous Pei Yue!&quot; one of the experts said with a smile on his face. &quot;Excuse me sir, but do you need this young hero for something? He is an important person in the war against the Blood Demons, everyone knows about him! I believe he resides with the Ling family in the Gate of Retribution, but he does not meet with just anyone.&quot;</p><p>The reason these people were speaking as much as they were was because they could feel that this man had an unfathomable cultivation base, one so deep that they could not even begin to guess how strong he was.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
