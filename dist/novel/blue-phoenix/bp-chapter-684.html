The energy was constantly trying to leave the shape that the Alchemist God had placed it in, and he needed to use his Ancestral Worldpower to constantly keep it in shape.</p><p>After an hour two legs had appeared out of the pillar of energy and beads of sweat had started to appear on the Alchemist God&#x2019;s head.</p><p>After three hours the torso and lower body had been molded and the Alchemist God was now in need of Little Green to wipe his face regularly, or he would be unable to see from the sweat that was falling from his forehead.</p><p>After five hours the head and arms had taken shape and within the golden flame was a rough shape of a human.</p><p>&apos;I am not going to enter that body if it is going to look like that,&apos; Lan Feng&apos;s voice suddenly sounded in Hui Yue&apos;s head full of dread.</p><p>Although the figure looked human, it was also rather unproportioned. The legs were not long enough, and the arms were rather long. Its fingers were small and fat, and the head was completely round.</p><p>Hui Yue instantly understood Lan Feng&apos;s worries, but he was unsure of what to say. The body was in no way perfect, but he could feel a strong energy coming from it. It was without a doubt a body filled with energy.</p><p>As if the Alchemist God could sense what Hui Yue was thinking, he slumped down and heaved a few heavy breaths before smiling at him. &quot;You don&apos;t need to make the body perfect,&quot; he explained. &quot;Bodies will change depending on which soul enters it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Each person has their own characteristics, and these will be displayed when the soul enters the body. The soul will mold the body one final time, as long as the soul enters the body right after the process of refining it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right now the body is still soft from my flame. Have the soul enter immediately, and you will see how much it will change.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, both Hui Yue and Lan Feng were enlightened, and also excited.</p><p>&apos;Go ahead, let Wang Ju Long enter the body,&apos; Lan Feng said, but Hui Yue shook his head and sat down with closed eyes.</p><p>&quot;Lan Feng is my brother. He has suffered for a long time. Let us give him his freedom first. Wang Ju Long, although I love her more than my own life, is not suffering right now. To wait a few days more will be something she will not even notice.&quot;</p><p>Saying this Hui Yue felt a burst of emotions come from Lan Feng&apos;s soul, and a smile appeared on his face. He searched in his core and slowly dragged out Lan Feng&apos;s soul.</p><p>The soul had been within him for a great many years already, and to see him leave, Hui Yue could not help but feel slightly empty.</p><p>Still, he did not hesitate, and neither did Lan Feng. It was impossible for Lan Feng to leave Hui Yue&apos;s body on his own, but as he was taken out, he was able to enter the other body on his own. As soon as his soul was outside, he flew straight for it.</p><p>Hui Yue and Lan Feng&apos;s souls had merged with one another, and although they were no longer in the same body, they could still sense each other, their emotions and feelings right now. Lan Feng was feeling excitement, fear, and anticipation.</p><p>He was excited because it was finally time to have a body of his own, and fearful because he wasn&apos;t sure of what exactly it meant to have such a body, nor what he could expect from it. He was full of anticipation because he had heard that a body created by the Alchemist God was the best body in the entire galaxy.</p><p>The moment his soul entered the body a spasm went through the body.</p><p>Just as the Alchemist God had said, as soon as the soul entered the body, it started changing its appearance.</p><p>The body went from having fairly short legs to having longer legs as they slowly grew in size. The arms that had been very long shortened and the round head turned well proportioned.</p><p>Nose, eyes, ears, and a mouth appeared on the face, and the body turned lean. When looking at it, Hui Yue could not help but compare it to a cloud leopard. Lean but with strong muscles moving underneath the skin.</p><p>Long blue hair grew on his head, with a few feathers mixed in. His skin turned white like the moon, and his closed eyes finally opened, revealing deep azure blue eyes, eyes the color of the cloudless sky.</p><p>As he opened his eyes, Lan Feng took his first step, followed by a second, and then a third. He stopped in his tracks and turned around to face Hui Yue.</p><p>Tears fell from his eyes as he suddenly ran towards Hui Yue and threw his arms around his shoulders. &quot;Brother you succeeded!&quot; he shouted out loud, and Hui Yue, who felt slightly embarrassed as he was being hugged by a naked man, could not help but smile.</p><p>Within Lan Feng&apos;s shout, one could clearly hear all the unjustified suffering he had gone through time and time again while being without a body.</p><p>&quot;Here, wear this,&quot; Hui Yue said while fetching a set of robes from his Universe Box, and Lan Feng, who finally seemed to realize the inappropriateness of his appearance just smiled as he dressed in front of everyone.</p><p>Thinking about this, Hui Yue decided that when Wang Ju Long was resurrected, only he would be present to see it.</p><p>After releasing Hui Yue and dressing himself, Lan Feng&apos;s eyes landed on everyone present. He smiled at them all and cupped his hands. &quot;Hello, I&apos;m Lan Feng. You all know me, but this is our first real meeting for some of us. It is a pleasure to meet you all.&quot;</p><p>The others quickly greeted him back, but before anyone had the time to ask any questions, Xiao She, who had appeared hesitant at first, ran to Lan Feng and threw herself into his arms.</p><p>Lan Feng was deeply shocked and was unaware of what he should do just stood there with his arms at his side. He stared dumbfounded at Xiao She who was sobbing on his chest.</p><p>This was something he had always dreamed about, but when it actually happened, he was unsure of what to do until Hui Yue smacked him at the back of his head, calling him back to reality.</p><p>An incomparably soft gleam appeared in Lan Feng&apos;s eyes as he lifted his arms and wrapped them around the sobbing woman. Looking at those two sweethearts, everyone felt warmth rise in their hearts.</p><p>The beast Gods present were all feeling reminiscent. Lan Feng was one of the descendants of the divine beasts, and he was someone they greatly respected.</p><p>The others were just happy to see him and Xiao She happy. Although Lan Feng had not been with them physically before, they had all thought of him as a comrade, and Xiao She was definitely one of their comrades, so seeing them so blissful was enough to make them all happy.</p><p>&quot;Phew, now I am free of the bloody snake baby talk,&quot; Hui Yue sighed to himself in relief. &quot;I mean if he talks about snake babies I&apos;ll just tell him I&apos;ll tell on him to Xiao She and I bet he&apos;ll shut up as fast as a clam.&quot;</p><p>No one heard what he said, but it was not meant for anyone to hear. Still, Lan Feng felt a chill the moment Hui Yue finished talking.</p><p>The Alchemist God was sighing deeply as he was trying to regain some of his Ancestral Worldpower. He had used quite a lot of energy to refine this body, and he had not refined or concocted anything for a long time. To suddenly refine a body was a tall order.</p><p>Hui Yue understood that his teacher had truly given it his all this time, and as a result, he would likely be unable to refine anything for a few days before he had restored his Ancestral Worldpower pool.</p><p>Although they were within the Archaic World, a place filled with Ancestral Worldpower, the Ancestral Worldpower pool of such an esteemed expert as the Alchemist God would still take a few days to fully restore.</p><p>Hui Yue also understood this principle, and he knew that the next couple of days he would have to practice creating a body on his own while having the Alchemist God by his side to give him pointers and small tips.</p><p>The good thing about these bodies was that either they were a success or a failure. There was no half refined bodies or bodies that would later crumble or have some unnoticeable defects.</p><p>&quot;Okay, Feng is finally with us! This calls for a celebration,&quot; Hui Yue finally spoke and smiled at everyone as he waved his hand. Food, delicacies, and drinks appeared on the tables nearby, and everyone was awed.</p><p>&quot;I have the Divine Beast World with me at all times,&quot; Hui Yue laughed. &quot;Although this is not immortal wine, it is still the best from our home world! This meat comes from our home world too, and when celebrating, although the taste might not be better than immortal food and wine, it is still nice to remember where our roots are.&quot;</p><p>They all nodded their heads, and only Wei, Pei Ziqi, Little Green, and the Alchemist God were from another world. Although Huli was from another world, she had spent thousands of years within the Divine Beast World.</p><p>&quot;Let us enjoy the delicacies from your world! Even if it is a mortal world, we too should enjoy the origin of our friends!&quot;</p><p>Wine was drunk in large quantities that night, and lots of meat was eaten together with fruits and other delicacies.</p><p>Even the exhausted Alchemist God was enjoying the time and relaxed while drinking. Xiao Hui, who had returned with Lei, Jo, and Lao drank for the first time in his life and found that wine was something he truly enjoyed.</p><p>The true hero at the party was Lan Feng. Everyone wished to speak with him, and he would circulate through the people who were present with Xiao She by his side.</p><p>He would laugh and joke with the others, talk about serious things or their past together. Everyone had something to talk with Lan Feng about and eventually the question that Hui Yue had worried about the most came.</p><p>&quot;That body... Will you be able to take on your real form?&quot; Xiao She finally asked in a low voice, and everyone turned silent as they looked at Lan Feng. Everyone except the Alchemist God who just sat down and sipped his cup of wine with his eyes closed.</p><p>A grin appeared on Lan Feng&apos;s face, and he nodded his head. &quot;This body is truly marvelous,&quot; he said with a serious voice. &quot;Although my daos are much weaker than Yue&apos;s, if I don&apos;t cheat and use his daos I am still equally strong as him because of this new, powerful body of mine. My Ancestral Worldpower pool has more than tripled!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And, since the body has merged with my soul, it is possible for me to take on my phoenix shape.&quot;</p><p>As he said this, his body turned blue and feathers sprouted from everywhere. His arms turned into massive wings, and his legs into birds legs with talons. Multiple tails unfolded themselves, and his hair turned into a sea of feathers.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the body which had been Lan Feng was now a massive blue phoenix that was hovering in the sky. The eyes which were like an endless abyss looked at everyone beneath him with a cocky expression. It was clear that Lan Feng was very proud of himself.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
