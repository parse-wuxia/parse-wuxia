It was clear that this man was the most dangerous person he had ever been up against.</p><p>Hui Yue was alert, and although Lan Feng was amused at seeing An He&apos;s flushed reaction, he too was vigilant.</p><p>None of them dared to underestimate An He. An He was not stupid, and he valued his life above everything else. Since he dared to face Lan Feng and Hui Yue, it was clear that he had faith in himself.</p><p>An He was busy guiding his generals as they headed further and further away from the human army, and Hui Yue and Lan Feng let him do what he pleased, but Wang Ju Long was not as forgiving and followed behind the four generals with the intent of killing them all.</p><p>At the same time, Hui Yue released his seals and started creating formations. Although he was strong, he was not able to use more than one grandmaster formation at a time, and the one he choose was the one he was most familiar with, the Ten Suns formation.</p><p>The Ten Suns formation was powerful against many enemies at once, but one should not underestimate the power it held against a single person.</p><p>The suns sprung to life one after another, and when Hui Yue infused it with the major dao of fire, they grew in size. When he reached out to his previous lives, it grew even further.</p><p>The star of Hui Yue&apos;s previous life was a star created by Pangu. It was one of the first stars in the entire galaxy, and it held some authority over the other suns and planets, by producing enough Ancestral Worldpower to support other suns and planets.</p><p>When the Ten Sun Formation sensed the energy of the star, they doubled in size and the heat that they radiated became scorchingly hot. The wind was billowing in the area around Hui Yue, and it became a blazing inferno.</p><p>These ten suns on their own would not have been enough to threaten An He, but with their current strength, they were not a formation to be looked down upon. Even Hui Yue had a hard time controlling them, and he could feel volatile energy hiding within them, waiting for the perfect time to explode outwards.</p><p>Hui Yue did not stop here. Right after the formation of the suns, he flicked his hand, and the Nine Peach Leaves appeared in front of him controlled by his soulforce.</p><p>Hui Yue was pushing his soulforce to its limits. He was not only controlling the boosted formation, but he was also controlling the Nine Peach Leaves, something that required him to have perfect control over his soulforce.</p><p>But this was not enough. The Celestial Sword in his hand was humming as he poured his heavenly dao of the heavens and heavenly dao of life into the sword.</p><p>He also activated all the major daos that he had comprehended, and he felt how he became one with them all.</p><p>At the same time, the sword in his hand was vibrating in resonance even more. The moment he became one with the wind, the sword almost sang in his hands as it was trembling.</p><p>Lan Feng had also prepared himself. He had taken on his phoenix form and merged with the same daos as Hui Yue.</p><p>Both human and beast felt how their bodies were swelling with power and the Ancestral Worldpower in the surrounding air was growing chaotic.</p><p>Wang Ju Long was chasing after the four generals of An He, so she had no time to deal with An He himself. She also knew that Hui Yue and Lan Feng had to finish this on their own. This was something they had needed to do for a very long time.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Blood Demons did not see this the same way, and while Hui Yue and Lan Feng were deep into their battle lines, they noticed two other demons making their way towards Hui Yue and Lan Feng.</p><p>Both of them were clearly heavenly dao cultivators, and their advance was menacing. Their faces showing hideous grins as if they expected that Hui Yue and Lan Feng had already died beneath their hands.</p><p>At the same time An He, who had looked perplexed before due to the suddenness of Wang Ju Long&apos;s attack was now once more filled with arrogance, and he even laughed out loud.</p><p>&quot;Need support?&quot; someone suddenly asked from behind Hui Yue, and everyone turned to see that the elder from the western region and the elder of the eastern region had just arrived behind them. Both were wielding their weapons and glaring at the two advancing demons.</p><p>&quot;This has to be a fair battle!&quot; the elder of the western region spoke casually as if it was the most natural thing in the world that they would enter this fight.</p><p>&quot;You are not ashamed to gang up on someone?&quot; the eastern region elder asked as he shook his head, but his words only caused An He to sneer.</p><p>&quot;This has nothing to do with you, why would you join our fight?&quot; An He asked aggressively, but the two elders just looked at one another and shrugged their shoulders.</p><p>&quot;This is war,&quot; the elder from the eastern region finally said, &quot;Do we really need a reason to try and face Blood Demons that are in front of us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not to mention we saw you and your buddies ganging up on one of our friends. Isn&#x2019;t it normal to help out?&quot; he continued, but then the western region elder laughed out loud, &quot;Old man, don&apos;t speak as if this demon has friends!&quot; he exclaimed.</p><p>&quot;It is clear that he does not have any friends, all he has are subjects he orders around. Even those demons who are coming now are only doing so because they want to curry favor with him, not because they consider him a friend.&quot;</p><p>An He&apos;s face twisted as he heard these two elders make fun of him, but he could say nothing in return as everything they had just said was completely correct. He had never considered anyone his friend and neither did he feel a need for friends. All he needed was people he could use.</p><p>Having arrived out of nowhere, these two elders headed straight for the two other Blood Demons and blocked their advance; their faces were filled with grins while the blood demons had unhappy expressions.</p><p>But no one had an uglier expression than An He. He was gnashing his teeth, and his hands were clenching and opening repeatedly.</p><p>Things had not gone according to his plans at any point. He had tried to kill Hui Yue and Lan Feng time and time again, but he had never succeeded.</p><p>He had tried to use his connections, but time and time again the Blood Demons he had sent had been wiped out. Even a whole army had been wiped out despite the leader of that army having a World Ending pill!</p><p>He had sent blood princes, but these princes had merely become a whetstone for Hui Yue to sharpen his skill with.</p><p>An He was not dumb. He knew about the phoenix sacrifice, and he knew that everything he had done to stop Hui Yue had ended up assisting Hui Yue and Lan Feng&#x2019;s cultivations.</p><p>He even knew that Hui Yue and Lan Feng were sharing a soul, and everything which helped Hui Yue assisted Lan Feng in also becoming stronger.</p><p>Seeing his enemies becoming stronger was something that An He could not accept.</p><p>Back when he had sent Lan Feng away in the hairpin, he had considered that a life of imprisonment in an item like that would be even worse than death but had he known that Lan Feng would come back with such force then he would have just killed him right then.</p><p>An He had wanted to return to execute Hui Yue and Lan Feng when he heard about them having been reborn in the Divine Beast world, however, when he heard about it, he had been busy with his demonification. It was impossible for him to give up the missions the Manor Lord had given him and he placed himself before anything else.</p><p>Unfortunately, these missions and tasks had taken him far away from the Divine Beast world, and by the time he had returned, it was already too late.</p><p>At the start, he had looked at Hui Yue and Lan Feng with amusement. They were just two struggling figures that would never match up to his grand schemes or strength; however, almost no time went by before they had become acquainted with both Diyu and the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p>No matter how strong An He was, he was not silly enough to go alone against these two sects, and instead, he waited for the opportune moment. Unfortunately, they had always resulted in Hui Yue and Lan Feng&apos;s improvement and his failure, and he was getting more and more agitated the more this happened.</p><p>&quot;Just because you have friends helping you, do you really think that you can easily dispose of me?&quot; An He sneered at Lan Feng and Hui Yue.</p><p>The moment he started speaking the daos in the surrounding air started to twist and churn, and it was clear that An He was starting to attack.</p><p>Lan Feng and Hui Yue&apos;s faces turned serious. Around An He three heavenly daos started to gather, the heavenly dao of heavens, the heavenly dao of death, and the heavenly dao of earth.</p><p>This was indeed the most frightening foe that had ever stood in front of them. Three heavenly daos, and five major daos. He had no soulforce, but he had Ancestral Worldpower in abundance.</p><p>Hui Yue took a step forward; the Nine Peach Leaves did not wait for the daos to fully manifest around him. Instead, they shot forward like brilliant rays of light.</p><p>Their speed was unmatched, the arc with which they flew was beautiful to behold, and they arrived in front of An He in less than a second.</p><p>Unfortunately, An He was no pushover, and he instantly reached out his hand to block.</p><p>His hand was protected by three heavenly daos that were superimposed on top of one another, and although the Nine Peach Leaves were as sharp as razors and filled with strength from his soulforce, they only managed to cut through the layers and leave a slight mark on An He&apos;s hand, no blood was drawn.</p><p>But even so, Hui Yue did not despair. This was a frontal attack, but the Nine Peach Leaves were best at sneak attacks while merged with the daos or hidden in an Ancestral Worldpower Attack.</p><p>The attack was to gauge how dangerous the three superimposed layers of heavenly daos were, and although he had managed to break through, it was with the entire strength of his soulforce assisting the Nine Peach Leaves.</p><p>&quot;We have a tough battle ahead of us,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself and Lan Feng as he controlled the Ten Suns formation and rushed headfirst at An He.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
