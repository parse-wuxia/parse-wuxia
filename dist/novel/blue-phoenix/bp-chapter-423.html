For them to perish caused the entire Shao family to lose strength. Although Patriarch Shao was one of the stronger Saints within Muchuan City, he knew that his personal strength could only bring his family so far. He needed strong allies and followers to keep their status as a strong family within Muchuan city.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking at Hui Yue, Patriarch Shao felt a shiver run through his body as he was reminded of the episode within the Grave of the Unknown. There had been a massive group of Saints, but suddenly a white snowstorm appeared and one Saint after another died unable to overcome their fate. Even to this day, Patriarch Shao felt great fear within his heart. Had he been unlucky, then he would have died as well back then. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Knowing that Hui Yue could kill so many experts as swiftly as he had, he was aware that Hui Yue could easily kill him right now. Although he was filled with anger and regret, he still acted humbly in front of &#xA0;Hui Yue. He acted so humbly, in fact, that even his son was forced to bow and apologize even though it was them who had lost many of their guards.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;To think that one from our younger generation dared to cause such trouble, I am deeply sorry and apologize.&quot; Hearing this, Hui Yue nodded his head. &quot;I accept the apology, now please excuse us. We were enjoying the night together,&quot; Hui Yue said. As soon as the words left his mouth, a common flying sword appeared in front of the patriarch, and moments after he and his son vanished through the open balcony. </span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as they left, waiters from everywhere in the restaurant came to clean up the dead bodies and wash the blood away, allowing for Hui Yue and his family to continue eating and enjoying their time.</span></p><br><p><span style="">....</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Father!&quot; The young master Shao said indignantly after they had flown away from the restaurant. &quot;That man was nothing more than an Emperor, how could you behave so respectfully towards him? He was worth nothing in your eyes!&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Shut up!&quot; His father called out, as he was angered beyond reason. &quot;Do you remember I told you about an expert who was as deadly as Yanluo? A man who killed Saint after Saint as easily as one picks flowers?&quot; His father asked, and the son nodded his head confused. He was unsure why they were talking about this.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The white-haired young man you saw was the expert I was talking about. And to think you had to go and insult him? We cannot even seek vengeance for the guards who were killed. All we can do is endure! Behind him is not only the Beast Army of Shenyuan but also a large group of Saints within the city!&quot; He could not help but think of the sudden rise in strength of those Saints Ye Ling, Zhu Jun, and Luo Qiang. It was clearly because of Hui Yue and his assistance to them.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Also did you not notice those two children? Although they looked to be ten years or less, they were capable of defeating King ranked experts. It is clear that he has many experts supporting him, and also many secrets which others can&apos;t even fathom. Don&apos;t insult him because we are not yet strong enough to deal with him.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking at his father the expression on the young master&apos;s face turned serious. &quot;You mean that some day we can get revenge?&quot; He asked excitedly, and the father nodded his head. &quot;Many nobles are unhappy with this young man&apos;s sudden rise to prominence within our city. He is a merely a mixed-blooded bastard. It is only natural that we get rid of him.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">....</span></p><br><p><span style="">The restaurant was incredibly efficient, and within moments the corpses had been disposed of. The blood had been cleaned, and new blankets, cushions, and curtains had been placed around the room. This ensured that there were absolutely no traces left of the fight. They even went as far as to give some complimentary dishes for their troubles. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The atmosphere at first was a little tense. Lao was a young boy, and although his determination was strong and he had killed many experts in one go, the sudden aftermath was making him feel somewhat sick to his stomach.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Seated by his side, Hui Yue patted his head gently. &quot;It is never easy, but you did the right thing. You might feel sick, but soon you will be okay. Think like this, by killing those who bully the weak; you will save many people instead. You saw how they were willing to kill us over something as little as a VIP room within a restaurant. Imagine how many have already died at their hands.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing what Hui Yue said, Lao felt better already. &quot;Father, that Saint who appeared, why did he treat you with such reverence? It looked as though there was enmity between the two of you, but even still he scolded his son in front of you. He even ignored the fact that we wantonly killed his elite guards?&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Lao had become much smarter since he reached the King rank and even small things were now noticed by this young man. Hui Yue understood that the question was serious and sent a wry smile towards Lao.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Do you remember I told you that a whole group of Saints was ready to attack us in the inner chamber of the Grave of the Unknown?&quot; Hui Yue asked. He had already narrated his entire experience in the grave and Lao nodded his head. He remembered everything his father told him. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;This Patriarch Shao was one of the people who blocked our road. He was slightly stronger than the weakest people within my Snowstorm Prison, and thus he survived, but like any expert caught within the Snowstorm Prison, he dreaded that he would die next. Even now I am sure that he feels some dread towards me because of this.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;But is it not bad to increase the enmity between our two families?&quot; Jo suddenly asked from the other side. &quot;What if he suddenly wants to take revenge on our family?&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing this question Hui Yue could not help but chuckle slightly. &quot;They will definitely want to get rid of me. Here within the capital of the Taiyang Kingdom, there are a whole lot of people who wish to get rid of me. The reasons they hate me are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Some do not want to acknowledge a person with mixed blood, and thus they want me to die. Some are afraid that I will lead the Shenyuan Beast Army here and destroy their kingdom.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Others are just unhappy that I have gained the strength that I have, while yet others are against me because they want my treasures and secrets.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;These many people who wish to get rid of me have gathered together, and it will not be long before they start moving against me.&quot; Hui Yue said with a shrug. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Lao asked curiously, &quot;has Uncle Gao warned you?&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Haha no, Uncle Gao is still investigating,&quot; Hui Yue said laughingly. &quot;It is just something I know will happen. These experts are human. No matter how much they want to hide their enmity, they are incapable of doing so. Because of the Red Wolf, my senses are much more heightened than one would expect. Seeing through fake smiles and expressions is as easy as scratching my head,&quot; Hui Yue boasted slightly, but his words caused Lao and Jo to nod their heads as they were filled with satisfaction.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue, deep inside was not as confident. &apos;We will be able to fight three or four Saints at once. If they come at me with more than that amount of people it will turn troublesome.&apos; Lan Feng said, and Hui Yue nodded seriously. Although he was incredibly strong, he was after all only an Emperor. Relying on Lan Feng&apos;s strength could allow for them to take on four Saints. If they used all their secrets, they should be able to take on even more experts, but this was something neither of them were willing to do unless they were close to dying.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&apos;Should we summon Wan Qiao?&apos; Hui Yue mused, but as always, the mention of Wan Qiao caused Lan Feng to shudder. &apos;We could summon her, but she is currently busy migrating more and more beasts from the forests of Shenyuan to their new territory in Siban. Interrupting her would not be helpful.&apos;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&apos;Our other option is to gather up all the experts that owe us a favor and have them ready to help at any given time.&apos; Lan Feng suggested, and Hui Yue nodded hesitatingly. &apos;Well for now, what we are going to do is to kill anyone who comes after me. I don&apos;t think they would dare make any large scale attacks as long as I support the royal family.&apos; Hui Yue decided, and his focus was once more on his family who were eating the many different delicious dishes.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Having finished eating, the group finally left the restaurant. Hui Yue paid the restaurant an extra spirit coin as he knew that killing the guards of the Shao family was something which had caused them extra trouble. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Let us make sure to come back here another time,&quot; Hui Yue said to everyone as they left the restaurant. Each of them summoned forth a sword; these swords were all identical, even Hui Yue&apos;s sword matched them, and they took to the sky headed back to the mansion. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Although Hui Yue wished for his sword to always be the fastest so that he could always escape, the same care went into the swords he made for his family. He gave them the best in case they had to escape from dangerous people. Even a Saint would be unable to attack them since their swords were at least three times as fast as the swords sold by the Black Market Auction House.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Entering their mansion once more, the entire family was in a very good mood. Today they all went to their own rooms and started cultivating. They each had their own things to think about. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Wang Ju Long was considering how comfortable it was to have a family. Her heart was warm as she remembered every single moment of the night. Even the fight had made her excited as she had seen her man and son fight side by side. Her heart was trembling as she wished to live a life like this every single day.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Jo was thinking about the heavenly food. She was reminded of the many times when she had been poor and forced to leave; the many times they had chased her away as she dreamt about entering and eating their delicious food. She felt gratitude towards Hui Yue and Wang Ju Long. The two had made her feel today that she was truly part of the family and happiness filled her. She knew that the reason she had not participated in the fight was because both Hui Yue and Lao wished for her not to kill anyone. And for this, she felt, even more gratitude. These three people had become increasingly important to Jo, and her eyes suddenly turned sharp. If she had to fight, then she would gladly fight to keep her family as it was now.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Lao was also deep in thought. His mind was still shaking from killing the men. Looking at his hands, he felt that blood was smeared all over them. He felt as though he was finally going insane, yet every time he thought about it, he remembered what Hui Yue had told him. That to kill bullies was really him saving others. Although it was troublesome, his heart finally started to calm down. Sighing deeply, he picked up the pills he had purchased that day and sat down in a lotus position. He placed one pill in his mouth starting to cultivate for the night. </span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
