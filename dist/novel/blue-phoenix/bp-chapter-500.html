He grew, and his muscles swelled as he took his red wolf form to increase his strength even further. Suddenly exerting some strength, he snapped Rong Liang&apos;s leg, causing the captured man to let out a shrill scream.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Rong Liang in pain, Hui Yue felt even more pain wash over him. This man had killed Wang Ju Long; he was going to suffer for a very long time before Hui Yue devoured his soul. He was not going to allow him to return to the circle of reincarnation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not willing to let him off so easily. With a single glance at the bottle containing Wang Ju Long&apos;s soul shadow, his heart shuddered once more in pain. He felt as if someone had stabbed his heart and was twisting the knife around. The pain was immense, and the only way he could manage was to keep telling himself that there might be a way for him to revive Wang Ju Long; that it might be possible for her to come back to him, and this hope was what kept Hui Yue sane. Still, he wished to inflict pain on Rong Liang in a way he had never before felt.</p><p dir="ltr">Rong Liang had been like a father to him, and even when he heard that he was a General for An He, he was only willing to give him a quick, simple death. He would allow him to enter the circle of reincarnation and hope that he had a better life next time, however, now that he had killed Wang Ju Long, Hui Yue no longer saw Rong Liang as anything other than his enemy. Someone who had to suffer and die a terrible death.</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear to everyone watching that the death of Wang Ju Long had changed something within Hui Yue. He now had the ruthless aura of an asura, not holding anything back at all as he broke bone after bone within Rong Liang&apos;s body.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t worry; you still have lots of bones!&quot; He sneered. &quot;I will break each and every one of them to let you experience the pain.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">There was a coldness in his voice as he broke one bone after another. At the start Rong Liang was filled with agony, he was screaming out in pain, but soon he could no longer scream, all he could do was whimper.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His Ancestral Worldpower was constantly being consumed as it kept healing his body. The more he was healed, the more pain he experienced, and he started cursing his enormous supply of Ancestral Worldpower. It was at this time that he suddenly heard a swishing sound as a person suddenly appeared in front of the broken Rong Liang.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yue, please! He is my father! Forgive him and let him go!&quot; Rong Ming called out as he stood in front of Rong Liang the same way Wang Ju Long had stood in front of Hui Yue previously. Seeing this, Hui Yue&apos;s eyes turned a little softer, but he shook his head. &quot;Ming... Tell me; he killed Wang Ju Long. He wants to kill me. How can I let him live? If I let him live, it is clear that he will just come after me later and that is something I cannot afford. What if he goes after our friends to get back at me? Do you want me to spare him so that he can kill us all later?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He has finally shown his true colors; he is the General of An He. I know he is your father and I know you are very filial, but I cannot live in the same world as him.&quot; Hui Yue said determinedly, and his words caused the hearts of everyone to shudder. He was not even going to give up seeing his good friend in front of him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will kill him quickly.&quot; Hui Yue finally sighed, and behind him red mist started flowing out like a tsunami, forming into a massive wolf head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this wolf head, Rong Ming paled. He understood that this meant that his father&apos;s soul would be devoured but he could do nothing about it.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thank you for buying me some time.&quot; A hoarse voice sounded from behind and suddenly a large arm wrapped around Rong Ming&apos;s body. In hand was another amulet, and this amulet was instantly crushed turning the outline of both Rong Ming and Rong Liang transparent.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;No!&quot; Hui Yue called out, but as soon as the wolf head descended, it went straight through the body of the two experts. His eyes were filled with rage as the two experts vanished into thin air, and soon only a single voice was left behind in the wind.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will meet again.&quot; Rong Liang&apos;s hate-filled voice sounded out and vanished into the air. His voice left behind only silence in the entire capital. Hui Yue kept hovering in the air, clearly deep in thought. No one closed in on him; no one spoke.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It only took a few moments before Hui Yue finally came back to his senses. He sighed deeply, and he was filled with worry. Now he was not only worried about Wang Ju Long, but he was also worried about Rong Ming, who had been grabbed by Rong Liang and forced to leave the world with him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue suddenly glanced around the entire city. The golden light surrounding him had long since vanished from his body, and he called out loudly. &quot;Every Saint gather up.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">No one dared to be slow, and all rushed towards him. They stood on either the rubble of a few houses or on flying swords looking respectfully at Hui Yue. They had all seen him explode forth with power, and they knew that they were nothing compared to him. Even their master, Rong Liang, was nothing in front of him, how could they possibly go against him?</p><p dir="ltr">These Saints were not fully aware of the strength of Rong Liang, nor were they aware of Hui Yue&apos;s level of strength, but the display of their fight from earlier had made their hearts tremble in fear. They, who had always thought themselves at the pinnacle of power, finally understood that there was more to cultivating than what they had assumed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I said it before, and I will say it again.&quot; Hui Yue said with a low and very dangerous voice. Anyone who was dared to go against him would be killed instantly; now there was no one who doubted this.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This world belongs to me.&quot; He said with a decisiveness that left no room for discussion. &quot;Anyone who wishes to leave is welcome to do so, but I will slay anyone who causes trouble.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue spoke, everyone bowed deeply to him displaying their attitude. Even those who had been against him before were now filled with reverence. Power truly was what determined the future accomplishments of an expert, and now Hui Yue had the power to back his words. No ordinary cultivator could go against him.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing that no one was willing to cause trouble, Hui Yue nodded his head and waved his hand dismissively after which everyone ran for their lives. They dared not tarry as they feared that Hui Yue in his rage of having lost both Wang Ju Long and Rong Ming and not killing Rong Liang would end up letting it loose on them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the Saints left, Hui Yue descended from the heavens and landed on the broken marketplace. Not a stone wasn&#x2019;t unbroken. Craters were visible everywhere on the pavement, and many buildings had been shattered. Fortunately, every mortal had been smart enough to escape earlier, so there were no casualties, but the destruction of the buildings showed just how severe the battle had been.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Landing on the ground, a thunderous and heart-shattering roar escaped Hui Yue&apos;s lips as he cried out his agony. Everyone within the city heard his cry, and everyone felt the grief and the hate hidden within. Many felt sorry towards the person who felt such grief while others felt the utmost fear.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing his roar and seeing Hui Yue fall to his knees, all his friends and family rushed to his side. Huli stood by his side and protected him while he cried. In her embrace was the bottle with Wang Ju Long&apos;s soul shadow. It was clear that to her, this was one of the most precious things in the entire world. Only Hui Yue could rank higher than this bottle.</p><p dir="ltr">The faces of all his friends and family were devoid of blood. Their eyes were wide open and full of shock. There was a tense atmosphere and even Jo and Lao who had felt motherly love for the first time were incapable of controlling their emotions as they allowed their tears to flow freely. After a second, Jo could not handle it any longer and threw herself into Hui Yue&apos;s arms, crying out loud.</p><p dir="ltr">Lao, who was as sad did not stop his sister. Instead, he just stood still like a stick and allowed for the tears to fall on his cheeks until Sha Yun forced him into her embrace where he too could no longer control himself, and he started sobbing uncontrollably.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will revive her.&quot; Huli said with certainty in her voice. &quot;We will go visit Yanluo and hear how we can revive her. We still have her soul shadow, I fail to believe that in this vast universe there is no way to restore the life of a soul shadow!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue wiped his eyes and held Jo close as he stroked her hair in a gentle way. &quot;Of course.&quot; He said with a determined voice. &quot;We will resurrect her!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The mood of everyone grew better as Hui Yue spoke and the others also wiped their eyes and decided they would revive her. Wang Ju Long was going to be resurrected and live by their side once more.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&#x2019;s return home for now.&quot; Hui Yue said as he carried Jo to their mansion. Hui Yue gestured for Ye Ling, Xiao Ning, Zhu Jun, and Luo Qiang to follow. His eyes also landed on Ma Kong, Gao Yan, and Rong Xing and gestured for them to follow too. Rong Xing was still unconscious, and Deng Wu was carrying her back like a princess.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Together this group traveled through the eerily silent city and entered the Hui Mansion. Here they all gathered in the main library. Although Hui Yue had been gone for long, his servants had kept the mansion in great shape. Even though many had been against Hui Yue, none dared to attack his mansion or move against anything he owned as Xiao Ning, and the three others, protected Hui Yue&apos;s friends and home. They had been incapable of protecting the princess, but they would not back down when it came to his personal things.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We returned successfully.&quot; Hui Yue said to his friends present. Although they had returned triumphant, no one felt like celebrating after their loss.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let us wait for Xing to wake up. She deserves to know what happened more than anyone else.&quot; Hui Yue sighed. Although Rong Liang had proven to be a General of An He&#x2019;s, Hui Yue was a hundred percent certain that his children knew nothing about their father, and instead, were just caught in the middle. Rong Ming had already been taken, and he needed to rescue his friend, but he would not allow Rong Xing to have the same fate. He would help Rong Xing become strong enough to get her brother back, or he would let her join her father and potentially her brother if she chose to support them instead. However, if she chose to support An He, he would kill her the next time he saw her. All his enemies were destined to die. Being merciful towards an enemy was the same as killing yourself.</p><br></div><p></p>
