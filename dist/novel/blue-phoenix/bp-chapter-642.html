He had indeed felt that they were Immortals of Creation from the auras they released, however, now he knew that since they had not comprehended a major dao their fighting strength was limited.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Lei, Jo, Lao, Huli, and Sha Yun introduced themselves next. Huli, being the only Immortal of Creation so far that had managed to comprehend a major dao had surprised the captain. It was clear that she was the strongest amongst Hui Yue&#x2019;s friends, yet she seemed so docile as she held their king&#x2019;s hand.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Cai Jie was next. &quot;I am an Immortal of Creation,&quot; he introduced himself. &quot;I have comprehended the major dao of light, and currently, I am trying to comprehend the major dao of wind.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Cai Jie said nothing except what was expected from him, and he kept quiet afterward. It made it hard for the captain to fully grasp just how strong Cai Jie was, but looking at everyone, it seemed that he was the second strongest expert in the group that Hui Yue had brought with him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Ye Ling,&quot; another expert spoke up. He was one of the experts that Hui Yue had met within the Grave of the Unknown. Although their relationship started out rocky, it was now much better, and Ye Ling had sworn to give his life to Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am a Primordial Immortal. I became a God not too long ago, and I have comprehended a little more than ten daos under the dao of darkness.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Zhu Jun; I am also a Primordial Immortal and have comprehended a little more than ten daos. I focus on the dao of light and am proficient in healing.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My name is Luo Qiang, a Primordial Immortal. I have comprehended around ten daos as well, and focus on the major dao of metal.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am last; I am Xiao Ning. I have comprehended a bit more than ten daos, and I am another Primordial Immortal.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">After this, everyone had introduced themselves. Hui Yue nodded his head approvingly. Everyone had done incredibly well in these fifty years that they had cultivated. It was impossible to comprehend so many daos in such a short amount of time, but everyone was able to eat Pills of Clarity like candy, and they had been able to use the many benefits one got from being part of a guardian sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The majority of the Pills of Clarity that they had consumed were not created by the Alchemist God but made by Hui Yue himself. Not only had he made special pills like the Pill of Clarity, but he had also made dao specific pills which he had given to everyone as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Dao specific pills were pills that boosted one&#x2019;s comprehension of a specific dao, and these were a lot cheaper to make than a Pill of Clarity. Their medicinal efficiency was also less than the Pill of Clarity, but unlike the pill of clarity, they did not lose their efficiency when one consumed many of them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, Hui Yue had created mountains of pills and gotten them delivered to his friends so they could comprehend daos as fast as possible, and he had not been disappointed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;All of us are Immortals of Creation,&quot; the captain introduced the group of followers that were part of Yanluo&apos;s guards. &quot;All of us have to have at least comprehended half a major dao to be considered for Yanluo Personal Guards. As such we are all fairly close to having comprehended a major dao. I am the only one in our group who has comprehended a major dao.&quot; The captain said talking about his men, and everyone nodded their heads.</p><p dir="ltr">The only ones who had not been introduced were Deng Wu and Wei, and neither of them were willing to say anything about themselves. The Yanluo Guard already knew about Wei as he too was part of the guard, but they only knew of his strength fifty years prior.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">To most experts, they would comprehend one or two daos in fifty years, not ten to thirty as these experts in front of them, but no one told the captain about the true circumstances.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not talk about his strength either, so everyone in the guard just assumed that he was a talented but normal Primordial Immortal. None of them would believe that Hui Yue had been capable of fighting and even defeating Immortals of Creation for more than fifty years already.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone knew that Hui Yue was a member of the younger generation, and although he was around hundred years old now, he was still quite a ways away from no longer being a member of the younger generation. This was because one would be considered a younger generation cultivator until they were two hundred and fifty years old.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A member of the younger generation would be capable of comprehending a few daos, but to comprehend as many as Hui Yue had was simply unheard of before. To have the strength Hui Yue had at his age was simply something that had never happened before.</p><p dir="ltr">But although it was like this, Hui Yue had no intention of drawing attention to himself. It was better if people underestimated him because it would be much easier for him to survive this way. He even kept his aura suppressed so when one looked at him it was as if they were looking at someone who had comprehended just a few daos at most.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well there is no point lingering here any longer,&quot; Hui Yue said with a final glance towards the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s Holy Mountains.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he was eager to start their trip, melancholy overcame him as he overlooked the place which had been his home for the past fifty years.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Fifty years had gone by in a flash, but when he thought about it, he realized that he had been in the Celestial Sword Sect for a very long time. He had managed to make good friends whom he would miss; he had even gained family members whom he valued dearly. Saying goodbye to those people was a depressing thought, but Hui Yue steeled his resolve.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will be back one day,&quot; he muttered decisively to calm his heart. &quot;Although I don&apos;t know how many years will pass before I return, this is somewhere I can call home so I will return here no matter what!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Clenching his fist, Hui Yue grit his teeth and turned around to face everyone. The melancholy he felt just seconds ago was now completely hidden within and replaced with excitement for what they were going to experience in their future travels.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A smile spread on his face, and his eyes shone as they landed on the captain. Nodding his head, they all started making their way through the broad city streets. Hui Yue and his friends followed and all of them were protectively surrounded by Yanluo&apos;s guards.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One was not allowed to fly within the City of Endless Clouds, so the group had no other option than to walk through the city.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everywhere they walked, the citizens would pause their daily chores and stand still, staring at the impressive entourage.</p><p dir="ltr">It was not unnatural for groups of experts to appear in the City of Endless Clouds, and sometimes delegations from other worlds came visiting to deal with business with the Celestial Sword Sect; however, it was incredibly rare for the groups to be as numerous as this one.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">What was even more shocking was the uniform that a hundred of these experts were wearing. It was a uniform that anyone throughout the immortal worlds of the galaxy knew. The uniform they had on was without a doubt the uniform of Yanluo&#x2019;s personal guards.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">To have a hundred of Yanluo&#x2019;s guards in front of them was like a dream. The Yanluo Guard was almost impossible to join, and the requirements were so outstanding that to join them one had to have overwhelming power, they had to be one of the few elite experts in the galaxy. Yet, here in front of them, a hundred had been gathered within the City of Endless Clouds.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone looked curiously trying to see why these experts were here. Was it because of the group of experts that were sheltered within?</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone had noticed Hui Yue and his friends. All of them were wearing their own clothes, but on Hui Yue&apos;s chest a small emblem was embroidered; an emblem which showed that he was a direct descendant of the Great Roc.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon closer inspection, everyone noticed that the others also had small emblems on their chests, showing which guardian sect they hailed from but knowing that they were apart of the Celestial Sword Sect didn&apos;t help them understand what was going on.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Perhaps they have committed some sort of crime, and the Yanluo Guards came to apprehend them. That would make sense. Look at how tightly guarded they are. It&#x2019;s as if they are afraid that they might leave at any moment,&quot; someone said with conviction in his voice, but others shook their heads.</p><p dir="ltr">No matter how they looked at it, it was clear that the ones in the middle were being protected, and were not regarded as criminals.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Perhaps it is that King of Hell,&quot; someone finally said, and his words made others widen their eyes and stare intently at the group that was being guarded.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It was a big deal fifty years ago,&quot; someone else mumbled. &quot;The fact that a direct descendant of the Celestial Sword Sect managed to become the King of Hell was celebrated time and time again, but no one has really heard anything about it since.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I wonder if he has just spent his time cultivating casually or if there is something we do not know about,&quot; another muttered, and suddenly everyone had accepted that this young man was indeed Chujiang, the Second King of Hell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When they reached this conclusion, everyone&apos;s eyes filled with reverence. Hui Yue, or Pei Yue as they all knew him as, was someone they all looked up to. He might just be a simple youngster, but he had managed to become a King of Hell!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The captain could not help but push out his chest in pride. Seeing all the respect and reverence his group was getting, he felt very proud. They were the Yanluo Guards, and it was clear that they deserved respect, but it was rare that anyone looked at them the way people were now, and every member enjoyed it.</p><p dir="ltr">Some even went as far as to wave their hands at the group, yet even though they were having a great time, enjoying being revered, none of them let their guard down. Everything was under observation. Every person who came close to them were assessed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The City of Endless Clouds was large. It was one of the largest cities within the entire galaxy, and although it was possible to travel through it fast, it was not something you could do when you had a full entourage of over a hundred people, and thus their advance was slow.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was not before they finally reached the gates that the captain and Hui Yue heaved a sigh of relief. Although they had enjoyed the attention, they could not help but feel that this was truly too much.</p><p dir="ltr">They were exhausted as more and more citizens started following behind them on their trip through the city streets. And finally, they saw the gate and all their energy returned to them. Soon they could fly away and would no longer have to deal with being stared at by thousands upon thousands of people.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Be careful though,&apos; Lan Feng&apos;s voice suddenly sounded in Hui Yue&apos;s head. &apos;Although you have managed to get out of the City of Endless Clouds safely, everyone knows about your departure, and they know about the group you have brought with you. They know that you have a hundred of Yanluo&#x2019;s guards with you and a few friends. If someone wishes to get rid of you, this might be the best time, so be careful. I would hate to lose our lives here.&apos;</p><br></div><p></p>
