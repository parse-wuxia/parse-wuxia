Hui Yue left the hall feeling a little uncertain, but at the same time happy.</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that the patriarch had seen through his intentions and given him permission to roam the galaxy as soon as he became an Immortal of Creation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue went towards the valley where his family was living to tell them the good news, the elders and the others within the hall did not move.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Please enlighten us as to why you allowed him to leave,&quot; the sect leader finally asked with a sigh. He understood that he could not question the authority behind the decision, but he still wished to understand it. Hearing the question, the patriarch just shrugged his shoulders.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is true that he is a peerless genius, but if we keep him within the boundaries of the Celestial Sword Sect, he will never grow stronger. He has already comprehended an outstanding amount of daos and is capable of fighting most Immortals of Creation on even footing and there should only be a few that are stronger than him.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If we keep him locked up within the sect, it is likely that it will be detrimental to his growth. He might become too conceited in his own power, and he will never face any real struggles. To become a true expert one needs to be tempered by life and death battles and it has been at least fifty years since he last had one of those.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The elders and the sect leader nodded their heads. What the patriarch said made perfect sense. They understood what he meant, yet they were still hesitant. They truly feared that Hui Yue would perish while out exploring the dangerous galaxy they lived in.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He should be fine,&quot; the patriarch tried to make them feel better. &quot;Not only does he have many friends traveling with him, one of them is miss Huli. She can be considered one of the strongest experts within the Celestial Sword Sect, currently. He also has Pei Ziqi by his side. You all know of her abilities. If those two can not manage to keep Pei Yue alive, then it is clear that fate wants him dead.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing him finish, they all just turned silent, and after a bit of time, they nodded their heads. It was truly out of their hands. If they wanted to protect him forever, then he was likely to become useless in real battles. Only those who had gone through a tempering process in the real world would prove useful, so ultimately if he died, then so be it. Geniuses were born all the time, and although it would be a great loss for the sect, it was clear that to allow him to grow risks needed to be taken.</p><p dir="ltr">While the elders, sect leader, patriarch, dao protectors, and ancestors were discussing these matters, Hui Yue had already left the premises and was heading for his home with the good news.</p><p dir="ltr">He had worked hard for fifty years. He had cultivated day in and day out and sensed dao after dao flow through his mind as he slowly adjusted to them, slowly merged with them, and then gained control over them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had spent time on formations, alchemy, and inscriptions as well. Slowly but surely he had become much more proficient at fighting, and his abilities were outstanding. But possibly because of all his recent training he longed to travel. Although he felt at home and welcome in the Celestial Sword Sect, he could not help but feel that something was missing.</p><p dir="ltr">This slow, routine everyday life without any dangers, without any risks, had dulled his senses, and now that he was going on a trip again, he could feel his old survival instincts starting to awaken.</p><p dir="ltr">Feeling that he was getting more and more enthusiastic, Hui Yue could not help but grin slightly. It was finally time for him to experience excitement once more!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Everyone come here!&quot; Hui Yue called out as he returned to the valley, and after a few minutes, everyone had gathered. They were all looking at Hui Yue with curiosity. It was rare for him to call for everyone like this, so it was likely that something big had happened.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">So far it had only happened when he had information about their friends and their breakthroughs, but looking at him he was far too excited to be sharing such information.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Have you broken through?&quot; Lao asked tentatively. He could not sense the strength of an Immortal of Creation from Hui Yue, but the only reason he could think of for him to be this happy was if he had made a breakthrough which would let them leave the sect and journey into the vast galaxy.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am still a little bit away from breaking through. However, we will be leaving the Celestial Sword Sect with everyone early,&quot; he said with a smile confusing the others.</p><p dir="ltr">Cai Jie and others had tried to convince him before to leave the sect early saying that he had plenty of protection now that all the beast Gods had become Immortals of Creation, but Hui Yue had been impossible to move. He refused to leave before he too was an Immortal of Creation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This sudden change of opinion caused Lao, Lei, and Jo to be shocked and confused. Even Huli and Sha Yun were surprised, but unlike the children, these two did not question anything Hui Yue said. If he wanted to go travel, they would just follow him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Diyu has sent a delegation here to get me,&quot; Hui Yue explained with a smile. &quot;I don&apos;t know what exactly they want from me, but this is a great opportunity to travel again. Being in Diyu will also help me increase my soulforce at an astonishing rate.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In Diyu it is likely that I will break through faster, and when I do, we will leave to go find the Alchemist God.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;For now we will head to Diyu with everyone. I already received permission from the patriarch so contact everyone and let them know,&quot; he said, and without waiting even a moment, he flipped his hand, and a communication orb appeared.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The five others followed him and retrieved communication orbs from their storage treasures, and after an hour everyone had been informed about their plans. It would take approximately five days for Cai Jie to arrive at the capital as he was the one furthest away. Therefore, Hui Yue needed to go to the City of Endless Clouds to speak with the delegation from Diyu and explain that they would depart in five days.</p><p dir="ltr">As he arrived in the City of Endless Clouds, he noticed that there was a strange oppressive aura in the air. It was as if everyone was extra careful with their behavior and the closer he came to the towering pagoda, the more obvious the aura became.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I guess it really is quite hard to deal with people from Diyu,&quot; Hui Yue mused with a small chuckle. Diyu was known for being hell. It was the place where sinners were tormented, and although no one enjoyed the torment, everyone knew that it was in Diyu they would end up.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">No matter what happened, and although they had infinite lifespans, it would eventually be their turn to die. They would die in battle, and when they did, they would end up in the Yellow River.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, everyone was careful around Diyu&apos;s experts. If they accidentally insulted them, who knew if their souls would end up flowing into the Yellow River forever, instead of being allowed to resurrect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue ignored this atmosphere and casually went towards the pagoda. As he entered the tower, he recognized the woman behind the counter and greeted her with a smile.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I need to speak with the delegation from Diyu,&quot; he said politely, and the woman nodded her head after which she led him towards the courtyards in the back.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The delegation was bigger than Hui Yue had expected. It counted two hundred of Yanluo&apos;s personal guards, all of which were specially selected for their strength, and only then did Hui Yue understand that it was a very important thing that he show up in Youdu.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My lords, I have brought Pei Yue to you, he requests an audience,&quot; the woman knocked on the biggest courtyard door, and it was clear that this was where the captain was.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;King Chujiang, please enter!&quot; the man inside said with a polite voice. It was clear that while the Celestial Sword Sect considered Hui Yue to be named Pei Yue, the men from Diyu all considered him King Chujiang.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Excuse my intrusion,&quot; Hui Yue said as he entered into the courtyard leaving the woman behind outside. She hesitated for a short moment before she left and returned to her position at the entrance of the pagoda.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;King Chujiang,&quot; the captain fell to a knee and bowed to Hui Yue with the utmost respect. &quot;We have been sent on behalf of King Yanluo to pick you up and bring you to Youdu unharmed. We have not been told why, but it is a rushed mission.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see,&quot; Hui Yue scratched his head. If they were in a hurry, it meant that it was an important matter, but he could not leave before Cai Jie arrived.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will leave with you. However we will need to wait five days,&quot; Hui Yue said decisively. He wished for his martial brother to be with him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had still not unlocked any memories about whether or not he was truly the martial brother of Cai Jie&apos;s past, but he still made great progress when it came to the open caves in his core.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In the time that had gone by, Hui Yue had gained a familiarity with the three open caves in his core. The figure that controlled the dao of space had not acted up for a long time, and he could feel that he was closer and closer to merging with it. This was the same case for the red gem which controlled the dao of gravity.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The one he had the least affinity with so far was the star. The star had proven to be the dao of time, but because Hui Yue had not been in any real fights, it was impossible to fully understand the limits of this dao.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The captain looked at Hui Yue and considered if he could convince him to leave earlier than this, but seeing the stern expression on Hui Yue&apos;s face, he just nodded his head. &quot;I understand,&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;We will depart in five days; tell me when you have gathered your friends.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">With that, Hui Yue returned to the Celestial Sword Sect where he started packing all his things. He went to speak with his father and say goodbye.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Go out there and become so brilliant that you blind this old man with your fame!&quot; he said laughing, &quot;Become a shining star and have your name resound through the entire galaxy. Make them know your name. Let them know that Pei Yue is not someone to be trifled with!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing his father&apos;s words, Hui Yue nodded his head. He would make him proud! That was something he had sworn to do when he merged with his old memories, and even now this was something that mattered to him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will be gone for a long time,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile. &quot;I have to find an old acquaintance when I am finished with my tasks in Diyu so that your last daughter in law can join us.&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
