Many shop owners came outside to look at the entourage and mercenaries, and others gathered to the side of the streets, ensuring that they did not get in the way.</p><p>Rumors started to spread through the entire city, and soon everyone knew that the Ling family had gathered their supreme experts and set out in two groups with them apparently heading in opposite directions.</p><p>These two groups were led by famous members of the Ling family, but mixed in with these members were also unknown cultivators, and they all seemed to be treated with respect from what people could see. These unknown cultivators were situated at the very front of the troops, and their eyes seemed to be filled with an abnormal coldness, and they had a murderous air around them.</p><p>It was clear that the Ling family had headed out to set a grievance straight, however, as for who their anger was directed at no one knew. The same with the motive behind their sudden actions, no one was clear on anything, and as a result, many of the stronger experts in town decided to follow behind the group of experts to see what was going on.</p><p>Hui Yue and the others were aware that they were being followed, but none of them really cared. All that mattered to them was to get to their destination as fast as possible and slaughter as many as they needed so that they could free their friends and loved ones.</p><p>As soon as they started leaving the city, the guards at the gates instantly paused all traffic in and out of the city to allow for the Ling family to smoothly leave the protection of the city walls, and only after they had fully passed through was everyone else allowed to enter and exit.</p><p>As they left the city behind, Hui Yue looked at Ling Fang who continued to rush forward on the dusty road.</p><p>This road at first had nothing to the sides of it apart from the dead bodies of demons and cultivators, alongside mercenaries and other experts who were trying to clear up after the massive battle that had just taken place. The further away from the city they went, the fewer bodies they saw, and slowly the barren wasteland was replaced with fields of medicinal herbs.</p><p>In these fields, many mortals and experts were working. Some were weeding; others were watering. People were overseeing the growth of the plants, and others were watching the workers.</p><p>The plants were treated with the utmost care, and Hui Yue remembered that they said that the Hu and Sun family lived off of growing medicinal herbs. If this was the case, then it was likely that they would be at their destination soon.</p><p>The fields continued onward for a long time. Field after field came into view, and around these fields were small villages for the mortals that could not travel far in a single day.</p><p>After traveling through thousands of medicinal fields, they finally arrived at a larger village. This village was different from the others.</p><p>Where the others had been poor places for mortals to live, this was only considered a village because of its size. Everything was of the finest quality. There were around two hundred small mansions with their own courtyards and then some larger buildings that seemed to have some importance to this family.</p><p>The entire place was enveloped by a large wall, and there was only one gate to enter and leave.</p><p>Above this gate was a name engraved in a large gold plague, and when Hui Yue read it, he saw that they had indeed arrived at the Sun family.</p><p>&quot;Halt, what purpose do you have with our Sun family?&quot; A guard called out, his voice trembling slightly as he tried to maintain his high ground, but before he had the chance to say anything else, a wind blade appeared out of nowhere decapitating him.</p><p>Everyone, friend and foe alike, was stumped for words and stunned into silence.</p><p>They all glanced at Hui Yue not daring to look at him directly as if they feared that if they did, they would provoke some kind of ancient demon and be the next to lose their heads.</p><p>The guard just now had been an Immortal of Creation. He was one of the strongest men in the entire Sun family, but he had died as easily as a chicken would have in the hands of a person who did not even seem to be grown up yet.</p><p>&quot;They have something to hide,&quot; Ling Fang said with a voice that was in no way lowered and allowed for the Sun family to hear what he said. This caused cold sweat to ooze from the remaining guard&apos;s forehead.</p><p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Hui Yue raised an eyebrow, but he did not change his focus from the last guard at all.</p><p>&quot;Usually they will have the younger generation guarding the mansion, but today they have some of their strongest men guarding it. That means that they will use force to block anyone from entering, and if they do not have something to hide, then why would they do this?&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head as he praised Ling Fang for noticing such a detail.</p><p>&quot;You there,&quot; Hui Yue lifted his hand and a wind blade descended towards the neck of the final guard, but instead of decapitating him, it hovered just above his neck, pressing against it. A second after a small trail of blood dripped down.</p><p>&quot;Tell me why is it that you are guarding this entrance, and why isn&#x2019;t it the usual people?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I... I... I... don&apos;t know!&quot; he stuttered as his adam&apos;s apple kept rising and sinking in his throat, and every time it came into contact with the wind blade he would be cut a little more.</p><p>&quot;Tell me what happened when the war broke out? Were you truly neutral?&quot; Hui Yue asked a question that took everyone by surprise. Not only was the guard shocked, but the people who had followed the Ling family were suddenly enlightened.</p><p>The Ling family had fought bravely through the battle, but they had lost many men. The only reason they would be willing to set out like this was to avenge the souls of their fallen heroes.</p><p>&quot;I really don&apos;t know what you are talking about!&quot; the guard started to panic as his eyes darted from one side to another.</p><p>&quot;We were always neutral, definitely neutral, who would betray humanity and side with demons?! If anyone were to do so, may the heavens strike them down!&quot;</p><p>The guard was getting more and more panicked. He was shaking visibly, and his eyes would not look at anyone in particular.</p><p>Everyone present reached the same conclusion. Although he denied it with all his might, he was admitting it with his actions. The guards who had followed behind were all filled with anger. The Sun family being neutral in such a situation was one thing, but if they had taken the side of the Blood Demons then they were basically fighting against the whole city!</p><p>&quot;Well since you are so sure that you have not betrayed humanity, then I am sure you don&apos;t mind that my friends and I enter the Sun family and scour every house to see if you are housing any demons?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That is preposterous, we cannot let anyone enter our family home!&quot; the guard said. Although he was terrified, he was not going to betray his family. For this reason, he kept speaking, but before he had a chance to say anything else, the wind blade that Hui Yue had pressed against his neck exploded and took the guard&apos;s life.</p><p>&quot;Well then, you heard the man. We will enter the Sun family and look everywhere. If there are demons, we will kill them, and if we find our kidnapped women, then we&#x2019;ll release them right away.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue spoke loud enough for everyone, including the men from the city who had followed them, to hear him. They all felt slightly hesitant. Killing someone this easily was not something they could do, but if there were true proof of the Sun family betraying humanity, then they would willingly join the slaughter. Unfortunately, they did not know whether or not such an accusation was true just yet, and they dared not kill just for the sake of killing.</p><p>Hui Yue, on the other hand, did not care. At first, he had taken it with a grain of salt whether or not that this Sun family had betrayed humanity and turned towards the demons, but after hearing the guard&apos;s words, he was completely convinced.</p><p>He was also desperate. He had just resurrected Wang Ju Long and married her, Sha Yun, and Huli. Seeing that one of his wives was now in serious danger, he was filled with regret and riddled with guilt.</p><p>Since he was feeling such negativity, he did not hesitate to slaughter the men who might have the answers for him. To get answers fast, he killed one guard and took the other hostage. It was different from his usual style, but he could not afford to be friendly now that Sha Yun&apos;s life was in danger.</p><p>Hui Yue stepped into the Sun family and noticed that the experts of the sect had gathered together and were looking at him with worry and hate.</p><p>Amongst them were a few experts with purple eyes, and these purple eyes betrayed them as demons.</p><p>&quot;We are not your match hero,&quot; one of the men from the Sun family stepped forward. &quot;But do not think that we cannot fight back. We have a whole legion of Blood Demons here. They are ready to fight to the death; you will not survive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We were aware of you arriving when we initiated the kidnapping, but never would we have expected that you would bring the Ling family with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A legion?&quot; Hui Yue started laughing out loud. His killing intent from deep within boosted by the murderous air he had hidden within him ever since merging with the red wolf caused the surrounding temperature to drop below freezing.</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;m shocked you can house a thousand Blood Demons in this small place,&quot; he grinned, and suddenly hundreds of wind blades appeared behind him.</p><p>The shadows of the members of the Sun family suddenly coiled themselves around the people, keeping them in place as the wind blades descended upon them all, causing screams to sound out from the entire Sun family.</p><p>Hui Yue was strong. He had yet to comprehend a heavenly dao, and he was not the strongest when it came to the major sects, but in smaller sects like these, he was truly too powerful for them to stop.</p><p>&quot;I will deal with the Blood Demons, searching everywhere and see if you can find Sha Yun, Xiao She, and Wan Qiao,&quot; Hui Yue ordered as he began to slaughter his way around the family.</p><p>Everyone he saw was killed. He soon found that the only ones in the sect were men and Blood Demons; all the women and children had long since left the family grounds. It was clear that they had expected that Hui Yue would appear and bring with him chaos and murder.</p><p>&quot;We will overwhelm him!&quot; someone yelled, and ten experts threw themselves at Hui Yue, but he just waved his hand, and wind blades once more appeared and cut through them, leaving no one with a complete corpse.</p><p>&quot;Come at me!&quot; Hui Yue yelled out loud, but everyone seemed to have realized that he was not an easy target; therefore, they all focused on the Ling family members and the friends that Hui Yue had brought with him.</p><p>Unfortunately, these cultivators were all elites of the western region. Although they could not kill as easily as Hui Yue, they still managed to continue the onslaught with no problems. The Sun family was being massacred down to every last person.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
