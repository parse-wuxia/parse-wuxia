Although I wish to kill An He, you doing your best is all I can ask for. Even right now you are doing everything in your power to gain more strength so that we can deal with An He, and to make me my own body. Don&apos;t worry too much and just keep pushing forward! One day we will succeed!&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head. &quot;Stop talking you damn bird,&quot; he said jokingly. &quot;We want to become Immortals of Creation soon, but you have the lead, so why don&apos;t you try and become an Immortal of Creation right now? You only need one more dao!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Lan Feng chuckled, &apos;You have a hard time accepting that I will be the reason you become an Immortal of Creation, huh?&apos; He joked back, but Hui Yue just smiled.</p><p dir="ltr">It was indeed true that at the start, Lan Feng and Hui Yue had raced each other to see who would be the first one to become an Immortal of Creation, but Hui Yue quickly understood the differences between a second and a third generation descendant.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Lan Feng was a second generation descendant of the Vermilion Bird while he was a third generation descendant of the Great Roc.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although it was close, Lan Feng had a far better affinity with the fire element than Hui Yue had with the wind element. It could be seen in how Lan Feng had managed to comprehend the daos much faster than Hui Yue. Although this was the case, Hui Yue did not feel any jealousy. He was, if anything, excited about it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Our souls are connected, and the moment I break through and become an Immortal of Creation you too will become one,&apos; Lan Feng sighed. &apos;For your sake, I will work hard and become an Immortal of Creation very soon, just you wait, this bird might be old, but I am definitely still useful!&apos; he mumbled, more to himself than to Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">Chuckling, Hui Yue stopped the conversation as he saw the phoenix once more enter meditation and start to feel the dao that surrounded him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue spoke with Lan Feng, no one interrupted him. His friends were aware of what he was doing, but the captain and the other guards were always confused about why Hui Yue would suddenly change his facial expression as if he were having a conversation with someone.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They had now left the Celestial Sword Sect behind. All of them were on a ship-shaped shuttle that shot through the galaxy rapidly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue and his friends had been given their own cabins where they could spend their days cultivating. Most of them did just that as they feared that they would be left behind by Hui Yue if they did not train during every waking moment of the day. Because of this Hui Yue and Huli often found themselves on the deck of the shuttle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The ship was covered by a stationary formation and had various defensive inscriptions covering the entire shuttle so that if they were attacked, the shuttle itself would turn out to be very helpful if they ever got into a fight.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Some of these inscriptions had been made by Deng Wu; others had been made by Hui Yue. The formation was one which had been there all the time, but Hui Yue also laid down the thousand layer formation over the ship for extra protection.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They had run into some destroyed shuttles on their way, which had been left behind by bandits but had been destroyed in battles and thus had no more value.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Corpses were often littered on these shuttles, waiting for some scavenger to appear and take the shuttle so that they could sell it as scrap.</p><p dir="ltr">They had also seen multiple groups of bandits, but none of them dared to move against their ship. The strength of the inscriptions and formations were enough to prove that it was impossible to get through if you did not have a substantial force.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the shuttle being incredibly powerful, the men inside the barrier were still wearing their Yanluo Guard uniforms, and thus it was clear to guess that they would not be easy targets.</p><p dir="ltr">Like this, the days went by one after another until finally, they reached the halfway point of their trip. Nothing had happened, and thus some of the guards had laid become more relaxed, but Hui Yue suddenly felt as if something was wrong.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He frowned and looked around. He felt restless; his heart beat faster, and his eyes narrowed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Huli by his side also seemed as if something was wrong and even the guards were restless. They all went around checking the inscriptions and the formations. Their eyes were constantly roaming their surroundings, and their muscles were taut.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Not one was engaged in casual conversation with one another, all of them were tense as they observed their surroundings.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Something is going to happen soon,&quot; Hui Yue said with a low voice as he went into the ship and knocked on his friends&#x2019; doors and woke them from their cultivation.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sorry to awaken you,&quot; he said to each and every one of them, but when they saw the serious expression on his face, and when they felt the tense atmosphere on the ship, no one complained. They all gathered their things and headed straight for the deck of the shuttle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they all gathered, Hui Yue walked up to the deck together with Wan Qiao who was the final person to emerge. When they reached the deck, their faces twisted and some knit their brows together.</p><p dir="ltr">In front of them was a black roiling mist, and no matter which way they chose to go they would have to move through this black mist. For now, they had stalled their advance and were looking at the mist with suspicious eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is a formation,&quot; Hui Yue said after a bit sighing. &quot;This is not a formation that can be made by just anyone either,&quot; he continued speaking, and the faces of everyone present turned ugly.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Either there are three or four apprentices who are creating this mist as a group, or there is a Formations Master out there supporting it. Fortunately, I know how to deal with this black mist, but it will require quite a bit of my soulforce,&quot; Hui Yue said with a sigh. His words caused the face of the captain to tremble.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He was certain that Hui Yue was nothing more than a Primordial Immortal, but even so, he claimed to be able to deal with this formation that was at the Formation Master rank. That would be quite an astonishing feat if he could really accomplish it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not waste any time. He instantly sighed, and eight hundred seals sprung to life around him. If one were to count the seals one would find that there were a total of eight hundred and seventy-four.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Eight hundred of these seals started rotating and placed themselves in a particular pattern in front of Hui Yue who had sat down on the ground and took a deep breath. Then he started to pour his soulforce into the seals in a specific order.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As his soulforce entered the seals, they started shining brightly, and soon it looked like a miniature galaxy had sprung to life around him that had over eight hundred small stars.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the last one was illuminated by his soulforce, the seals suddenly came to life and started merging with one another. When they started merging, they shone with a warmer and stronger light, and their shape turned into that of eight brilliant suns, each bigger than the next.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These eight suns did not waste any time and shot directly past the protective formations on the ship and into the mist in front of them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Screams and shrill shrieks sounded out from within the mist, and the mist itself was becoming smaller and smaller as the suns burned away all its energy.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Want to challenge me at formations?&quot; Hui Yue sneered as he stood up. A cold gleam had appeared in his eyes. &quot;I am afraid you do not have what it takes. In the past fifty years, I have traded every storage item I have been able to find for amazing formations; I am prepared for almost anything.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue looked at the black mist which was constantly being consumed by the suns. As the mist retreated, countless figures were visible right in front of the shuttle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone in front of them had purple eyes. Some had horns while others sharp teeth. Their bodies were of varying sizes. Some were up to three meters while a few were only a meter tall.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their skin color was as different as their bodies; some were fair skinned, some had purple skin, while others still were red or yellow skinned.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing everyone had in common was purple eyes filled with killing intent, and a menacing air surrounded them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although their eyes were filled with killing intent, there was also a bit of solemnity and shock in their eyes as they saw their surrounding cover being thinned and their attempted ambush was being broken.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;An ambush!&quot; The captain&apos;s voice was heavy, and his eyes shone with the intent to fight. He waved his hand, and a sword appeared in his hand as he started waving it back and forth.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only him, but the other Yanluo Guards also picked their weapons and their intent to fight rose to the heavens as their eyes glittered with killing intent.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Targeting the young master?! Not on my watch!&quot; the captain exclaimed with a low growl, and every Yanluo Guard stomped their feet on the deck of the ship as a resounding boom sounded out.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;King Chujiang is our young master! We will never cower from a few demon scum!. We exist to protect our young master, and a bunch of people who play hide and seek dare to threaten us? What a joke! If you truly have guts, come face us. If you dare to mess with King Chujiang than we will see just how long you can keep your petty lives!</p><br></div><p></p>
