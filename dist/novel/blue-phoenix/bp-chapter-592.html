Hui Yue spent all this time getting used to his new body, and as he did, it was soon time for the coronation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue would have liked to talk with the elders of the Celestial Sword Sect before the coronation, but, unfortunately, they did not arrive before it was time to start.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The coronation of a new Judge of Hell was a grand event. Every judge had stayed behind to witness it, and the entire city was standing outside the palace to catch a glimpse of who was to be their new King.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The ceremony itself was fairly simple. Hui Yue was crowned by Yanluo in the main hall of the palace with all the judges, elders from the various sects, and other prominent figures watching in attendance. The elders from the Nightcrawler Sect had also appeared and were seated together with the youth. Although their candidate had not won first place, none of them seemed upset. Their expressions were calm and collected as they watched the coronation without the slightest hint of disdain. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This coronation was simple and straightforward. No one caused trouble, and everyone watched with excitement as they saw Hui Yue crowned the Second King of Hell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Deep within the crowd of people was the young man who had looked at Hui Yue with hostility before. The young man who had volunteered to forfeit the trial when it was time to look into the mirror.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas everyone else seemed to be excited about the coronation, he had a sour expression on his face. His eyes were full of hate, and his lips curled into a sneer.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t think that just because you are the new judge, you will be safe.&quot; He growled ominously before turning to leave. &quot;I will personally kill you, you and that damned bird. You took the Divine Beast World from me, so now I will take everything from you! That woman was just the first calamity to befall you; I will kill everyone around you, one by one, and by the time you realize what has happened, you will be next!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hate spilled from every word the young man said as he vanished into the shadows. &quot;Soon I will be a Grand Demon Lord,&quot; his voice lingered for a short while. &quot;A Grand Demon Lord with control of a Heavenly World! I, An He, will kill anyone who stands in my way, even if I have to sell my soul!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">While An He was fully aware of who Hui Yue was, Hui Yue and Lan Feng had been unaware of An He&apos;s true appearance. Back during the trials, he had been using a face-altering mask, and even Lan Feng had not recognized him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While they were now busy celebrating, An He appeared at the outskirts of town. By his side were Rong Liang and Rong Ming.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If Hui Yue had seen Rong Ming, he would not be able to recognize this young man either. He was now a God, not a new God but a Primordial God. The Ancestral Worldpower within his body was chaotic, and his eyes were filled with a hate similar to the one in An He&apos;s eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Did you see him, Master?&quot; Rong Liang asked, and An He nodded his head. &quot;He succeeded. The one who became the new Judge of Hell is no other than Hui Yue. Since we cannot defeat him by normal means, let everyone know that Hui Yue and Pei Yue are the same person. That he has a treasure so amazing that it can store a whole world and that he is but a mere Primordial Immortal.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although he will be fairly safe, I think that some people will be more than keen on taking the treasures he possesses. So as long as he is within this galaxy, he will be chased! Also, release pictures of his face. This should cause him a headache if nothing else.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&#xA0;While An He was busy planning on how to cause problems for Hui Yue, the man in question was busy accepting guests in the great hall of the palace.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had just become a Judge of Hell, and a great number of guests appeared to congratulate him. Hui Yue, being the host together with Yanluo, walked through the entire hall time and time again taking the time to converse with every single guest.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He spent quite a lot of time together with the Nightcrawler Sect. Although he did not have much to talk about with the elders, he had a great discussion with their youth about the dao of devouring. He was not shy about revealing some of the knowledge he had gained on the subject from his previous lives.</p><p dir="ltr">The blue monk was a figure who had left legacies all over the galaxy, so it was in his nature to guide and support those who had shown him respect and friendship.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth was from another sect, he had always treated Hui Yue with the utmost respect and with friendliness, so Hui Yue had decided to repay him by assisting him with his daos.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having such a discussion, the youth&apos;s eyes shone brightly, and he seemed to become engrossed deeper and deeper in his thoughts. Every word Hui Yue said caused the youth to be enlightened, and even the elders, who were standing at the side, were shocked upon hearing how much he understood of the dao of devouring.</p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, the elders had been shocked when they heard that their youth lost to this unknown cultivator, but now when they heard the conversation between the two, they came to the realization that it was a just loss.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They also realized that their genius had actually gained quite a bit from his fight with Hui Yue. He had gained a much deeper comprehension towards his daos and their ways of being used, and he had matured drastically.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, these elders were very pleased. When Hui Yue left the youth&apos;s side, leaving him to ponder on the insights he had given him, the elders of the Nightcrawler Sect exchanged glances and nodded their heads. The Nightcrawler Sect had always had a good relationship with the Celestial Sword Sect, but now it seemed it was a good time to improve their relationship even more.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After having walked through the room and spoken with each and every guest, Hui Yue finally had the time to visit the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s elders, and he felt relaxed when he saw their proud faces. Although he was used to being alone, there was something comfortable about knowing that he belonged somewhere, that he was actually a member of the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You made us proud!&quot; Pei Ziqi said excitedly as Hui Yue walked towards them. &quot;You really have made us proud! Becoming the Second Judge of Hell is not something just anyone can do!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will hold a great celebration when we return home. We might not be the number one sect, but when we are connected to Diyu, who will dare bully us?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully no one would dare bully the Celestial Sword Sect. Although it was not the strongest Sect around it was one of the strongest. If someone wished to mess with them, they would have to consider it thoroughly. If the Celestial Sword Sect employed all their strength, even the strongest faction, Diyu, would suffer greatly when facing them. If they truly fought, then Diyu would no longer be able to hold the position of the strongest.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not speak much when he met with the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s elders; he just listened to them discussing all the benefits they had gained from him becoming the new judge.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was rather embarrassed hearing all the praise they had for him, but he was quickly rescued by Yanluo, who came and asked Hui Yue to follow him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While they were gone, they had King Qinguang host the party. He was excited the moment he was given the task, and he instantly started rushing around. He ensured that everyone had drinks and that the conversations flowed smoothly. It was clear that he was an experienced host as he rushed around ordering the servants to bring more wine, more snacks, and at the same time chatting away with everyone in the main hall.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Yanluo brought Hui Yue to a small adjourned room where the tables were filled with small jade bottles, scrolls, and medicinal herbs of all kinds.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;These are your coronation gifts from all the guests that showed up,&quot; Yanluo said casually. &quot;Many of them are are medicinal pills and plants. There are a few Ancestral Worldpower Skills, but considering you are an alchemist, I assume you are most interested in the plants and herbs.&quot; Yanluo chuckled.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not question how he knew that he was an alchemist as it seemed that Yanluo knew everything about him. Instead, he headed straight for the items and smiled greatly as he started looking over them. Many of these herbs were herbs that could not be found in the Divine Beast World, and the formulas he had stolen from the expert within the Grave of the Unknown relied on these herbs to be created! Hopefully, with these plants, he would finally be able to advance his dao of alchemy.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Since you are so keen on herbs, why don&apos;t we gift you some as well?&quot; Yanluo laughed as he waved his hand and a mountain of herbs appeared in front of him. Every one of them was in a glass bottle, jade case, or similar container so that they did not lose their medicinal properties.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This gift should last you a few years worth of concocting pills. Consider it the second present from me to you,&quot; Yanluo said with a smile, and Hui Yue&apos;s eyes turned big and shone with excitement.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although this was nowhere near as priceless as the new body he had gotten it was something that he would not look down upon. He quickly waved his hand placing everything from the room inside the Universe Box.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Yanluo already knew about the Universe Box, so his face did not reveal any surprise when everything vanished into thin air.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There is one more benefit for you, but you will have to wait to get it,&quot; Yanluo said as he stretched his body. &quot;After this coronation, we will go back to Youdu. There you will meet Master. He will answer any questions you may have about your dead wife.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head in understanding. This was truly a one time chance for him, and he needed to use it to the fullest. He had to resurrect Wang Ju Long!</p><p dir="ltr">Soon after, he and Yanluo both returned to the palace&#x2019;s main hall where all the guests were entertaining themselves with King Qinguang leading the conversation, talking about old anecdotes from his life and laughter could be heard together with the indistinct sound of voices everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue quickly went back to the area where the Celestial Sword Sect was standing together at the party, and he stayed with them for the rest of the evening. He had a cup of wine in his hand and just stood at the side, smiling slightly.</p><p dir="ltr">By his side was Pei Ze. He said nothing and his usually bubbly personality was completely hidden underneath a mask of seriousness.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">On Hui Yue&apos;s other side was Pei Feng. Although Pei Feng was seemingly uncaring about what was going on, it was clear that he was anything but happy with how things had turned out. Even if he usually just killed the people in his way, he knew that killing Hui Yue would be simply impossible. But even so, he was not willing to just give up. He had sacrificed too much to become the new Sect Leader! He would do anything for the only position that mattered in his life! He would even sell his soul to the devil if that is what it took!&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
