Fortunately, all of them were King ranked experts so they could see the stage no matter where they were seated, and thus they decided to just take some seats at the back.</p><br><p><span style="">The moment they sat down a servant appeared by their side. &quot;Excuse me, to bid at this auction you need to put a down payment of fifty gold coins for the ones who wish to participate in the auction. Each person will be given a number and a sign which you raise when you wish to give a bid. The fifty gold coins will be taken from the price you end up paying for our goods. Unfortunately, the money is nonrefundable should you not buy anything.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Do you want two numbers, one for each one of you?&quot; The woman asked, but Hui Yue laughed at her question. &quot;Four is fine,&quot; He said, and with a flick of his hand, the coins appeared which he traded for four numbers. The woman gave a long glance towards Jo and Lao, and her heart shook when she noticed their auras. At first, she had noticed that there were great auras in this group, but she assumed it was from the two adults. Only by looking closer at the children did she feel their overwhelming auras. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Her heart shook with fear. She was a Master ranked cultivator, and she had worked hard cultivating. She was very proud of reaching such a rank by the age of twenty, yet these two children in front of her seemed to be very young, and their auras easily surpassed hers. Seeing them, her heart was so shocked that she instantly handed over the numbers to both of them and treated them as she would her parents.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Accepting the cards neither of the family members paid more attention to the servant, and she rushed away, her mind completely shaken. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Is there anything specific which caught your interest?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously while looking at the other three while waiting for the auction to start. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I saw some poisonous pills,&quot; Wang Ju Long said with a smile on her face. &quot;The poisons are far better than the previous ones that I have seen so, of course, they interest me.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Nodding his head, Hui Yue understood her interest. He had skimmed past the poison pills because they held no interest to him, but for Wang Ju Long they were truly valuable.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue wished to offer her more coins, but he knew it was already amazing that she had accepted the ten spirit coins he gave her earlier. She would not express her thanks because she knew if she did, then the children would have refused the money. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Now, however, she would say no. She was stubborn about the money she had earned while healing other experts and she thought she had enough money on her own. Hui Yue had this so many times that it was etched into his mind. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Sighing he gave up before he even said anything and instead looked at Lao and Jo who were sitting between the two adults. Both of them held their number in their hand and flipped through the catalog. Their eyes shone as they read what each and every pill did. Some pills kept their interest while others were quickly passed.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Any pill which could increase their cultivation base was instantly ignored because they had the golden pills at their disposal. At the same time, they also skipped past the red pills and other energy restoring pills. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I need to get some Yang pills,&quot; Jo mused to herself. &quot;Father has plenty of Yin pills, but now that I am a King ranked cultivator, I need lots of Yang energy.&quot; Although she was mumbling, Hui Yue heard the words and nodded his head. Another coin storage Stone appeared and flew to Jo.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;There are another ten spirit coins in here. Now, in total you have twenty spirit coins. Buy all the Yang pills you can get.&quot; He said seriously. &quot;This is very important for your cultivation. I will try to learn how to make them, but it will take me some time. You are right that you need pills like these, I am sorry I didn&apos;t think about it before,&quot; Hui Yue apologized. He truly felt sorry as he had given Lao ten Yin pills, but nothing was given to Jo. She needed to balance her energies as much as Lao.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it father,&quot; Jo said happily. &quot;I cannot imagine how long it would have taken me to reach the King rank without your assistance, not to mention that I would never have been able to consume that pill had it not been for Uncle Feng. Without him, I would have had to let all the energy leave my body due to the overwhelming pain.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue nodded his head because what she said true. At first, he had expected Silvermoon&apos;s Pill to be a strong pill that anyone would kill to gain. However, these pills were mainly given to children Jo&apos;s age in the heavenly realms, but the pain was indeed very excruciating so much so that it was very hard for a child to accept such levels of pain. This was true not only in the heavenly realms but even more so here in a world where children did not start cultivating until they were around seven or eight years old. And that was only the age when noble children to started to cultivate, the citizens of many cities did not start until they were around ten years of age. </span></p><br><p><span style="">In the heavenly realms, the children prepared to use Silvermoon&apos;s Pill by the time they turned five. The first five years of their lives were used to prepare for the pill. After they turned five, they would take Silvermoon&apos;s Pill and their strength, maturity, and intelligence would soar above the nine heavens; they would then start their cultivation from a rank similar to the King rank of this plane. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;What about you Lao?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously. &quot;Is there anything that caught your attention?&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Lao kept looking through the leaflet and shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; He said truthfully. &quot;I am interested in some of these pills that help with one&#x2019;s elemental affinities. Although my foundation is solid from Silvermoon&apos;s Pill, I do not have a great affinity with my elements.&quot; Lao mused.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue nodded in agreement. &quot;Jo, you should also buy some of those pills. If you guys do not have enough, I&apos;ll give you more. These pills are very important for your future.&quot; He said seriously, and after some time the two children nodded their heads.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Their cultivation was something they did not wish to jeopardize; they wanted to become stronger and stronger, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of Hui Yue.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Time went by quickly, and the four of them joked amongst each other as all the seats around them started to fill up. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Experts from the sky would frequently appear on flying swords and descend. Many of these experts had already reserved seats at the front, and they were filled with arrogance as they took their seats. Many looked at them with reverence, but Hui Yue had to hold back his laughter. All of them looked so smug, yet Hui Yue knew that the flying swords they had were actually horrible. Their swords were so ordinary that they would without a doubt break after some time because the swords were unable to handle the constant Wu Wei. Hui Yue did not care about this as he could just provide the Black Market Auction House with more flying swords to sell.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As the final person descended from the sky, a beautiful woman appeared on stage. This woman, Hui Yue instantly recognized as the woman in control of the exams. However, today she was wearing a form-fitting green gown. A dress that showed off her curves as her hair cascaded down her back and around her face. She was incredibly attractive, but Hui Yue only appreciated her beauty, he did not lose his mind like many other males present. Seeing her, a smile appeared on his face.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Welcome everyone to this year&#x2019;s annual pill auction!&quot; The woman started. Her voice sounded clear in the ear of everyone present. Seeing that she was able to use her energy like this, Hui Yue knew that she was an Emperor. It was obvious that the higher rank one was as an alchemist, the higher rank their cultivation would be as well. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;This year we will have a total of seven auctions. The first auction will be held today. All ladies and gentlemen in attendance, you have received our leaflet and today we will start with item number one. The first item to be auctioned is a set of twelve Crystallized Hymn Pills. These pills allow for one to heal injuries they have sustained. These Crystallized Hymn Pills are all rank five pills. These pills only take ten minutes to heal almost any type of wound. Because this is only a rank five pill, It does not restore energy.&#x201D;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Let us start the auction with fifty gold coins for this set of twelve pills!&quot; The lady&#x2019;s alluring voice echoed out. Quite a few numbers were raised, and the battle for the pills was rather intense in first few minutes before it quickly died out. There was after all four sets of these Crystallized Hymn Pills, and they sold incredibly quick.</span></p><br><p><span style="">One pill after another was brought forth, but these pills held no interest with Lao, Jo, or Wang Ju Long. They all wished to purchase the high ranked pills, and those would be the last pill up for auction today.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As they waited and watched, Hui Yue and his small family were busy observing the people around them. They looked at who purchased which items, and who was not buying any items. </span></p><br><p><span style="">They had quite a lot of patience, and they had fun watching everyone in the square. Sometimes they got a sour look back and hurried onto another person, other times they got a smile and smiled back in response. There were many people present who were waiting for the final pills, the higher ranked ones.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Finally, the stage cleared and a few guards appeared with a jade case. Now the pills were no longer were sold as a package of twelve. Instead, they were sold individually. Their rank was so high that if they were sold in batches, not many would be able to join the bidding war, and they would lose money.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Here we have a poison pill known as the Butterfly&apos;s Pearl. It is named such as there is a picture of a butterfly imprinted upon the pill. This poison pill is so potent that anyone who eats it will die within three days. There is no way to trace this poison, nor is there any cure for it. We start the price at fifty gold coins!&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing the explanation, Hui Yue saw Wang Ju Long&apos;s eyes glow with excitement. It was clear that she was like a child on Christmas Eve. He found her behavior so adorable that he could not help but laugh. Fortunately, Wang Ju Long did not have time to look at him as she was focused on the pill in front of her; this was a pill that she really wanted.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
