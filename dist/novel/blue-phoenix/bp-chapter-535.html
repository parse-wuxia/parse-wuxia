All of them were slightly nervous as they knew that Hui Yue and the others most likely had started fighting against an unknown enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t worry; they have three people. Two of them are genuine Immortals of Creation, one of them even have already grasped a major dao! They will be fine.&quot; The bull said with certainty, and his words caused everyone to nod their heads. Although they were worried, they were not too worried.</p><p dir="ltr">The most worried in the group was Xiao She. Most of the time she would pretended that she felt nothing for Lan Feng, and since Lan Feng who was within Hui Yue was busy cultivating rather than talking to her, she did everything she could to appear as if it did not matter to her. Unfortunately, now that she knew that Hui Yue, and therefore Lan Feng, were fighting, her heart was beating quickly, and she was feeling very uneasy. She kept telling herself how unlikely it was for anything to be wrong as Cai Jie and Huli were by his side, but even so, she could not completely ease her heart.</p><p dir="ltr">As she looked into the distance, her eyes suddenly noticed a group of experts coming their way. At first, she was jubilant, but moments after she was worried. It was not just three people flying their way but five!</p><p dir="ltr">Xiao She was not the only one who noticed the approaching experts, everyone saw them. This caused them to frown. They all instantly recognized Hui Yue, Huli, and Cai Jie, but the last two they did not know.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the many Gods ahead the two Fu brothers were all smiles, and there was no threatening feeling to them. When they sensed the many beast Gods, they could feel that three of them were Immortals of Creation and were impressed by the power of Hui Yue&apos;s group.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If they knew that these three experts knew only one or two daos, they would be greatly surprised as this was highly unheard of.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they reached the group, Hui Yue flew ahead. &quot;Please do not be alarmed,&quot; he said as he spread out his hands.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;These two are the Fu brothers, Fu Ziyu and Fu Jinyan. They are from the Celestial Sword Sect and are here to assist us in reaching Diyu safely.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing the Celestial Sword Sect&#x2019;s name, the two Fu brothers expected to see some kind of reverence or fear in the eyes of the many beast Gods, but they just frowned and looked at Hui Yue with curiosity.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Is the Celestial Sword Sect very strong?&quot; Tang Tian, the flood dragon, asked curiously, and when they heard this question, the two brothers almost fell from the sky in shock. Where were these bumpkins from? To have stepped into the Immortal of Creation ranks without ever hearing about the almighty Celestial Sword Sect... Was this even possible?</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the shock in the eyes of the two Fu brothers, Hui Yue smiled sheepishly and scratched his head in embarrassment.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We all come from the same minor world,&quot; he explained. &quot;We have never gone out to travel through the vast galaxy before, all we did was train at home.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, the Fu brothers were even more shocked. Hui Yue, Huli, and Cai Jie&#x2019;s auras pressured them and gave them the feeling that they should not fight them. Although both of them were Gods of Creation, they felt that Huli and Cai Jie had command of a rather high amount of daos, and not to mention the freak Hui Yue who knew both soulforce and the dao of space!</p><p dir="ltr">Just what kind of monsters were these other nine Gods? They did not know, but the Fu brothers decided that it was best to be incredibly polite and not in any way insult these other Gods that they would be traveling with.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue smiled as he noticed their expression, but he said nothing to make them understand that these Gods were actually not so terrifying.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having caught up, Hui Yue quickly explained to the beast Gods what had happened. He explained that a third person had followed behind them and that he was killed instantly by the Fu brothers after which they swore an oath on the heavenly dao that they would protect Hui Yue on his way to Diyu.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As for why they wanted to protect him, Hui Yue was aware that it had to do with the young master he had seen at the party, the young man known as Pei Ze. He knew that these experts of the Celestial Sword Sect were interested in him because of the so-called control over the dao of space he had shown alongside the fact that he had soulforce.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Since the Celestial Sword Sect was certain that he was one of their own, Hui Yue was treated incredibly politely by the Fu brothers. During their trip, Hui Yue flew by their side most of the time talking with them about the sect.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Can you tell me about the Celestial Sword Sect?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously. &quot;I had never heard about it before I entered Skydragon Fortress, perhaps you can help me prepare for when I meet them in Diyu?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Fu brothers were aware that Hui Yue knew what they had spoken with Pei Ze about, and they were very pleased that he was not trying to avoid meeting the sect, and that he even paid it extra attention.</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue was flying with the Fu brothers, Cai Jie was catching up with the nine beast Gods and Huli was right by Hui Yue&apos;s side. She said nothing but she did not leave his side either. Her eyes constantly watched the Fu brothers because she did not fully trust them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In this galaxy, there are eight sect known as the most powerful sects because each and every one of them contains a constellation.&quot; Fu Ziyu explained.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The ancestor of the Celestial Sword Sect is a great roc, and he gave up his body to create the great roc constellation above the planet.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Not many have the chance to form a constellation, but those who do can give up their body in exchange for becoming the world&#x2019;s guardian.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Celestial Sword Sect&#x2019;s world is ranked number four on the heavenly rankings, and the entire world is the home of our sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The Celestial Sword Sect consists of those direct disciples who have the blood of the great roc running through them.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Other than direct disciples and the inner sect there are the ten guardian sects. Anyone who shows talent, but does not have the bloodline of the great roc can apply to become a member of the guardian sects. Some guardian sects consist of the families of many generations but us Fu brothers were talented enough to be taken into one of the guardian sects.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The pride in Fu Ziyu&apos;s voice was clear, and Hui Yue could understand why. Although he did not know much about the ranked worlds, he did know that being fourth on the heavenly ranking was indeed very impressive. He could never have imagined that the Celestial Sword Sect commanded so much power.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; Fu Jinyan opened his mouth to speak, something that did not happen often and because of this when he did speak, Hui Yue was even more eager to hear what he had to say.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although it is illegal to have children outside of the sect, there are always exceptions. Even though you are the result of someone breaking sect rules, you are someone with so much ability that the Celestial Sword Sect will most likely completely ignore the whole heritage issue.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Hui Yue was at first a little worried. If they were to know that his parents were completely human, they would definitely be shocked. Then they would start to wonder, how could he possess the wings of a Celestial Sword Sect member?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If they were not going to ask about his heritage that would be for the best; however, what was he going to say when they found out that he was also a magical beast. Although he wished to hide the fact that he could transform into a magical beast, he was quite certain that when it came to the trial, he would have to display all of his abilities, and thus, he would have to turn into a wolf. By then, what would they think?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking his head, Hui Yue sighed to himself. He would just have to wait and see what happened. Perhaps they would come up with some excuse on their own. Hui Yue really did not know, he just hoped for the best.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Everyone,&quot; Hui Yue suddenly called out, and everyone who was present looked at Hui Yue as they all continued to fly forward.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&#x2019;t mention anything about my parents to anyone. Don&apos;t even talk about them amongst yourselves,&quot; he ordered. Although the Fu brothers heard him, they did not really care too much.</p><p dir="ltr">They found it natural. Having heard that they had broken a sect rule, it was only natural for him to want to protect his parents. If they spoke about his parents to someone, were they not asking the sect to punish them for their wrongdoings? Not talking about the subject was, therefore, the most suitable decision.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, the beasts were confused as to why Hui Yue said such a thing, but after looking at the Fu brothers they quickly guessed that this had something to do with them and the Celestial Sword Sect. All of them just nodded their heads in response. If Hui Yue asked them to do something, even when he did not give any explanation for why, they would follow his order.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they continued their journey, Hui Yue asked more questions about the Celestial Sword Sect. He soon found that there were around three thousand members of the actual main sect including the patriarch and the elders while the guardian sects had around five thousand in each sect.</p><p dir="ltr">The planet that the Celestial Sword Sect resided upon was about half the size of the Netherworld. Although it had the ten guardian sects and the Celestial Sword Sect also had a great many mortals living and taking care of the world. It even had multiple kingdoms and empires, but even so, everyone knew that the Celestial Sword Sect was the true hegemon of the world. Even if the smallest disciple of the main sect wished to change a king or emperor, they could do so.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue also got to know that although the direct disciples were many, there was a rank to these disciples.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The patriarch held the highest rank in the family; then there were a total of ten grand elders and a hundred elders. After were the direct disciples of the elders and then the ordinary disciples.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although they were called disciples, they could be as young as ten years old, but also thousands of years old. As long as one did not become an elder, one would stay a disciple of the Celestial Sword Sect even after they married and had kids of their own.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Only specific members were allowed to marry members from outside the sect, and usually, these women were chosen from the most outstanding and talented young women of the guardian sects.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having traveled for a long time, Hui Yue started to understand more about this sect which his previous life had been a part of.</p><br></div><p></p>
