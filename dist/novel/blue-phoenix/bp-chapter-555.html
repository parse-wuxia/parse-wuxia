Neither of them spoke, but where Pei Ze was completely calm and looking straight ahead, Hui Yue was busy looking around observing the bustling life of Youdu.</p><p dir="ltr">The red moonlight shone down upon the city creating an eerie atmosphere as souls and demons made their way through the busy streets.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Some souls were busy selling items and food; some were setting up stalls while others were packing down their stalls. There was no day here far beneath the surface, and everything was one long night filled with the color of blood. If one were here for too long, then it would be easy to lose track of time.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was eager to learn about this new world, but even more so, he was eager to get to the banquet. This was a banquet held by Yanluo himself, and such a banquet meant that maybe he could meet the King of Hell, himself, and ask him about how to resurrect Wang Ju Long.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had no actual interest in becoming a Judge of Hell. All he wanted was to resurrect Wang Ju Long. If he could do so without entering the trials then obviously he would. He knew his limitations, and he was only willing to gamble it all if he had no other choice.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing that Hui Yue was deep in thought, Pei Ze gently nudged him and brought him back to reality. They had walked through street after street and after a while arrived at a gigantic black palace. Within all of Youdu only one palace was bigger than this one, the forbidden palace. A palace where no one tread unless they had been personally invited by Yanluo.</p><p dir="ltr">This black palace though was bursting with life. There were new experts arriving constantly in large groups similar to the size of Celestial Sword Sect&#x2019;s.</p><p dir="ltr">Every single group looked upon the others with arrogance. They each felt that their own sect was the best and that they could fight the others easily. Still within their arrogance was a slight trace of uncertainty and curiosity when they looked at the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p dir="ltr">The Celestial Sword Sect was one of the strongest sects in the entire galaxy, and they were famed for their aerial combat. They were feared in spars and often won the battles they participated in.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">But this time there was a difference. This time the bastard of the Celestial Sword Sect had arrived. He was new to the sect and for some reason had been allowed to live. His name, Pei Yue, had already spread through Youdu and was also spreading throughout the entire galaxy as they understood that this young man was special.</p><p dir="ltr">Although this was the case, he was still new to the sect. Therefore everyone knew that the usual sect skills such as aerial combat were not his forte.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting him would make it possible to trample on the Celestial Sword Sect, and everyone set him as their target.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors of this white-haired young man&#x2019;s appearance had spread to all the great sects, and everyone was looking for this specific youngster. But when they saw him, everyone was stopped in their tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only did he not cower in fear, but he was proudly walking next to Pei Ze. His face was held high, and he had an air of arrogance to him as he took step after step forward. His clothes were of the best quality, and his appearance was the epitome of a young master. Was this person really the so called bastard of the Celestial Sword Sect? If he were a bastard, would he walk with his head held high and even be looked at with respect by his peers?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">No one outside the Celestial Sword Sect knew that Hui Yue was of the third generation. All they knew was that Hui Yue was a bastard that had been allowed to enter the sect, the specifics were something no outsider knew as the sect kept it to themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">This was also one of the reasons that everyone looked down upon Hui Yue. Had they known that he was a third generation descendant then the eyes that looked at him would be filled with fear.</p><p dir="ltr">The two ancestors and the patriarch were legendary figures renown throughout the galaxy. They had roamed the world, fought their enemies, and carved their names into history. To be of the third generation meant that he was the child of one of them, and knowing this, no one would want to attack him just out of fear of retaliation from the terrifying second generation, the leading generation, of the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue completely ignored the many experts looking at him and snorted inside. The young generation of the Celestial Sword Sect had truthfully stunned Hui Yue when he met them. They were indeed very strong, but even so, Hui Yue only feared fighting a few of them such as Pei Ze and Pei Feng as it would take quite the effort if he wanted to beat them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">But when looking at the many experts around him, he could tell all of them were weaker than the younger generation of the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">That was until his eyes landed on a group where everyone was wearing simple black clothes. Their bodies were filled with Ancestral Worldpower, and when Hui Yue scanned them with his soulforce, he found that their strength was even more profound than he first thought.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Just as he was scanning them, his soulforce was abruptly cut off as something shielded the entire group, and Hui Yue was surprised when he saw one of their elders looking at Hui Yue with sharp eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">Noticing his eyes Hui Yue cupped his hands and bowed in apology, and the stern expression on the elder&apos;s face softened somewhat when he saw his respectful apology.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the elders of the Celestial Sword Sect followed Hui Yue&apos;s line of sight, and their eyes turned serious as they looked at the black clothed group.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That is the Nightcrawler Sect. They are ranked just beneath the Netherworld in the galaxy, and their younger generation are the only ones who can fight us in aerial combat well. Try to avoid them if you can, and if you can&apos;t do your best to not embarrass yourself.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze&apos;s voice came from the side with brutal honesty. Hearing that they were the strongest sect in the galaxy, it made good sense for Hui Yue that they had an elder who had soulforce and he felt excited. Although these experts were strong, Hui Yue still had faith in himself. He might be a new God, but everyone present was of the younger generation. In the end, everyone of this generation was limited in how long they had been able to consume Ancestral Worldpower and comprehend the dao. Although they had Ancestral Worldpower skills, they could not rival Hui Yue when it came to having comprehended three complete daos.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Next to the soulforce elder was a young man. He was clearly the most outstanding younger generation member of the Nightcrawler Sect, and his eyes landed on Hui Yue. Deep within his black eyes were doubt and curiosity.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Noticing the staring gaze of this expert, Hui Yue nodded his head before he once more looked forward and followed the elders of the Celestial Sword Sect through the gates entering the black palace.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The elders seemed to know their way around the palace, and they headed straight for a small building that was to the side of the main building.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This building was filled with lights that shone out through open windows. Chattering could be heard from within that drifted out with the light alongside the sound of a zither being played.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The elders headed straight for this building and entered inside. Their faces were filled with pride, and their backs were straight as they walked with a noble air. Behind them, every single member of the Celestial Sword Sect was standing proud. They were well known, and it was only natural for them to have this arrogance when walking.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">At the very front Pei Ze, Hui Yue, and Pei Feng were walking together side by side. Originally Hui Yue should not have walked with them, but due to his rank as a third generation descendant he was even entitled to be ahead of them, but he was happy by their side. Together the three entered the mansion right behind the head elders.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as the Celestial Sword Sect entered the banquet hall many of the speaking experts turned quiet as they turned to look at these new arrivals.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Some in the hall bowed slightly, others cupped their hands, and some nodded their heads in respect greeting these newcomers.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While everyone was looking at them with curiosity, many eyes landed on Hui Yue. He was clearly the bastard, but he was allowed to walk with Pei Ze and Pei Feng, two absolute geniuses of their generation. This caused quite some turmoil in the hearts of many experts present.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue looked around, and unlike the others, he did not feel too important. What he was there for was not the many sparring matches that the younger generation geniuses were looking forward to.</p><p dir="ltr">Many assumed that he wished to display his skills, wished to show his sect that he was truthfully a genius and assumed that he also wanted the fight, but the elder from the Nightcrawler Sect frowned slightly. There was something uncomfortable about this youth; something that made even him feel threatened.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Welcome!&quot; A loud voice reverberated through the banquet hall and turning to look at the voice, Hui Yue felt his heart skip a beat.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the hall was a raised podium with a big throne and within this chair was a young-looking man. This man had long black hair; his skin was without any wrinkles, but his eyes were deep and seemed as if they contained eons of knowledge making it difficult to describe the feeling they gave.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking into the eyes of this man, Hui Yue understood that he was actually nowhere as young as he seemed and that this person in front of him was as old as the galaxy itself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The old man looked at Hui Yue with curiosity similar to the many other families, but where the others seemed to be unable to see through him, Yanluo&apos;s eyes saw right through his every secret. It was as if his innermost thoughts were exposed and all his secrets, including the nine past lives in his core, were ripped out and displayed for Yanluo to see.</p><p dir="ltr">The expression on Yanluo&apos;s face turned to shock as he looked at Hui Yue. Though it showed but for an instant on his face, it was caught by a few discerning elders in the room. Everyone who noticed this was shocked to their core as they had never before seen Yanluo lose control of his expression the way he just had.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearing his throat, Yanluo knew that he had made a mistake, but he was truly shocked to the core just now. He was the God of Hell, and here was a person who had managed to find the memories of his previous lives something which should be impossible unless a certain event had happened...</p><br></div><p></p>
