Although he had retracted his Overlord aura, there was an air around him that called for respect. Therefore no one wished to accidentally interrupt him, so even when he finished speaking, no one dared to open their mouths.</p><p>&quot;Some of you are from the same generation as me,&quot; Yama said with his archaic voice, and a few of them nodded their heads. &quot;Others are younger. Some have already passed the prime of their lives. Some have reached the apex while others are starting to shine just now. Some are tired and exhausted while others are eager and filled with energy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me start with a story.&quot; Yama continued to speak; his words carried such weight that everyone felt their minds tremble just listening to him.</p><p>&quot;Long ago Pangu was born. He was born in a different galaxy very far away from this one. He lived a life where martial arts was the most important thing to him, and after many years upon years of cultivating, he reached the rank of Overlord and then he was able to transcend the limits of the galaxy in which he had been born.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He traveled throughout the universe, visited countless galaxies, and saw everything possible to one could see.&quot;</p><p>&quot;One day, when he had seen it all and had turned exhausted with his vast travels, he found a place in the void and created our galaxy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In this galaxy, Pangu created life. He created worlds. He created the whole power system!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Together with this, he also created the circle of life and Diyu. Some of us were of the first generation of living beings created by Pangu and were lucky enough to have known him and we consider him our Royal Father.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He watched as the galaxy he had birthed grow and change. It evolved, new experts were born and others were created. New races appeared every day, and one of these races were the demons.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The demons were created for the sake of helping out in Diyu. They were born, or created, as Immortals of Creation or Primordial Immortals with the ability to command the daos.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They were born strong, but as a result, they could not advance in their cultivation after birth. These demons were the best workers; they were faithful and hardworking. They enjoyed their jobs, but as time went on and more and more experts throughout the galaxy appeared to become stronger and stronger, the demons started to feel unhappy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They would never be able to become stronger than they were at birth, and they saw everyone around them constantly improving their strength. They saw the martial world filled with fanatics who thought of nothing, but how to improve themselves, however, the demons could never do such a thing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Slowly the demons started to split into two groups. One was bitter and unhappy; they blamed their creator for having created them as a race that could never improve, a race that could not advance, search for the apex, or in some way have something to chase after. They wished for more than just their everyday life as workers that served a world, but were unable to truly belong there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They were immortals, they had strength, but the majority were mediocre, and this mediocrity was something they could never change. They were filled with rage, but they could do nothing about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The fraction of demons that held this mentality came to be called the Blood Demons, and they slowly withdrew from Diyu. They were excused from their work and found a world for themselves where they settled down. They did not welcome anyone in this world apart from other demons who condemned their creator.&quot;</p><p>Slowly more and more demons sought out this place, and they took on the name Blood Demons. Although their name was ferocious, and although they were filled with a vengeance, no one took them seriously. No one really felt that they were a threat since they were born with a certain strength that could never grow.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, it turned out that these demons had a few offspring which were born with control over quite a lot of daos, and it was on the back of these children that the Blood Demons placed their entire hopes and expectations of the future.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Years went by, one millennium after another flashed by in an instant, and more and more demons had joined the Blood Demons. By now they were more than ten million strong, and the amount of outstanding youths had grown tremendously. Although they were not a group with enough power to endanger the entire galaxy, they would soon be able to cause some serious problems.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then it happened. One day a demon child was born. He was the strongest of them all, and he was born an Overlord!&quot;</p><p>&quot;This child became the golden child of the Blood Demons. He was the one tool that the elders of the Blood Demons wished to use for gaining the upper hand in the galaxy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;By now Pangu had left the galaxy, and the strongest expert was Nuwa, one of Pangu&#x2019;s first creations and also the creator of the human race.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nuwa was no Overlord. She was halfway to the Overlord rank, but she had not reached it yet, something which gave the Blood Demons hope for success. If they waited a few years for this demon to grow up, then they would be able to take over the entire galaxy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Blood Demons quickly changed.&quot; Yama paused for some time as he looked at everyone in the room. He saw faces that were reminiscing old days as well as younger faces which seemed completely swallowed up in the story that he told, and he was secretly excited. The more these people were enthralled by his story, the easier it would be to convince them to join him in his crusade against the demons later on.</p><p>&quot;The Blood Demons changed. At the start, they were but a group who felt wronged. They wished to find a way to allow for themselves to change their predestined fate, but as time went on their original vengeance towards their creator changed towards a hate of all the other races.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They felt bitter and hateful. They too wished to pursue the apex; they wished to increase their strength. They too wished to be a part of the martial world, however, it was impossible for them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since this was the case, they wished to cause havoc. They wished to destroy the galaxy. They wished to make every other race their slaves and let them experience the suffering they had gone through. They wanted to massacre those who looked down upon them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The young boy who was born an Overlord grew up in a sheltered home. He had everything he could ever ask for. He grew up as a prince of the demons, everyone revered him, and he quickly learned to abuse his powers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It did not take long before he learned that he was special. He understood that he was above all others, and soon he felt superior to other cultivators. Even those who were humans or beasts, spirits or ghosts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Time went by while he was growing up and soon five hundred years had passed since his birth. In this time the Blood Demons had been preparing. They had been getting ready to act, and when they were finally prepared, they started a bloody massacre.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They went from world to world and killed everyone and everything on the worlds, mortals and immortals alike. They laid waste to one world after another. They simply destroyed them and went on to the next world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They took all of us by surprise. They had been killing everyone, so there was no one to bring any news of these killings to the rest of the galaxy, however when someone noticed the dead worlds the rumors started spreading and soon everyone knew what was going on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The rest of the galaxy, all the other races, were enraged by what they had seen. Their brothers had been slaughtered, their worlds laid to waste.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This was the beginning of the Great Demon War. A war which raged for a full thousand years.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We had the divine beasts on our side; we also had Nuwa and Fuxi, the sister and brother pair. We had me and a few of you old timers too. There were many of the ancestors of the different sects, and many beasts and humans who had been created by Pangu appeared in the war, but everyone was pushed back while fighting the demon Overlord.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We could manage against the demons themselves, even the strongest of the Blood Demons were easily manageable, all except the one person who was born an Overlord.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As said before, the war raged for a full thousand years. Everyone was playing hide and seek. Wherever the Overlord went, death and misery followed. The ones who fought for humanity would strike at the Blood Demons and then hide again as soon as their attack was finished.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everything culminated in a massive final battle, a battle where it was impossible to flee, impossible to retreat. It was kill or be killed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Under this pressure, Nuwa, Fuxi, and I managed to use the pressure to transcend into the realms of Overlords.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thus the war ended. We managed to severely injure the Blood Demon Overlord, but unfortunately, it was impossible to kill him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Time went by, so much time that most of the veterans of the Great Demon War have either passed away, left the galaxy, or gone into seclusion.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We all thought that the war had ended for good, but now the Blood Demons are on the move again. We wish to deal with them as soon as possible, and we do not wish to cause the same problems as before. We want to eradicate the Blood Demons!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We understood their original aim to understand and try to surpass the limitations that have been placed on them, but now they are filled with hate! Now that they are doing everything in their power to kill all the other races, to slaughter and massacre everyone, then we too will do the same; They kill us, so we kill them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now you know why I summoned you all here. Please tell me, are you with me in the fight against the Blood Demons, or are you going to hide in your world and hope that you will be able to survive on your own?&quot;</p><p>Yama stopped speaking. The final words had been like thunder in the ears of all present. Were they going to be joining Diyu or would they succumb to the Blood Demons? That was the true question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will join you!&quot; Someone said as he stood up. His face was flushed red, and his eyes burned with an intensity to fight. &quot;I don&apos;t know how much I can do, but I will send my guards and family members as a part of the army. I too will join the war!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Count me in,&quot; another said as he stood up, and after the second started, everyone else stood up. They all were filled with vigor and excitement. They had listened to Yama&apos;s tale, and they felt excited. Although their foe was outstanding, they still felt that they could win. A defeated enemy would always be defeated.</p><p>Soon everyone was filled with excitement. Yama sat down on his chair once more and looked at the excited experts with a small smile on his lips, and by now Yanluo had stood up.</p><p>He had understood that Yama wanted him to take over, and he instantly stood up and started to organize. There was a lot of organization needed to raise an army, but he was experienced, and he started preparing everyone for what was to come.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
