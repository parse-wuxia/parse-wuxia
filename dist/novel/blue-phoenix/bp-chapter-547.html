Some were fighting each other on the platforms, others were testing their dao attacks on the dummies, and quite a few were running through the obstacle courses.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Some stopped what they were doing when they saw Pei Ze and the large group of experts following him towards the fields; others did not even notice him coming. Especially the many experts who were fighting on the platforms. They were so engrossed in their sparring matches that they did not notice the arrival of Pei Ze and Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze scanned the area with his eyes and nodded his head in approval. The majority of the younger generation was here so he could finish his mission in one go: to inform everyone about Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Waiting patiently for the experts to finish their sparring matches, Pei Ze stood with his arms behind his back looking important.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Every expert from the sparring field walked towards him, even some of the battling experts stopped their sparring match when they noticed people were migrating towards him. It was clear he wanted to say something important to everyone.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Pei Ze did not call out, it only took around half an hour before every single member of the Celestial Sword Sect that was at the sparring field gathered around.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Low mumbling sounds could be heard as they all discussed what they thought Pei Ze was planning to tell them. A lot snuck glances at Hui Yue, and it seemed that the majority understood that it had something to do with him; however, what was so important that Pei Ze himself had to announce it? One had to understand that he was not a normal member of the younger generation.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearing his throat, everyone turned quiet and looked at Pei Ze with fevered gazes. These experts all looked up to Pei Ze almost like a legend. He stood at the pinnacle of power amongst the youngest generation, and only one other person within the younger generation had the strength to challenge him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These two experts were so outstanding that even some members of the older generation could not beat them. It was clear that one day one of these two would become the sect leader when the current sect leader retired.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let me introduce you all to Pei Yue,&quot; Pei Ze said with a clear voice, and his words caused everyone&apos;s eyes to widen, their mouth to gape, and their hearts to shake uncontrollably.</p><p dir="ltr">Although it was a simple sentence, it conveyed so much unspoken information. His name was Pei Yue. Pei. The last name of every direct descendant of the Great Roc. A name one could only have if they were born in the Celestial Sword Sect, but this young man in front of them was clearly someone they had never seen before. How could he have Pei as his last name?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I know you are all shocked,&quot; Pei Ze said calmly as if it did not really affect him as he quickly continued his explanation. &quot;Pei Yue has lived away from the family for his entire life; it is just today that he is joining our family ranks.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He is a new God, but his talents are quite outstanding. One day he will become a great cultivator of our family. He will also be joining us for the trials as well,&quot; Pei Ze continued his explanation, but just as he was about to open his mouth, a very discontent voice spoke out. &quot;He is a bastard born from someone breaking the rules! He should have been killed already, what were the head elders thinking about when they let him live?!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I was just about to explain this,&quot; Pei Ze continued, seemingly not angry with the fact that he was interrupted, but he just shook his head and continued what he had to say.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Yue previous name was Hui Yue before he joined our family. Pei Yue is a third-generation descendant of the great roc and the direct nephew of the patriarch and our ancestors.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as these words were spoken, an uproar exploded. &quot;He is clearly a new God, a God born from at least one mortal parent! How can he possibly be a third generation descendant? He is obviously cheating somehow!&quot; One of the experts in the audience exclaimed, but Hui Yue completely ignored them. He noted who it was, but he did not retort.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze, on the other hand, frowned rather badly before he looked at the person who had spoken. &quot;The five head elders who are here alongside the patriarch themselves observed Pei Yue&apos;s wings and determined that he is a third-generation descendant. Doubting my words is the same as doubting the patriarch and head elders!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This time no one dared to talk back, and Pei Ze nodded his head in approval. &quot;Pei Yue is a member of our family now. He has the rank of a member of the younger generation, but he is still a descendant of the third generation. Treat him with respect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The last words were said to remind these experts that Hui Yue and they were not in the same league, but Pei Ze was also aware that strength was what mattered in this world. Without strength one was nothing. They needed to see Hui Yue&apos;s strength to truly respect him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze said nothing to all those people who were mumbling to each other, complaining about the sudden appearance of Hui Yue. They all felt that they had been mistreated in some way. All of them knew that outsiders were to be killed, but Hui Yue had been allowed to become one of the inner sect disciples, and even worse, maintain his rank as a third-generation descendant!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You there!&quot; Someone finally stepped forward incapable of containing his anger and disdain for Hui Yue, and he said with a high-pitched voice, &quot;You cannot think that I will respect you just because your bloodline is purer than mine! Your father or mother broke sect rules and had a bastard like you! That is what you are, a bastard! You should be put down like the bastard you are! You are just a new God, and we have to respect you? Keep dreaming!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing deeply, Hui Yue looked at the angry expert. He was clearly not a new God, and he had quite a bit more Ancestral Worldpower than Hui Yue had. He was born as a God and had matured over the last hundred years where Hui Yue had not even been a God for a decade.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In that case why don&apos;t you guide me?&quot; Hui Yue asked casually as he waved his hand at the expert. The casual way Hui Yue looked stunned the older cultivator quite a bit, but right now Hui Yue had the full support of the black figure, and he was not going to hold back.</p><p dir="ltr">The black figure was apparently not unreasonable. As if he knew that Hui Yue winning these battles would give Huli more peace in the future, so, therefore, he lent his strength to Hui Yue. Even though Hui Yue got his help, he could clearly feel that this was solely because of Huli.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The person he was up against had a belly full of anger. He felt that Hui Yue was purposely looking down on him, but just as Hui Yue was about to use the dao of space, a voice drifted into his ears.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You have a much purer bloodline than them, using your wings to suppress them is the best solution so that you don&#x2019;t have to display any of your daos. Also having them thinking that your only benefit is a strong bloodline will help you in later battles where you can display the other tricks up your sleeve.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clearly Pei Ze that spoke to Hui Yue, and the young man smiled slightly. If he could avoid using the black figure&apos;s energy he definitely would. Although the energy was incredibly strong, it was not very easy to control, and he never knew exactly when he would be able to fully control it and when he could not.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">So changing his original plan, he did not reach out his hand to lock space, but instead, he summoned his wings. He felt how they unfolded on his back and filled the entire area with a warm, gentle light.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, when Hui Yue used his wings, he did not feel anything special as they were just wings on his back, but this time, he felt a domineering aura surge from the wings and weighed down heavily on all the experts present. His wings alone were enough to heavily pressure the younger generation, and all of them were forced a few steps backwards. Even Pei Ze was incapable of completely ignoring this pressure.</p><p dir="ltr">Snorting Hui Yue looked at all those he had pushed back and sent his consciousness into the wings on his back. His facial expression changed as he realized that there were many different ways to use the bloodline of the great roc, however, he was still quite unclear what bloodline techniques he could use. He needed to merge with his past life to be able to fully understand the secrets hidden in the great roc&apos;s bloodline. The great roc was definitely a divine beast at the same level as the four divine beasts he had met in the Divine Beast World.</p><p dir="ltr">Quickly leaving the wings, Hui Yue observed what was happening around him, and he could not help but smile slightly. The many experts from before were all huddled together in a big group far away from Hui Yue, and the only one who had been able to somewhat withstand the overwhelming pressure was Pei Ze. Seeing that it was also troubling him, Hui Yue quickly dispersed his wings.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Cracking his neck, Hui Yue looked at the group of experts, &quot;When you are able to compete with this aura then I will gladly fight you.&quot; Hui Yue said casually and was about to turn to leave when he felt a fist hit his back, breaking one of his ribs.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue felt how all the organs in his body shook and blood welled up in his throat only to be swallowed down again. Turning around Hui Yue saw that one of the experts who had previously been huddling together with the others had a sinister expression on his face. His hand was covered with Ancestral Worldpower, and he was using some sort of dao that Hui Yue had not comprehended.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at this expert, Hui Yue&apos;s eyes suddenly turned cold. He sneered at this expert as he was about to attack, but before he had the chance to act Huli turned into a streak of light and transformed into her black nine-tailed fox form.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Her claws came swiping down from above, and the chest of the young man was sliced open by five sharp claws. His body slammed heavily into the ground causing cracks to radiate outwards from where he had collided with the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Huli, come back,&quot; Hui Yue said with a calm voice, and Huli, who had been about to kill the expert, instantly transformed into a blur. Back in her human form, she stood next to Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue used the lifeforce in his body to quickly heal the wound he had received and went towards the man who had attacked him.</p><p dir="ltr">Using his foot to turn him around he saw that he was still breathing and squatting down placing a hand on the bone-deep cuts lacerating his chest.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire area had turned silent; no one knew what Hui Yue planned to do when he touched the wound, but all of them were shocked speechless when they saw a green light appeared around Hui Yue&apos;s hand. A light that slowly but surely started to close up the wounds on the chest of the fallen expert.</p><p dir="ltr">The man was still unconscious, but the wounds were all completely healed after fifteen minutes time, and Hui Yue, scanning him with his soulforce, nodded his head. He had indeed succeeded in saving the young man&apos;s life.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You know a great dao within the dao of life to heal people?&quot; Pei Ze asked curiously, but Hui Yue just shook his head, &quot;No, it&#x2019;s lifeforce.&quot; He said, &quot;I can harvest and store lifeforce within my body which I can use whenever necessary.&quot;&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
