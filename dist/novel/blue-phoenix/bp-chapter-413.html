Not only would the explosions shake the surroundings, but they also ended up wounding Hui Yue. They would set him back making him waste time.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While it was true the more he refined, the more essence of the heavens and the earth he would absorb, but he was eager to let Lao and Jo reach the King rank.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was responsible for these two children and now that Sha Yun had been taken away from him, he knew that for the children&#x2019;s safety he needed them to gain strength.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As seven hours passed, a sigh escaped Hui Yue&apos;s lips. He looked at the two golden pills in his hands and satisfaction washed over him as his body suddenly leaned back against his bed, no longer taut and fully focused. He was now exhausted to the extreme.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Entering the Universe Box, Hui Yue looked for the white-robed expert and the expert appeared almost instantly. Since their conversations always consisted of trades the white-robed man was in no way too proud to come running.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I have to warn you.&quot; He said even before Hui Yue spoke. &quot;Although I can help you find things here, there is a limit to the items in this endless space. Although you have been lucky so far, I have to tell you that many of the treasures here are not of any use to you. Since you can forge weapons from precious materials, the weapons in here are of no use to you. All you will be able to do with them is trade them to others. You already have all the books about inscriptions, the majority of the formulas and the majority of the ores and herbs. I have some techniques left but teaching you more techniques seems wasteful. Considering this, what is it that you could possibly want from me?&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">The white-robed spirit was completely honest when he spoke, and he looked straight at Hui Yue, but his words did not frighten the young man. He knew he had already benefitted tremendously from his visit to the grave, and at some point, he would reach the point where he could no longer get wonderful items from the Universe Box.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I did not come here for things today.&quot; He said with a smile on his face and with a flick of his hand twenty storage stones appeared by his side.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I want to hear a story. A story about the world where Silvermoon&apos;s Pill comes from.&quot; He continued, causing the white-robed spirit to look puzzled.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Sure, I&apos;ll tell you about it.&quot; He said reaching out. He grasped all the storage stones with one hand, and they then vanished. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You already know about Crowned Sovereigns and the ranking of the ten thousand strongest worlds. This world, although a part of the ten thousand worlds, is one of the lowest ranked worlds. It is only ranked so highly because of its strong density of essence present.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The top thousand worlds are known as the heavenly realms. These heavenly realms are very strong. The essence of the heavens and the earth they possess is many times stronger than here, and they are worlds where everything is more powerful as well. For them to begin cultivation, they are not considered cultivators until they unlock their upper dantians, and therefore they created a pill to let them jump straight to the rank equivalent to the King rank in this world. In the heavenly realms, Saints are as numerous as the clouds in the skies, and even Gods are rather common. If you become a God and start traveling the worlds, you will no longer be like a frog in a well; the world will expand before you, and you will learn how amazing many of the other worlds are.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was shocked. Worlds where one was not considered a cultivator until they reached the King rank. That was intimidating.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you senior, I might return to get some more information later.&quot; He said with a bow, but the white-robed spirit just waved his hand before he vanished into thin air.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Opening his eyes once more, he cuddled with Huli for some time after which he left the room. Lao was not present, but Jo was training together with Wag Ju Long. Both of them were meditating and absorbing the energy from the heavens and the earth. Looking at the two girls, Hui Yue&apos;s heart felt warm, but it quickly froze as he thought about Sha Yun once again. He owed her a lot, and he would do anything to save her, even if it meant spending all his time practicing alchemy.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Go to the Royal Academy and pick up Lao. Tell him that I need him back here as soon as possible.&quot; Hui Yue ordered a maid he stopped in the hallway. The woman instantly curtseyed before she left the mansion, rushing towards the Royal Academy.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as Lao was informed that Hui Yue was looking for him, he dropped everything he was doing and rushed back to the mansion. He even left behind the maid who was unable to keep up with his pace. He was after all already a genius cultivator.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Reaching the mansion he slowed down, straightened his clothes, and caught his breath before entering the front door. Entering through the door, he stopped a maid and asked, &quot;where is my master?&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The Lord is in the library.&quot; The maid said while curtseying. After hearing, Lao turned around to leave. His heart was filled with dread and anticipation. He was partly worried that he had done something wrong and the other half of him hoped that he was going to be praised by this magnificent master.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Although Lao wished to rush towards the library, he calmed himself down and moved slowly towards the library. He did not want to seem too eager as it would embarrass him. After having joined the Royal Academy, he understood that his cultivation level was incredibly profound; everyone at the academy looked at him as if he were a monster.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As a genius, there were certain things he needed to do, and one of them was to be calm and collected. He was expected to be smarter than any of his friends; he was supposed to be perfect.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Anyone who looked at Lao would consider him perfect, and he could not help but hope that his master, Hui Yue, also felt that he was worth supporting. He would do anything to make Hui Yue proud.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While Lao was thinking about all these things, he reached the library. Lifting his hand, it hesitated slightly before he knocked on the door. His heart was beating rapidly, and the second it took for Hui Yue to respond seemed like an eternity for the young boy.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Come in.&quot; A gentle voice finally sounded, but although it was gentle, it caused Lao to feel as if the pressure of a mountain was weighing on him. He was willing to do anything for the sake of Hui Yue, but because the older man always spent his time cultivating, crafting, or traveling Lao had not truly gotten to know him. He still feared that he would be kicked out of the family and left behind. He had to be the perfect cultivator because of Hui Yue. Had it not been for the white-haired young man taking him in, then Lao would have never known that he enjoyed cultivating.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Moving into the room, he saw Hui Yue seated behind a desk. Three books were placed on the table in front of him. Although one could use memory stones to leave behind information and techniques, it was not possible for them to contain as much information as one could put into a book. Although books were very rare, nowadays most noble and influential families had some.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;How do you find the academy?&quot; Hui Yue asked Lao with a gentle smile on his face, and the young man&apos;s heart skipped a beat. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;It is good. I learned quite a few abilities and techniques there. Although they cannot compare to the ones you have gifted me, they are not bad.&quot; He answered straightforwardly, and Hui Yue nodded his head before he became quiet. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The quiet atmosphere did not last long as after a few minutes Wang Ju Long and Jo entered through the door. Both looked somewhat surprised.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;What is so important that you had stop our cultivation, not to mention bringing Lao all the way home from the academy?&quot; Wang Ju Long was truly surprised with what Hui Yue had done. Acting rash was not something he usually did.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Without answering Hui Yue picked up two jade bottles and placed them on the desk. Both were sealed with blood at the top. This was a sealing method which required of the cultivator to infuse their blood into wax. This made it impossible to open it without the owner&apos;s permission. </span></p><br><p><span style="">If one were to forcefully break open the bottle, then it would instead shatter, destroying the content inside. Blood seals were indeed rather strong and often used by alchemists. </span></p><br><p><span style="">If alchemists did not use blood seals, then they would be easy targets for others. They were not used to battles as most of their time was spent concocting pills, but their pills were all protected by blood seals, and therefore no one would gain much from killing them. Even in death, the blood seal would stay intact. </span></p><br><p><span style="">This blood seal was one ability which Hui Yue had purchased at the Alchemist Guild for the price of five Devouring Red Orchid Pastes. The price had seemed low, but the ability was quite widespread so even if they wished to ask for a higher price they would not get it.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Lao, Jo, and Wang Ju Long were all patiently waiting for Hui Yue to start speaking. Their entire focus was on the two bottles, and they were quite confused.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Cutting his finger, Hui Yue dropped some blood on each of the seals, and they slowly corroded away, allowing for an intense medicinal aroma to spread throughout the room. It was so thick their breathing almost became labored.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;What is this?&quot; Wang Ju Long was the first to get over the shock of the heavy odor, and she looked at Hui Yue with big eyes. She was clearly unable to determine what exactly could be inside these bottles.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Lao, Jo, reach out your hands, I have something for you.&quot; Hui Yue said, and without questioning anything two small hands reached forward.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Taking one bottle first, Hui Yue reached out for Lao&apos;s hand and turned the bottle upside down. A small golden pill rolled out and landed on the small hand; beautiful pill lines were reflected in the light.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Everyone within the room was quiet as Hui Yue repeated the action over Jo&apos;s hand, both children now held these valuable pills.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;What... What is this?&quot; Wang Ju Long asked with big eyes and a trembling voice. She had never heard about such a seemingly amazing medicinal pill before, and she could not comprehend how a pill could have such amazing heavy air around it.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;This is a pill formula I gained from the grave. The pill is called Silvermoon&apos;s Pill, and it is a pill which allows for the consumer to reach the King rank, instantly.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The owner of the tomb came from a heavenly realm. In these heavenly realms, cultivation does not start until you unlock your upper dantian, and thus they made pills like these to give to the younger generation so that they could become Gods quicker.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;These pills makes sure that your foundation is as stable and reliable as can be, and then they unlock your upper dantian. I know that you are incredibly skilled Lao, and I know that you will soon become a King on your own; however, accept this pill from me. I believe you can become the youngest Saint in the entire history of this plane.&quot;</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
