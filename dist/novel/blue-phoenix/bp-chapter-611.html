Only Hui Yue was capable of causing such a ruckus from a single fight.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Why do they even make challenges like these?&quot; Wei suddenly asked confused. It did not make much sense that they had such missions free to choose, was it not just giving free contribution points to the stronger members of the sect?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is exactly as you think,&quot; Hui Yue laughed as he saw the confusion on Wei&apos;s face. &quot;The stronger one is, the more one needs contribution points. However, it is not viable to leave the sect for a long time for missions. Also if every sect member left the sect for missions, the inner sect would no longer be safe as all the high ranked members would be out doing missions. Not to mention that there is likely not enough missions for everyone.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Because of this, the sect is giving the higher ranked members a chance to get their hands on some contribution points every week by challenging an Immortal of Creation.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see,&quot; Wei did not seem convinced by the fact that the members of the sect were gifted contribution points, but he did not mind it very much. Sect matters were for Hui Yue to deal with.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;How are you doing?&quot; Hui Yue asked, but Wei just shook his head and sighed. &quot;I am doing great. I have a lifestyle where I barely need to do anything for anyone. Until you become an Immortal of Creation and we leave this sect my life will be very free. I can do anything I want in the city.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue laughed as well, the two of them looked at one another, both pretty happy with how their lives were right now.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;When we leave the sect I will be bringing a rather large group of experts with me,&quot; Hui Yue finally said after a bit of time, and Wei nodded his head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Before leaving, Yanluo told me that you have some treasure on you which allows for you to carry some friends with you. How many people are with you right now?&quot; he asked, and Hui Yue was surprised that Yanluo had said as much.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have eleven Gods ranked experts,&quot; he said after counting for some time. &quot;There are ten beasts, nine of whom have been together for four thousand years and Huli who has been by my side for a long time.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Apart from these ten beasts, there is a human friend of mine, Cai Jie.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Apart from these, where some are Immortals of Creation and others are Primordial Immortals, I also have mortal friends who will be traveling with us,&quot; Hui Yue continued and raised his hand as he started to count.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have quite a lot of people who will be joining us. I have quite a few friends who are trying to &#xA0;break into the God rank right now.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Wei frowned for some time and looked at Hui Yue as if he were a little confused. &quot;Although they are trying to become God ranked experts, they are currently not strong enough to travel with us... What is your plan for them?&quot; &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue contemplated for some time, and then he understood that Wei was correct. His friends needed to become stronger if they wanted to survive in the vast galaxy.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Contemplating for some time, Wei finally decided on what to do, &quot;You could use your power as an inner sect member to have your friends enter the guardian sects. When they enter the guardian sects, they will have to fight hard for resources, but their strength will advance many times faster than it is now while they are in your spatial treasure.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue heard this and nodded his head. It made sense. Having his friends join a sect was indeed the best option right now, and with Hui Yue&apos;s protection, they would have decent lives.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Wait a second,&quot; he said. Moments after he vanished from the room, shocking Wei quite badly. It did not take long before Hui Yue returned, but now he was not alone, by his side were eleven God ranked cultivators.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Huli&apos;s aura was sharp and gave Wei a feeling of fear when he looked at her. A similar, but much weaker, feeling was also felt from the one Hui Yue introduced as Cai Jie.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The other Gods did not seem too threatening. There was no harsh aura&#x2019;s coming from them, no menacing air or intimidating expressions on their faces. If anything, they looked slightly stumped and surprised as they looked around the room.</p><p dir="ltr">As Wei sought them out, he noticed that of these eleven Gods, six were already Immortals of Creation. The first two needed no explanation, but as for when and how the other four had managed to become Immortals of Creation, Hui Yue truly had no idea.</p><p dir="ltr">If Wei had known that they only knew one dao each, he would have been incapable of holding back his laughter. Although it was possible for experts to reach the Immortal of Creation rank by only following one dao, it was simply so rare it was considered impossible. The reason for this was because everyone that cultivated focused on seeking the dao as it was ultimately what proved one&#x2019;s strength and what determined one&apos;s ability to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Okay.&quot; Hui Yue spoke up, and everyone quieted down. They all sat down in the incredibly crowded room. While most were busy looking at Hui Yue, Xiao She, the snake-woman, started eating the food that was placed in the middle of the table, not caring about anything else.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this, Hui Yue had a wry smile on his face. This woman was truly hard to control, but considering that she was Lan Feng&apos;s beloved, he knew that she would be hard to deal with. Just look at how outrageous Lan Feng was! If his woman was not as difficult as him, then something was wrong.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue shook his head and ignored her before he looked at the Gods again. &quot;I called you all out because I want you to join one of the guardian sects of my Celestial Sword Sect,&quot; he explained.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I think now there is no reason for everyone to stay within the Divine Beast World and do nothing. It&#x2019;s time to step foot into the galaxy and start standing on a bigger stage! You all will need to improve at a rapid pace and to do so we are going to change your environment.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue smiled, he was very excited. He wished to bring Huli with him to the inner sect already but to do that he had to marry her. Although Hui Yue knew that one day they would marry, now was not the time. He refused to marry anyone as long as Wang Ju Long was in such a state.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, he waved his hand. A leather bag appeared in his hands which he threw to her. &quot;Here are one million Worldpower Stones for each of you,&quot; he explained as he threw a bag to each of the other Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t expect that I can keep giving you Worldpower Stones,&quot; he warned them. &quot;But this should be enough to allow you to increase your cultivation and build a foundation.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Then he waved his hand, and a pill shot out and flew to everyone except Huli. &quot;This is a Pill of Clarity. Eat it when you are comprehending an important dao, and it will help you with your comprehension.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">After giving them the Worldpower Stones and the pill, he did not give them anything else. &quot;Follow me to the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s main office within this City of Endless Clouds,&quot; he said as he stood up. The food on the table had been cleaned completely by Xiao She, and there was no reason for them to stay at the restaurant any longer.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they left the room, the waiter who had been tending to them was staring at the entourage with wide eyes full of shock. He could swear that only two had entered, but now thirteen left. How was such a thing even possible?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue took a small bag of Worldpower Stones and placed it in the hands of the waiter after which he placed a finger on his lips and winked at the waiter. Although this person had originally wanted to tell his boss about the sudden influx of experts, he instantly changed his mind. He had been gifted a very heavy bag of stones, which could easily be over two hundred Worldpower Stones. This was simply meat pies falling from the skies for a mere waiter like him. If he could curry favor with this expert, then that would be for the best.</p><p dir="ltr">The group left the restaurant and headed towards the massive pagoda that towered high above every other building in the City of Endless Clouds. No matter where one was within the city, this pagoda would be visible in the sky above. It had become the landmark of this city. Many came from far away to see this pagoda, and many had the dream of one day standing at the top and looking out at the city that spread out below it. Rumor had it that one could see to the end of the Celestial Sword World from the top. However, Hui Yue doubted that this was true.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they reached the tower, Hui Yue stepped in front of the others as a group of guards blocked the way.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;No entrance for outside members,&quot; they said sternly, but Hui Yue flashed the emblem from the inner sect, and the guards instantly became many times more polite. These guards were not inner sect guards but from one of the many guardian sects. Thus they venerated inner sect members.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Young Master, you can enter, however, your companions have to stay outside,&quot; the guards said politely, and Hui Yue just shrugged his shoulders.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Huli, Wei, Jie, look after the others and make sure no one starts trouble. I&apos;ll be back soon,&quot; he said as his eyes landed on Xiao She. For some reason, he had a premonition that they might have trouble doing as he said.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking his head, he told himself that it would be fine, and Hui Yue hurried into the massive pagoda in front of them. The sooner he entered, the sooner he could finish his business and come out.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The pagoda was large. It was truly a massive building with many rooms on each floor, and the first floor was no exception.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue entered, he saw that on the right was a desk with a young woman seated behind it. The moment she saw Hui Yue her eyes sparked to life, and she sat up straight.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Welcome young master,&quot; she said politely. Her voice was very gentle and filled with curiosity, &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; she asked.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have eleven experts I want to join the guardian sects,&quot; Hui Yue said straightforwardly. He honestly had no idea who to ask about such a request and the woman just nodded her head in understanding.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Eleven experts, ok. I will find the forms, and then we will go outside and have them join the sects. Since you are a member of the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s inner sect, you are allowed to add anyone you wish to the guardian sects.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see,&quot; Hui Yue sighed with relief as he knew that as the years went by more and more people would be joining him in the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s World and by extension joining the guardian sects as well.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Time would make his group much stronger, all they needed was time to develop.</p><br></div><p></p>
