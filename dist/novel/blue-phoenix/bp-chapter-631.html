They were like demons, a race created to serve powerful Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">The God who created the valkyries was named Odin, and he had used them as his sword maids but as time passed the valkyrie race flourished on its own.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Valkyries were a strange race. They could mate with both beasts and humans, but their children would all be female and would always be full-blooded valkyries. As for how Odin managed to create them, no one knew, and since Odin had vanished eons ago, no one could ask him.</p><p dir="ltr">Valkyries were very shy of other races. They lived in worlds such as the Heavenly Dragon Gate&#x2019;s World that were filled with desolate snow-covered fields. Where others would be unable to live an easy life, these valkyries found peace.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas the descendants of the Celestial Sword Sect had a strong affinity with the wind, the valkyries had a strong affinity with the snow. So of course they preferred to be in snow covered areas.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Valkyries were not an easy target for anyone; most people preferred to stay away from them because of their skillful use of swords and that they always took advantage of the snow surrounding them to boost their power. This formation, although not containing a real valkyrie, had the same traits as one. It truly was a deadly formation.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Be proud that you have forced me to use this formation! I will prove to you what it means to be a true genius!&quot; Gao Li sneered at Hui Yue his face already smiling because he was assured of his victory, but Hui Yue was not ready to give up just yet.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;So you have an ultimate formation,&quot; he mumbled to himself more than anyone else. &quot;But who says that I don&apos;t have one too?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate formations of the Celestial Sword Sect all had wind as their fundamental element, but Hui Yue had picked another formation to be his strongest.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He instantly stopped all the formations that he had created previously except for his Spacelock that was about to be unleashed.</p><p dir="ltr">Right after stopping his other formations, the Spacelock exploded forth supported with as much power as it could borrow from the dao of space and firmly locked Gao Li in place.</p><p dir="ltr">Gao Li could not open his mouth and speak, but his eyes showed disdain as he looked at Hui Yue. It was clear that he thought that this battle was over as soon as he managed to get out of this formation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue instantly summoned forth three hundred seals and started to arrange them in an orderly fashion. It was clear that he was creating a three hundred seal formation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue continued to weave the seals through one another and pour his soulforce into the seals. He was getting low on soulforce now, but he knew that by now Gao Li should also not have much energy left. If he could make this formation work, then there was a chance of defeating this genius, but if he couldn&apos;t then, he would be the one defeated.</p><p dir="ltr">His creation of the formation was flawless. The speed he used to create this three hundred seal formation was so fast and smooth that many people who watched it were in awe with how simple he made it seem.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">No one knew that he had practiced this so many times, that he had formed it time after time to perfect his control over the formation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue urged his soulforce into the seals and just as the formation roared and completed, Gao Li was freed, and the valkyrie swept down from the sky above.</p><p dir="ltr">No one had seen what it was that was hiding underneath the many seals that Hui Yue had summoned, but they all suddenly felt an increase in temperature. This increase was not similar to when he created the Blazing Tigers. No, this felt like a sun descending upon the stage, and the heat was almost unimaginable.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously when the valkyrie arrived no such occurrence had appeared but now that Hui Yue summoned forth a formation, it was suddenly overwhelming everyone. Was this truly just a three hundred seal formation?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This formation... It can&#x2019;t be?&quot; The weasel from the Heavenly Dragon Gate was stumped for words when he felt the rise in temperature and was completely gobsmacked.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Bai on the side was smiling widely. He knew exactly which formation this was, and it was not a formation he had found for Hui Yue, it was a formation the young man had managed to find on his own. As for where it had come from, only Huli and Hui Yue knew.</p><p dir="ltr">The truth was that he had traded a lot of storage treasures with the Universe Box for this formation, and the formation was the most outstanding fire formation that the Universe Box had.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Rumor had it that originally this galaxy had ten suns, all of who were brothers. These ten brothers were all controlled by the Jade Emperor, an Overlord that came after Pangu. They would shine upon the galaxy one at a time. Every morning one sun would travel across the galaxy and shine it&#x2019;s light onto the worlds beneath.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, these suns were all young and filled with mischievousness and loved to fool around, so one day, they all appeared in the sky together.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">But, the moment these suns appeared in the sky together, the temperature in the entire galaxy rose drastically. Worlds started to wither and burn, and it was simply impossible for anything to grow.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These suns were unaware of the consequences of their actions, and they kept playing, even when asked to stop their misdeeds by many experts. The mother of the suns, Goddess Xihe, asked Houyi to get the suns to behave, yet once again they did not listen. As a result Houyi appeared in front of them and shot down nine of the ten suns with his terrifying arrows. Afterwards Houyi was viewed as a hero, and he managed to save all races from damnation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These ten suns were exactly the same suns as the formation was created after. The formation was known as the Ten Suns formation. It was not like most formations, and it was very difficult to learn. It was a multi-level formation!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When one had one hundred seals, it was possible to create one sun. With two hundred seals one could create two suns, and so on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had three hundred and nineteen seals and thus was able to form three suns. When he reached the Grandmaster rank, he would be able to form an entire ten suns. At that time, he would be almost impossible to defeat.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although these formations were outstanding, and they became more and more powerful the more suns he could create, the thing which made them so shockingly powerful was not just their initial strength but also the four daos of fire that Lan Feng had comprehended and the dao of inferno that Hui Yue had comprehended.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">With five fire daos, the strength of the Ten Sun formation was simply too overwhelming.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The valkyrie screamed out when she got too close to the three suns that soon displayed themselves on the stage. All three were different sizes, the next always bigger than the previous ones.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I heard about this formation in the past,&quot; the old weasel said slightly smiling. He truly was shocked to the core; he had never expected that such a killing technique would appear on stage, it truly was no shame to lose to this youngster.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;When he has managed to control the full formation then he should be able to learn the Goddess Xihe formation.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If he can do both the Ten Suns and the Goddess Xihe formations, he should be able to enter the Valley of Light in the East. I heard it is filled with treasures beyond belief. It is an archaic world that has been around since the time when the galaxy was first created!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I heard it is the dream location for anyone who is searching for ancestral treasures, herbs, ores, anything! To become such an astonishing expert, the Celestial Sword Sect truly has benefitted this time!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Bai said nothing although the Weasel was standing right next to him, he just smiled. He too felt excited about the prospects of Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">While the two old men were talking, the fight raged on stage. Although the valkyrie was greatly disadvantaged, Gao Li was not willing to give up, and he gave all he had to display his superiority. He made it snow in the hope that the snow would cool down the suns or extinguish them, but as soon as it came close to the three suns that were crowded around Hui Yue all the snow melted and the water instantly evaporated.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Tell me, since he understands this formation does he also have access to other primordial formations that should have been long since extinct from our galaxy?&quot; the old weasel almost did not dare ask this question. He understood that the Celestial Sword Sect was not going to share it, but he needed to know if their spot as the number one Formation Master&apos;s sect was going to be snatched away by the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I honestly do not know,&quot; Pei Bai answered truthfully. &quot;But if I did, I could not tell you where we got it from nor could I tell you whether or not we have more than the one.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Bai just smiled as he said this but he also had a slight headache. Hui Yue had given him the formation to learn and practice, but he had still not managed to form more than four suns. He understood that he was many times slower than Hui Yue when it came to formations and that his talent was only mediocre compared to Hui Yue&apos;s.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had continuously protected himself with the three stars, never once launching an attack at Gao Li, and finally, the match ended as the genius no longer had any soulforce. His valkyrie formation slowly turned into mist before dissipating into thin air.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I... I lost?&quot; Gao Li&apos;s voice was filled with disbelief as he spoke, and everyone was shocked. He was the number one genius of the younger generation when it came to formations. He was a proud son of the heavens yet now he had been beaten.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The one who beat him was someone he had looked down upon. Someone he had insulted, and he had said that his person had no talent for formations, yet when the truth came out, he was indeed more talented and more outstanding than himself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The winner is Pei Yue!,&quot; was something everyone knew, so when the Weasel announced it, no one was shocked. In the end, the one they had all looked down upon was the winner. The one they had all thought was only here to not lose too much face was the highest ranked in the Formation Master&apos;s debate.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Soon the top ten had been decided. The winner got a huge amount of resources and formations that had been pooled together by all participating sects, and Hui Yue was the happy recipient of all these cultivation resources.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Bai, who had already thought it impossible for Hui Yue to win was simply ecstatic. He was so thrilled that he did not know what leg to stand on, and his face was flushed with excitement. Even if he did not do great in the older generation&apos;s Formation Master&apos;s debate, Hui Yue had already gained face for the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the day went with everyone discussing the benefits they had gained by watching others and stronger experts&#x2019; debates.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although they had not ranked, they had gained enlightenment and were all feeling extra motivated for continuing their path down the road of formations. They were all certain that formations were the best cultivation method for them, whether it was the Flight of the Valkyrie or the Ten Suns formation both were so magnificent and brilliant that it instantly blinded everyone present. The potential of the first and the second ranked experts at the debate was simply too shocking!</p><br></div><p></p>
