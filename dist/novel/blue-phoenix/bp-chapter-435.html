The slash cut through the air at the advancing expert. Lifting his sword he tried to block the sword energy from Hui Yue, but the sword in his hand trembled before it exploded into thousands of pieces of metal. This weapon was clearly not of superior quality. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The debris from the sword landed on the advancing experts causing superficial wounds. Although the wounds were nothing to these experts, they felt insulted that they were the first to shed blood immediately after the battle begin and the attack they had faced was nothing more than a shockwave of sword energy. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Xiao Ning dealt with seven Saints on his own. Although he was at a disadvantage, pushing his shields to their limits, he ensured that no one was able to wound him. While defending against so many though, he was completely unable to attack the Saints surrounding him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Ye Ling, Zhu Jun, and Luo Qiang were busy dealing with another five experts. Thanks to Hui Yue&apos;s care and training neither of these three Saints were weak anymore and fighting five Saints proved to be not too difficult a task.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The three Saints fighting Hui Yue were bursting with anger as they sped forward heading for the young man who had already wounded them slightly. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Bring it on!&quot; Hui Yue yelled, and suddenly his body started changing. His skin changed to red fur, his body swelled, and his eyes grew red. The appearance of the young man changed completely to that of a wolf standing up on its hind legs as its muscles bulging under his skin shocked everyone. Powerful shockwaves radiated outwards from him, and the pressure he now emitted was so strong that everyone was forced backwards.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The world turned silent. This was a battle watched by many from the shadows, but they were not the only people who stilled with shock from Hui Yue&#x2019;s transformation. Most of his friends and allies grew astonished as well, hope and pride were evident in their eyes. The enemies, however, had looks of despair. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Everyone knew that Hui Yue was the Grand Marshall of the Shenyuan Beast Army and that he should have some beastly heritage to him. Naturally, that would mean he would be able to transform, but ever since he had arrived in Muchuan City years before he had never taken his beastly form before. None of his new friends had ever seen it before, and now that he was in his beast form everyone felt a terrifyingly strong pressure weighing down upon them as those red eyes calmly observed what was happening around him. Even in the Grave of the Unknown had he avoided use the beast form; however, now things were different.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Fifteen Saints! This was an astonishing number to fight even for Hui Yue, and he had to end this quickly before one of them decided to stoop so low as to attack his King ranked experts.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Jumping from the flying sword he landed on the roof of a building and with an explosive step, Hui Yue pounced at the Saints who had gone to attack him moments before and with his speed enhanced as much as it was, he reached them in a blink. Looking at the roof he had stomped upon the top had carved in, and the sheer power of the current Hui Yue made the hearts of everyone close by numb. He could not even be compared to his previous self.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Reaching the first three experts, Hui Yue had a toothy grin on his face; his killing intent was boiling, and his desire to kill had been ignited. Right in front of him was the first expert, and just as Wu Wei was pooling in front of him, taking the shape of a massive hand, Hui Yue&apos;s sharp claws came down from above. They shredded both the Wu Wei in front of the expert and the chest of the Saint who had tried to attack. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking at Hui Yue with disbelief, the expert plummeted to the ground; his eyes turning dim as his life left him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The moment he died, Hui Yue felt a strong force of energy enter his body. This energy was the lifeforce that the Saint had left. Sensing the strength enter his body, he understood that he had gained almost a hundred years. The Saint&#x2019;s lifeforce invigorated his body making him younger, stronger, and even more powerful than before.</span></p><br><p><span style="">This explosive power was needed as he swiftly dodged to the side as another Wu Wei attack raining down upon him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Everyone gather back up!&quot; One of the masked men called out, and every Saint backed up, gathering together in a large group. A group which now consisted of fourteen men instead of fifteen. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The Emperors tried to follow suit, but since there were five Emperors on both sides, no side had the advantage and retreating was no easy task as Lao displayed his Wu Wei attacks, Deng Wu&apos;s soul shadows were flickering back and forth, launching sneak attacks and keeping the opponents in place. Xu Piao also utilized his abilities to their limits. His favored attack, the Wu Wei palm was constantly flying around, slapping one expert after another causing the opponents to be on guard or they would be seriously wounded.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Wang Ju Long was not participating at the front lines, but plants sprouted here and there catching the opponents and making it impossible for them to flee, advance, or in any way move. Their attacks were disarrayed every time they were stunned by the plants.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Sha Yun was fighting completely differently than Wang Ju Long; she did not stay at the back but instead was in front. Her tail was like a whip and her hands constantly manipulating the ground. She had been given the skill Earth Tremor by Hui Yue, and the ground was constantly transforming. Spikes appeared randomly and hands shot up from the ground grasping at experts or swatting at them.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was standing on the roof of a building, looking at the group of Saints who had gathered once more. His eyes were narrowed, and the red flame within kept burning. Being in his wolf form did not cause him use up energy, so he was in no rush to attack. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The other group was the same. Although they had taken Hui Yue&apos;s snowstorm prison into account, they did not expect that he had an even more powerful card up his sleeve. See this they had to reconsider their chance of defeating him. Behind Hui Yue, Xiao Ning and the trio were standing ready to fight at a moment&apos;s notice. They had Hui Yue&#x2019;s back and made it even more difficult for the masked group of experts to attack.</span></p><br><p><span style="">It was clear that they were contemplating and suddenly the group of fourteen Saints attacked all at once. Wu Wei shone all around as their attacks were not focused on one specific person but aimed at everyone, including the Kings.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Xiao Ning, protect the others!&quot; Hui Yue hurriedly called out, and although the older man moved as swiftly as he could, the Wu Wei attacks quickly arrived in front of the King ranked experts., No matter what they were about to do, they knew they could not avoid them in time. Their faces turned ashen, and they were filled with fear.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Xiao Ning&apos;s shields arrived in front of the Kings, but Jo was still at the corner, and his shield was not large enough to protect her. Her face was filled with fear, and just as she was about to back up, a shadow appeared in front of her. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue had moved as swiftly as he could and used his own body to block the attack. The attack slammed him into the ground creating a two-meter deep crater. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Cracking his neck, Hui Yue stood up and dusted the dirt off his fur before a black sword appeared under his feet and he swiftly flew to the sky.</span></p><br><p><span style="">His body was bleeding from many wounds he sustained, but his wounds heal almost instantly thanks to the lifeforce he had gained earlier, and with his red fur, the blood could not be seen either.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Having witnessed Hui Yue slammed into the ground after taking on so many attacks with just his body and still being able to stand up like nothing had happened with no apparent damage, the hearts of the masked experts grew cold. </span></p><br><p><span style="">If their direct attacks were this useless, what chance did they have of defeating him?</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Retreat!&quot; One of the masked men called out, and just as he did the others nodded their heads, taking to the skies. Many of them used flying swords to try and scatter, but laughter rang throughout the skies.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You tried to kill me, that I can accept. You tried to kill my friends, that I cannot tolerate, but worst of all, you tried to kill my child! For that, I will never let you live! Hear my words, if I do not kill you today, then I will definitely hunt you down and kill all of you! We cannot coexist! Do not believe that your silly masks will save you! I want you all dead!&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">His voice could be heard throughout the entire city, and even the experts who were just observing felt his killing intent in every word, which caused them to shudder. They knew that this was no joke, and Hui Yue&apos;s words were serious. The moment he finished speaking his flying sword accelerated so much that he turned into a blur; a blur which landed right next to the first fleeing expert. With a growl, Hui Yue stabbed the expert with Icy Tempest, and with a swipe of his hand, he picked up the flying sword and the many storage stones on the body of the expert. A body which then plummeted to the ground.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as Hui Yue finished dealing with the first expert, his sword turned him to a blur once more as he reached the second expert. Here he used his hand to crack the neck of the expert once more taking his items before the body landed on the ground.</span></p><br><p><span style="">That day was known as the day of death. One expert after another fell dead from the sky and in total nine experts lost their lives that day. Some had been killed by a sword strike, and others were killed by his savage claws. Some had their necks crushed while others had been decapitated. The same person killed every Saint, and that was, Hui Yue. Because of this day, his name spread throughout the city even faster than it had been before. Some compared him to the King of Hell while others defended his actions. </span></p><br><p><span style="">It was so bad that Hui Yue was summoned by the royal family&#x2019;s first and second prince as the dead experts had been their supporters. Though after getting witness accounts from both citizens and cultivators alike saying that it was the masked experts who had challenged Hui Yue, no one could do anything against him. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Of the fifteen Saints, nine had died, and only six remained alive. Although these six were the strongest of the group, their hearts were filled with fear as they remembered how close to death they had been. They had seriously underestimated Hui Yue.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;But Father!&quot; Young master Shao called out as he looked at his father, the Patriarch of the Shao family. &quot;We cannot just give up like that. He killed too many Saints! How could the royal family let him go? How can we let him go!? We need to get revenge!&quot; Young master Shao still remembered the time at the inn where he had been shame by Hui Yue. He would never be at peace until &#xA0;Hui Yue was dead!</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
