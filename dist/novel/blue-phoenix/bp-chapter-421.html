While walking down the road of a major marketplace, Hui Yue could not help but notice what was happening around him. Many experts were moving aside and making space for Hui Yue and his family as they walked forward. </span></p><br><p><span style="">At the markets, many mercenaries were selling beast cores and herbs that they had gained in the last few months. From time to time, Hui Yue would purchase some of the items. The higher rank he became as an alchemist, the more beast cores he would need as ingredients for his pills. Although he had obtained many cores from his time within the Dungeons of the Divine, Hui Yue had not been killing many beasts as of late.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Moving through the marketplace, they soon reached the end. Looking outside, Hui Yue saw that there were multiple restaurants and entertainment houses present. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Why don&apos;t we go eat at one of the restaurants together?&quot; Hui Yue asked with a smile. Today was a great day; he had allowed himself to relax, and although he had not forgotten Sha Yun and her situation, he decided that he could have one day of relief.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You have to take us to a great restaurant!&quot; Jo said, her eyes shining and Hui Yue swore that he could see her salivating. Looking at her Lao felt that she was a little too bold. He feared that Hui Yue would scold her but instead the white-haired young man gave a hearty laugh and patted her affectionately on the head. &quot;Of course, it will be a proper meal. You will be able to eat as much as you want, and if you behave you can try tasting some wine too.&quot; He laughed. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Although Jo and Lao were children, they were King ranked experts. Normal wine could no longer get them drunk only immortal wine was capable of this, and immortal wine was not something one could purchase in shops.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Jo, since you want to eat a lot of food, why don&apos;t you decide where we should eat?&quot; Hui Yue asked smiling brightly. For him it did not matter where they ate, he just wished to experience the feeling of being with his family one more. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Can I really decide?&quot; Jo asked with big eyes as her voice trembled slightly. Hui Yue nodded his head. Everyone looked at Jo, and it was clear she had something in mind.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;When it was just Lao and me there was this restaurant I would often walk by. The scent of the food was intoxicating. When I was hungry, I always went there, but the servants would shoo me away. I used to dream about going inside every time I passed by, but knowing our situation how could I ever tell big brother about my wish?&quot; Jo&apos;s face was filled with emotion as she remembered the many times she had walked past the restaurant. Although she was much more intelligent now, her wish to one day eat at the restaurant was still there, and now that she was allowed to choose, she wanted to eat at that place.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;In that case, lead the way,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile on his face. Allowing for Jo to have a dream come true, how could Hui Yue not grant her simple wish? </span></p><br><p><span style="">It was not only Jo who was ecstatic, Lao was just as excited, but as he was older, it was embarrassing to show this excitement. Still, his steps were swift, and his face had a large smile which he could not suppress. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The small family of four made their way through the busy streets heading towards the restaurant which Jo had dreamt about so many times.</span></p><br><p><span style="">After walking through half the town, Jo finally came to a standstill. In front of her was a bustling restaurant filled to the brim with people. A delicious scent of food wafted out from within. Hui Yue could imagine how the younger Jo would have felt walking past this busy place.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Jo, who had been at the front, no longer wished to walk in first, so she hid behind Hui Yue, holding Wang Ju Long&apos;s hand. Her behavior was understandable because the only real interaction she had with this place was being shooed away. Although she knew things were different now, those emotions could not be changed. Even Lao was somewhat apprehensive and took Wang Ju Long&apos;s other hand.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The woman looked at the two children and felt her heart turn soft. With a gaze at Hui Yue, she conveyed her intention. He was to move first, and the three would follow behind him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Feeling slightly helpless Hui Yue shook his head before he moved towards the entrance. Two guards were blocking the way but upon closer inspection of Hui Yue and his family they respectfully bowed and opened the doors.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Entering inside was like going into another world. The light was dimmed, and many booths were already filled with parties. Some were mercenaries celebrating the sales they had had that day while others were merchants celebrating the same. There were also alchemists celebrating as well. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Clattering sounds could be heard as glasses were used to toast and cutlery clanged on the plates. Loud voices were chatting and laughing, the mood within the restaurant was filled with excitement. Only a very small group of people noticed Hui Yue and his family&apos;s entrance, and they quickly lost interest in them.</span></p><br><p><span style="">A servant rushed towards them, &quot;Milords, what can I do for you?&quot; He asked with a deep bow and his hands clasped together. His eyes quickly scanned over the entire group, and his heart shook when he noticed the two children. Although they were holding their mother&apos;s hand like good children both of them had an aura which was much stronger than his own. It was so strong that he was incapable of even guessing their strength. He was a Grandmaster ranked cultivator and to see children so much stronger than him, his heart could not help but quiver.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Do you have a private booth?&quot; Hui Yue asked as he looked around the noisy restaurant floor &quot;A place where we can have some peace and quiet? I will pay extra of course.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Yes, yes. We have VIP rooms.&quot; The servant said while turning around as he led the group of four to the very back of the restaurant and up a set of stairs. </span></p><br><p><span style="">On the second level, there were many rooms which were blocked from one another with heavy blankets and curtains. This ensured that the sounds from within the rooms were muffled. Only two of the five curtain and blanket covered rooms were occupied, the others were free.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The servant lead the four experts into one of these private booths. Three walls were covered with curtains and blankets that had beautiful embroideries on them. They were of various magical beasts, while the last stone wall had two large french doors leading out to a small balcony. One could choose to open the door and get some fresh air into the room.</span></p><br><p><span style="">In the middle of the room was a round table and on the ground were pillows scattered all around. Clearly, these pillows were suited for someone to sit on.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Please make yourself comfortable. If you need to summon this lowly one for ordering food and drinks feel free to use the memory stone in the middle of the table. Sending a message into this stone will instantly send a message to me.&quot; He explained. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue and the family sat down around the table, and the servant left a card in front of each guest. A card which explained the food and drinks they sold. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing the guest focused on the menus, the servant bowed deeply and left the room. He ensured that the curtains were drawn so that no one would be able to hear what was said within. Although no one could hear exactly what was said, indistinct sounds could be heard from the neighboring room and from time to time laughter could also be heard as well.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;So Jo, now we are here, what would you like to order?&quot; Hui Yue asked gently, but Jo&apos;s eyes were wide, and her face was filled with uncertainty. &quot;I don&apos;t know...&quot; She said helplessly as she looked at the menu. &quot;Everything looks so good I really cannot choose!&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I have to admit that I have a hard time choosing as well.&quot; Wang Ju Long laughed as she looked at the same menu, completely uncertain about what to choose. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Well let&#x2019;s do it like this then.&quot; Hui Yue said as he summoned the waiter. It only took a mere moment, and he appeared in front of Hui Yue and his family.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; He asked very politely, inwardly quite surprised that they had already summoned him. Usually, it would take quite some time to decide what to eat, yet this family had made a quick decision.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;We will take one of each dish on the menu.&quot; Hui Yue said with a nod of his head, and the waiter felt his own eyes go wide. &quot;You want to have one of each dish?&quot; He repeated stunned, but when he saw Hui Yue nodding his head, he was elated. One who wished to order one of each dish had to be very rich. This meant that there was a chance of him getting a very good tip if he did his job well. He bowed deeply and was about to leave before he turned around once more. &quot;Milords, for your drinks what would you prefer?&quot; He asked politely. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;All of us would like to have some wine. I will let you chose the best of the ones you have to offer,&quot; Hui Yue said casually. Although the servant was elated, he started to wonder if Hui Yue truly had as much money as he was pretending to have. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing the hesitation in the waiter&#x2019;s eyes, Hui Yue withdrew three spirit coins and tossed them to him. &quot;Here you go; this should be enough to pay for the entire meal and the drinks. You can keep the rest.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing the three spirit coins, the mouth of the waiter went dry. One and a half was sufficient to pay for everything and even leave a nice tip, but three spirit coins were more than he had gotten over the past year.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Bowing even deeper, the waiter could not help but say &quot;thank you,&quot; with a trembling voice. He instantly rushed downstairs to find his boss, and when the boss saw the three spirit coins, he too felt his mouth go dry. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;These guests, treat them well.&quot; The boss said as he held the shoulders of the waiter with a firm grip. &quot;If they can become regulars then I will make you the headwaiter!&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing this promise, the servant was willing to do anything to make them enjoy the visit so much so that they would come back. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Boss, I am going to take the peach wine.&quot; He said seriously, and the boss nodded his head. &quot;Take it. Let them drink as much as they want to drink and let them have a party here all night. Even if they stay after the restaurant is closed, let them. We are here to entertain, and the money they paid is really extravagant!&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">The waiter could only agree as he nodded and rushed to the wine cellar where he picked up two old bottles of wine. Both of them were from a group of only twenty bottles, yet these bottles were still taken out. The servant lifted the bottles and headed towards the stairs leading to the second floor. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Milord, please enjoy this peach wine. It is a specialty our restaurant has made. There is a very limited supply, but I am sure that you will enjoy it!&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Having said this, the servant poured the wine into a glass, and Hui Yue tasted it. The moment the wine entered his mouth a pleasantly surprised expression appeared on his face, and he nodded his head. &quot;This is some very good wine.&quot; He complimented, and the servant felt as though a stone had been lifted from his shoulders.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Pouring the wine to each of the guests the servant bowed once again. &quot;I will return shortly with your meals.&quot; He said humbly before he vanished behind the heavily embroidered curtains.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
