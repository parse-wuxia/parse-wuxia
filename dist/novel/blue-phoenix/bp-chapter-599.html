Young experts would run towards her with jade boxes, jade vials, and various containers holding items and herbs along with a slip of paper which would have a name written on it.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Yin,&quot; the woman called out, and a woman called Pei Yin stepped forward and accepted a pill with reverence.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking around Hui Yue found that there was also another line of experts waiting to talk with the young man at a counter as well. All of these experts had two bags in their hands, and scanning them with his soulforce, Hui Yue could tell that one contained herbs and materials while the other contained Worldpower Stones.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Focusing on hearing, Hui Yue eavesdropped on what they were talking about at the counter. &quot;I have four sets of materials and two thousand Worldpower Stones. I wish to hire an alchemist to concoct the Myriad of Daos pill.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue scoured his memories and found the pill recipe in question. It was a fairly simple pill which allowed for a person to come into contact with and feel the daos in the world around them. Usually, it was used when one had just comprehended a full dao, and they wanted to start on their next dao.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was a pill that Hui Yue had complete confidence he could concoct, but it seemed that they required this person to hand over four full sets of materials alongside Worldpower Stones. It seemed that the alchemists in his sect were beyond rich!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that these alchemists were in control of quite a lot of power and were looked at with veneration but even so Hui Yue threw away any idea he had of joining them.</p><p dir="ltr">They were so busy concocting pills and perfecting their pill formulas that they would be incapable of spending much time comprehending the dao or cultivating. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, the alchemists were amazing at what they specialized in, and compared to mortals they were far too strong, but compared to the majority of other Gods, they were simply too weak.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was curious about joining the Alchemist Palace with the hope of getting his hands on more formulas, but after thinking it through, he shook his head and turned to leave.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As he left, everyone within the hall, who had pretended not to see him, suddenly turned silent and watched him leave with mixed emotions. Some looked at him with curiosity while others looked at him with hostility. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had noticed this change, but he did not mind it too much. He quickly exited the building before moving towards the next location that would catch his attention.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He found that there was a dining hall within the inner sect, but everyone who wanted to eat had to pay with either contribution points or Worldpower Stones. Since food was not needed to live, it was just a luxury, and so one had to pay for it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not eager to eat and quickly passed the dining hall. Then he found a small shop that specialized in herbs; a place where herbs were being traded for Worldpower Stones or contribution points. This was a place Hui Yue had a great interest in. Although he had been given a mountain of herbs by Yanluo, he could not help but feel that he might be in need of extra herbs.</p><p dir="ltr">The herb shop was very similar to the Alchemist Palace, yet quite a bit smaller. In the entrance hall, there were multiple books where one could flip through, find the herb they needed, and walk towards one of the five counters to place an order.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue found that the entrance hall was smaller than the hall within the Alchemist Palace, but it was just as crowded. He waited in line for his turn to go through one of the books and look at what kind of herbs were available. He was astonished as he saw that every kind of herb was present, albeit some of them had an exorbitant price.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue spent some time going through the book, but he did not find any herbs that he could use. He already had all the herbs that he needed for the time being, and he gave the book to the next one in line before turning and leaving. Once more his departure was filled with glances and mixed emotions.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After visiting the herb shop, he stopped at the armory, the weaponsmith, and the treasury. Everywhere he went he would look at the things that were for sale, but nothing caught his eye and made him want to spend Worldpower Stones. Although there were some tempting things, they were not items that he felt an urgent need to own. The prices the sellers wanted in Worldpower Stones were all rather high, but it seemed that if one used contribution points they were more reasonably priced. Unfortunately, Hui Yue still had absolutely no contribution points.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he had achieved the unthinkable by becoming the Second Judge of Hell, the patriarch understood quite well that if he gave Hui Yue a lot of contribution points, then the other members of the sect would definitely be insulted by it. In the end, it would do him no good.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even Hui Yue knew this, and it was why he did not mind much. Although he wished to have contribution points, he did not want to provoke others&#x2019; ire that badly. He could always work hard and get his own contribution points later.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, he did not enter the contribution point hall; the place where everyone with contribution points could go and check how many points they had.</p><p dir="ltr">He did, however, go towards the administrative building that dealt with everything that had to do with the sect and its members.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The administrative building was not big, but there were a lot of people entering. Mainly these people were here to announce the birth of new members of the sect, or get information about family members out on missions.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There were also young members of the sect who came to announce that they were now old enough to be considered cultivators or even that they no longer belonged in the younger generation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue went straight for the counter this time, and when the person behind the counter saw him, he was shocked. He was completely stunned at first but then the reason for why Hui Yue was there dawned upon him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are here to sign up as a member of the Celestial Sword Sect I assume?&quot; he asked timidly, and Hui Yue nodded.</p><p dir="ltr">Both looked at one another for a moment not completely sure how they were supposed to go about this, and finally, Hui Yue sighed. He did not fully understand how they did things here, so it was not his place to come up with solutions.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ugh, this is not going to be easy,&quot; the man behind the counter mumbled to himself before he turned to leave. &quot;Stay here,&quot; he ordered as he started walking away. &quot;I will get an elder who will be able to help set up your papers.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Just like that, he dashed away, but while he ran, Hui Yue became the center of attention for everyone within the building. No one tried to mask that they were curious about him and were sizing him up. Seeing this, Hui Yue could do nothing but ignore them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue stayed in place for only a few moments before an elder came rushing towards him with an apologetic smile on his face. The moment Hui Yue saw him, he understood that this elder was one of those who had a favorable opinion of Hui Yue and he was relieved. It would have been annoying if there was an elder trying to make problems for him already.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will do it like this; first we will pretend that he is a newborn. Fill in the papers as you would when someone comes to announce the birth of a new member of the sect,&quot; the elder ordered, and the man who had notified him nodded his head and scrambled to find the papers.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Full name?&quot; He requested, and Hui Yue answered straight away, &quot;Pei Yue.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Father?&quot; He continued, and Hui Yue answered, &quot;Pei Tian.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Generation?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Third Generation.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When he wrote third generation down his hand trembled slightly. It was shocking to even see someone of the third generation, and to deal with such a sect member face-to-face was simply unthinkable.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Mother?&quot; he asked, and Hui Yue hesitated for some time. &quot;Do I need to answer that question?&quot; Hui Yue asked tentatively. He was not willing to leave any clues to finding his other parents. If someone disliked Hui Yue, then they would take out their hate on his parents, and this was something he could not accept.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Usually, we need the name of the mother, but in this case, we will make an exception. We will write Unknown instead,&quot; he ordered, and the man behind the counter quickly did as he was told.</p><p dir="ltr">Then came many questions about the appearance of Hui Yue. His eye color, his hair color, and his skin color.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Okay, then on to the next part,&quot; the elder said as he found another stack of papers which they needed to fill in. These were the papers showing that Hui Yue was now a member of the younger generation of cultivators; that he was no longer a child.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The papers asked questions such as which dao did he first gain insights into, and what his talents were and so on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It took Hui Yue a full three hours to fill out all paperwork, and when he finally left the building, he had his hands on an emblem with his new name and some basic information about him. This emblem would need to be updated from time to time when he became a higher ranked member of the sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The contribution points were also stored within this emblem, and if one were to use the points to purchase something, then they needed to display their emblem.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having sorted the issues at hand, Hui Yue ended up aimlessly wandering about the sect. He looked at one building after another, and he looked at everything from Ancestral Worldpower Skills to the training fields.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Wherever Hui Yue moved, people would stop and stare at him. Many were curious about what kind of person he was, and it was not before now that Hui Yue noticed that the main emotion they felt towards him was curiosity, not hostility. Although there was some with jealousy in their eyes, it was far from everyone.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue continued to walk past the many training experts as he watched people who were sparring or training on their own. He enjoyed the friendly atmosphere that was filled with voices, yells, and other sounds coming from the training experts from when their attacks hit their targets.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Walking around, Hui Yue saw a dummy which no one was using, and with a casual slash of his hand, using the dao of gale around him, he formed a wind blade which instantly sliced it in half.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The attack was effortless and everyone who watched it narrowed their eyes. One had to know that these dummies were rather sturdy and only an Immortal of Creation was capable of breaking them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This young man, who was only fifty years old, was capable of destroying it with utter ease.</p><p dir="ltr">They were unaware of what kind of attack he had used, but if they knew which dao he used with his hand, they would have been able to understand the attack better.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was a third generation descendant of the great roc, a beast which had an innate connection with the wind. Hui Yue integrated the insights he had gained while fully comprehending the dao of the gale into his simple attack causing its power to skyrocket. His attack was in no way inferior to an Immortal of Creation attack. &#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
