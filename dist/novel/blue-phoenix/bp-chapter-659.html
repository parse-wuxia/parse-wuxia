It really did become insanely difficult to sense the dao!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed as he was seated in meditation. He tried to connect with the dao of wind, yet all he could feel surrounding him was the dao of earth and the dao of fire.</p><p>It was clear that it was not possible for him to continue with the speed he had from before as he closed off all his senses of everything else. His entire focus was on sensing the weak dao of wind which was around him.</p><p>It was as if he was swimming in a sea and everywhere he looked he could see drops of the dao, but these daos were the daos he had already comprehended.</p><p>Persevering through this, Hui Yue finally sensed a slight trace of the dao of wind, and he held on to it for dear life. His entire consciousness focused on this one strand of the dao that he had found and he dedicated his entire mind to comprehending its mysteries.</p><p>He was in a deep trance and noticed nothing about what was happening around him. He did not notice how days went by in a flash while his mind was focused on the dao.</p><p>Everyone on the ship was busy cultivating or keeping an eye on their surroundings, and no one wished to interrupt Hui Yue. Everyone understood that he was meditating and if he were interrupted now, everything he had worked so hard for would be gone. It would slip through his fingers like water.</p><p>Even Lan Feng, who was usually rather talkative was completely quiet while Hui Yue was comprehending the dao of wind.</p><p>So far Hui Yue had not yet comprehended a major dao on his own. The first had almost been forced onto him by merging with his memories of the red gem. It had happened so fast that he had been unable to truly grasp the true way one comprehended a major dao, and when the dao of fire was comprehended, it was Lan Feng who had experienced it.</p><p>Now that Hui Yue was trying to comprehend the major dao of wind, he could feel how every minor dao of wind was pressing on his mind. They were merging together one after another, and the energy he could control was growing by the minute.</p><p>This was the minor dao of wind he needed to comprehend, and when he had fully grasped it, he would be able to use the major dao.</p><p>It was like thousands of small streams came together and created a sea. They rushed into Hui Yue&apos;s body, baptizing it with energy and he felt how the wind became a part of him.</p><p>A part of him would forever belong to the element of wind. He would be able to use it as easily as he could use his right arm, and when he closed his eyes, all that he could feel was how the wind surrounded him, together with the earth and fire. These three elements were second nature to him. They were so natural and overflowed everywhere he went.</p><p>Curious as he was, Hui Yue could not help but wonder how hard it would be to sense any more daos, yet no matter how hard he tried, everything around him was solely the wind, earth, and fire. No matter how hard he tried, he found that it was impossible for him to sense anything else.</p><p>&apos;You tested it too?&apos; Lan Feng asked with a sigh. &apos;You have been cultivating for nine days straight to get this last bit of the dao of wind comprehended, and during this time I decided to try and see if it was possible to sense any other dao,&apos;</p><p>Lan Feng sighed and shook his head.</p><p>&apos;Before you managed to comprehend the dao of wind I spent a whole day to sense the minor dao of teleportation. It was going very slowly, but I did manage to gain some initial insights into it, but when you broke through the connection I had with the dao of teleportation instantly shattered, and all my progress went down the drain.&apos;</p><p>Lan Feng was clearly unhappy with this result. &apos;Although we now control three major daos, that cannot be the limit for us. We need to be able to comprehend all of the major daos. We need to be invincible!&apos; he said with a fevered gaze in his eyes, yet Hui Yue just chuckled.</p><p>&quot;Comprehending all the major daos? I think that is an impossibility. But we are still young, and we have already comprehended many daos so there is plenty of time to worry about them in the future. The Pills of Clarity are completely useless to us now, and our only option is to take the Pill of Samsara if we wish to suddenly boost our strength. But doing so will limit our future potential so it would be like shooting ourselves in the foot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since we can no longer rely on pills, our only option is to rely on the strength we have already gained. When we have managed to get you your own body and resurrected Wang Ju Long, then we can enter secluded meditation and focus on the next dao. Right now we should be strong enough to deal with most of the dangers that we would encounter within the Archaic World.&quot;</p><p>Lan Feng nodded his head. &apos;We will need to be strong if we wish to fight An He,&quot; he said seriously. &quot;An He has given up his humanity to advance in the dao and his potential. He will become a dreadful enemy in the future, and if we wish to beat him, we need to be stronger than him and more ruthless than him.&apos;</p><p>Just as Hui Yue was about to answer, he heard Huli&apos;s voice from outside the cabin.</p><p>&quot;Bandit attack!&quot;</p><p>Had Hui Yue still been in meditation then he would have never heard her voice. This was because she was not using any Ancestral Worldpower to strengthen it, and, now that he was not fully focused, he was aware of what was happening around him.</p><p>Instead of feeling panicked, a smile appeared on Hui Yue&apos;s face. He flicked his hand causing the Sword of the Icy Tempest to appear within his palm.</p><p>With a swing of his arm, he felt how the air rumbled as space itself was sliced apart by his casual strike.</p><p>His Ancestral Worldpower pool had more than doubled from what it was before he had comprehended the dao of wind. Now, as he attacked he also felt the elements surrounding him, and his casual sword strike contained a tremendous pressure caused by the three daos he had comprehended.</p><p>It was not possible to merge the different major daos, but it was possible to stack them.</p><p>Opening the door, Hui Yue slowly went forward towards the upper deck where he could hear the fighting that had broken out.</p><p>As he reached the deck, Hui Yue looked around with a smile still present on his face. Huli, Cai Jie, and Pei Ziqi were fighting the stronger members of the bandit force while the beast Gods and his friends and family were fighting the weaker people. Wei was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x2019;s go,&quot; Hui Yue grinned, and with a tap of his foot on the floor, he shot forward as fast as the wind. No one could see him as he moved faster than anyone present thought possible. Almost instantly, he arrived behind an Immortal of Creation.</p><p>With a casual flick of his sword, he beheaded the expert. Hui Yue did not even blink as he killed this bandit, and he did not slow down either. The moment he had finished his attack he had already flown towards his next target, who also lost his head in a similarly stunning fashion.</p><p>At first, none of the bandits really paid attention to Hui Yue, but after killing two experts within moments and seeing that these experts were incapable of even fighting back, everyone felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>&quot;Yue!&quot; &quot;Father!&quot; &quot;Brother!&quot; as soon as they noticed that Hui Yue had participated in the fight, they all called out in excitement. All of them felt astonished as they saw how easily he killed two Immortals of Creation.</p><p>&quot;Since you are here already then there is no rush to leave,&quot; Hui Yue laughed as he saw that a few of the bandits edged away from the ship. With another tap on the ground, he shot towards the fleeing bandits.</p><p>Heads flew left and right as Hui Yue dove into the middle of the bandit group. He was laughing like a maniac as the wind danced around him and he swung his sword time and time again.</p><p>With every single flash of the sword, a bandit would lose his life and blood would splatter. With every swing of his sword, a corpse would collapse on the deck.</p><p>It did not take long before the entire air of the shuttle was filled with the scent of blood. The air was a little red as a blood mist was present in the area wherever Hui Yue went through.</p><p>Hui Yue killed the vast majority of the bandits, while his friends all killed their own target and then stopped fighting. It was clear that Hui Yue was testing his new strength, so killing more of the bandits would just be inconvenient for Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;I surrender!&quot; someone called out, but Hui Yue just laughed. &quot;Sorry, I do not accept anyone surrendering today!&quot;</p><p>It was not that Hui Yue was ruthless always, but these experts were bandits. They lived off of killing people every single day, and the amount of blood they had spilled could rival that of Hui Yue. If they had been stronger, not only Hui Yue but all his friends would have become subject to their mercy. It was clear that they would have been killed and their corpses dumped in the vast void.</p><p>&apos;They deserve it,&apos; Lan Feng said with a snort, and suddenly flames appeared on Hui Yue&apos;s hand and corpse after corpse burned to a crisp. They turned to dust which slowly spread with a wind which came out of nowhere.</p><p>Everyone stared at Hui Yue with a fevered gaze. Their eyes were filled with respect, and it was clear that they respected him more than anyone else.</p><p>&quot;That was amazing!&quot; Hui Lei said with excitement in his voice. His eyes sparkled, and he was the first to speak his mind. Although Hui Yue had always been strong, this was the first time they ever saw him engage in a one-sided massacre like this after becoming a God. Not only that, but the ones he killed were Immortals of Creation!</p><p>&quot;You are a little monster,&quot; Pei Ziqi chuckled when she looked at Hui Yue. She remembered how he had been a new God when she had first met him in Youdu not even a century earlier, and now he was so overwhelmingly powerful that not even she dared attack him without proper preparation. Seeing this sudden change in him made her understand what a real genius was.</p><p>&quot;One day you will help make the Celestial Sword Sect the top ranked sect of the galaxy, everyone will respect us, and everyone will know your name. With such a talent there is no way you will be an unknown person in the future,&quot; Pei Ziqi speculated while laughing, but Hui Yue just shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>&quot;The most important part is to constantly become stronger. I need to be strong enough to protect everyone dear to me,&quot; he said honestly, not caring at all about the fame that he might be able to earn. For him, his family and friends were much more important than whatever fame his sudden rise in strength brought him.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
