In his previous life, he had been with quite a few women, and although that was quite some time ago, he was not interested in women other than Wang Ju Long and Sha Yun. Still, he would be lying if he said he was not tempted by this fox-woman who was moving closer and closer to him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Huli?&quot; He asked with a voice full of doubt as he looked at the woman in front of him. Hearing Hui Yue&apos;s voice, a sweet smile appeared on Huli&apos;s face. She moved swiftly towards him and seated herself on his lap, nestling up against his chest as she used to do when she was a fox.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Uhm, excuse me?&quot; Hui Yue was startled by the sudden movements of the fox, but even more uncertain of what to do. This was Huli, someone he felt he had an intimate relationship with, but realizing that he had been snuggling up to a sexy woman like this time and time again, he felt a little drained of energy.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master, you don&#x2019;t like me?&quot; Huli asked with big eyes as tears were welling up within. Her finger clutched his shirt, and she started shaking him back and forth as she cried. &quot;Master I worked hard to get my human shape back, don&apos;t hate me!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As she spoke, she snuggled closer to him, wrapping her legs around his waist. Now she was sitting right on top of him. &quot;Master, I will do anything for you; don&apos;t throw me away.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing the panic in her voice, Hui Yue could do nothing but sigh.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;First, get down from my lap.&quot; He said as he stroked his forehead. He could feel a headache coming on, and even worse, he could feel that his body was starting to react to the constant friction caused by the fox that would not sit still in his lap.</p><p dir="ltr">Expecting the fox to do what she was told, Hui Yue waited for some time, but she did not show any signs of moving. When Hui Yue tried to stand up making her fall to the ground, she just exerted some strength and made it impossible for him to move. She was clearly much stronger than him!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Please get off!&quot; He pleaded as he was starting to feel rather panicked, but then a cheeky expression appeared on Huli&apos;s face. She shook her beautiful head and said with a clear voice, &quot;I don&apos;t want to.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was feeling mentally exhausted and started thinking about what Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long would think if they were to see him in a situation like this, and he quickly managed to calm himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the man beneath her, calming himself, Huli felt rather depressed. She pressed her body even closer to Hui Yue, placing her head at the nape of his neck and intentionally breathing onto his bare skin.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If you don&apos;t stop I won&apos;t forgive you.&quot; Hui Yue said seriously, and this finally caused Huli to stop. With a glance to check whether or not he was serious, she sighed and moments after transformed back into the shape of a small black fox.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Without any hesitation, she placed herself right on Hui Yue&apos;s lap and snuggled up. Wrapping herself into a ball, she fell asleep.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Staring at the cute fox, Hui Yue was at a loss for words. He felt that he had been violated and at the same time his mind was completely unable to comprehend just how strong this small fox was.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking his head, Hui Yue moved towards the bed in the room and placed the fox on the blankets instead of having it in his lap. He then sat down on the hard stone floor and started cultivating. He would not have been able to calm his mind and enter meditation with the fox on his lap while thinking about just how attractive she truly was. She truly did live up to being a fox.</p><p dir="ltr">The night went by without any more trouble, but when Hui Yue awoke from his cultivation, he once more found the sexy woman attached to his body. This time she was seated next to him with her arms wrapped around his arm and her breasts pressed against him. Her eyes were closed, and a happy expression could be seen on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">Before Hui Yue had the chance to open his mouth and tell her to let go, the door opened, and Deng Wu came in. &quot;Yue, listen to this! The banquet today is...&quot; Before Deng Wu managed to say more, he was completely shocked and just stood there with his mouth open and his eyes wide.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This&#x2026; This... Who is she?&quot; He asked stunned. Hui Yue was no playboy; he would not suddenly fall for a woman just because of her appearance, and this woman was clinging to him as though they had known each other for years. Was it perhaps a secret childhood sweetheart he had reconnected with?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue sighed and stood up, but even his movements did not cause the fox-woman to let go of him. Instead, she kept holding on and rose to her feet too. Her head was leaning on Hui Yue&apos;s shoulder, and a satisfied smile was on her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Wu, say hello to Huli.&quot; He said exhausted as he walked out the room. Deng Wu on one side and Huli attached to his other.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;So Huli is such an attractive woman, huh?&quot; Deng Wu asked curiously as he could not help but stare at the woman in front of him. He was not as good at controlling his emotions, and thus he felt quite a lot of lust after looking at her. She was simply too attractive, and by then, Hui Yue had guessed it had something to do with the way she cultivated. Like a fox, she was getting more and more seductive the stronger she became.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;How are you going to explain this to Ju Long and Yun?&quot; Deng Wu asked curiously while laughing; he could already imagine the drama that would occur when they noticed that Hui Yue was so close to another woman.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What can I do?&quot; Hui Yue asked with helplessness in his voice. &quot;She is my beast companion, and I cannot just release her. I bet that she would not let me even if I could.&quot; Hui Yue said, and his voice had a tinge of hopelessness within it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was running out of ideas. Although he felt friendship towards Huli, he felt nothing else, yet the woman kept going with her advances. Although she did not interrupt him when he was cultivating, she refused to be away from him. Although she was very clingy, even as a fox, Hui Yue did not expect her to be just as clingy, if not more, in her human form.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are her master, just order her to stop.&quot; Deng Wu said exasperated, but Hui Yue shook his head. &quot;I already tried.&quot; He said.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Use force against her then! If she cannot understand something as simple as an order, then you need to be more rough with her that might be the only thing she understands!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;She is stronger than me.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Deng Wu and Hui Yue both turned quiet, and a bitter smile emerged on Hui Yue&apos;s lips. Huli was by his side, snuggling up to him and completely ignoring their conversation. She was acting as if it had nothing to do with her. She was not even annoyed; she just showed an expression of utter bliss.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It could be worse.&quot; Deng Wu tried to console Hui Yue. &quot;Although Yun is likely to flay you alive, I am sure Ju Long will listen to you and hear your excuses at least. As for whether or not they will forgive you, I cannot say. I mean if I were a woman and my man was being violated by such a big breasted and attractive woman I would be very unhappy.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You aren&apos;t helping.&quot; Hui Yue sighed. As they walked through the mansion, everyone stared at them. Some looked shocked at the display of affection; others were mesmerized by the beauty of Huli, while yet others looked at Hui Yue with reverence in their eyes. This was the hero who had changed their lives!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Who is that?!&quot; The bull appeared out of nowhere, and behind him one God after another showed up. Unlike the mortals, their eyes were filled with vigilance. Their bodies exploded forth with Ancestral Worldpower causing the ground to tremble and large cracks to appear on the floor. Although they had not launched any attacks yet, the air was dense with Ancestral Worldpower causing everything to shake violently. Seeing this, Hui Yue frowned.</p><p dir="ltr">With but a glance at these gods, Huli removed her arm from Hui Yue&apos;s and casually waved it in front of her. All the Ancestral Worldpower from these experts instantly dissipated into thin air.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master doesn&apos;t want you to break his family&#x2019;s home.&quot; Huli said with a dissatisfied voice and a pout on her face before she once more entangled her arms around Hui Yue, snuggling up to him once more. &quot;I was a good girl, right?&quot; She asked with bright eyes and a happy smile.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking his head, Hui Yue did not know what to say or do. &quot;This is my magical beast companion Huli.&quot; Hui Yue finally sighed to the Gods, and all of them were filled with trepidation. Their combined amount of Ancestral Worldpower should be enough to deal with almost any God they came across, yet this woman had dissipated it all with but a wave of her hand. Her strength was so high that it left them terrified. Why on earth would she choose to enslave herself to someone as weak as Hui Yue?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Huli followed me when I was still an Emperor.&quot; Hui Yue explained as he saw the disbelief in the God&apos;s eyes. &quot;She tends to leave and return at random times, so I never thought too much of her not being in that fiery realm with us. I guess you were never introduced to her.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That is Huli?&quot; A frosty voice suddenly sounded through the corridor, and Hui Yue felt his heart skip a beat. He turned around and looked at a murderous Sha Yun who was anything but happy.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Transform! Prove that you are not just some leaching little girl who wants to take advantage of our Yue!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The woman in the black furred dress just looked at Sha Yun before she shook her head and stuck out her tongue. &quot;No way! Don&apos;t want to.&quot; She said; the same words she had spoken to Hui Yue earlier, and it was clear that she wasn&#x2019;t going to change her opinion.</p><p dir="ltr">Sha Yun&apos;s face turned red. She was about to explode when Hui Yue went to her and kissed on her forehead. &quot;It is Huli. I am sure she&apos;ll become less clingy with time.&quot; He said gently, and Sha Yun&apos;s anger completely dissipated with the kiss. She obediently nodded her head, and her cheeks flushed red. Although she was quite brazen, she was also embarrassed to be kissed in front of so many people.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Me too, me too!&quot; Huli said pointing to her forehead, but instead of kissing it, Hui Yue lifted his hand and flicked his finger. &quot;Ouch!&quot; Huli cried out as tears welled up in her eyes, but she did not cry nor did she release Hui Yue. Instead, she just held on even more firmly than before.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is going to be troublesome.&quot; Hui Yue sighed trying to release his arm, yet his every move was completely pointless. He had no way of making Huli release him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is?&quot; Wang Ju Long&apos;s voice sounded through the corridor. Her voice was not hostile but confused, and Hui Yue looked at her with depressed eyes. &quot;She is Huli.&quot; He sighed, and instead of getting mad, Wang Ju Long just nodded her head. In her heart, she had complete faith in Hui Yue, and she knew that he would never do anything that would intentionally hurt them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Morning, son! Oh! A third wife!&quot; Suddenly, Hui Guang&apos;s voice sounded through the hallway, and while Hui Yue felt like hitting something, Huli&apos;s face turned bright. A great smile appeared on her lips as she repeatedly nodded her head.</p><br></div><p></p>
