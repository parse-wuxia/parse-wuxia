Even though he was experienced and strong, his chances of winning were looking quite grim. He was likely to receive some wounds.</p><p>Hui Yue considered hiding within the Universe Box as well, but he feared that if he did so then, the Blood Demons would just stay and wait until he reemerged. Then he would be even less prepared than he was now as he would be slightly disorientated whenever he left the Universe Box.</p><p>Since this was the case, Hui Yue decided not to enter; instead, he steeled himself. His eyes focused on the demon lord who held the World Ending Bead in his hand and he reached deep within himself. He knew that his soul was stronger than other souls because he had merged with the blue monk, the red wolf, the green witch, the celestial wings, the mountain, and the black figure.</p><p>But there was one more past life he could reach out to, that was the shining star. This star had some obscure daos that Hui Yue could vaguely sense, but he could not sense exactly which they were.</p><p>As he was currently facing a suicidal Blood Demon, he wrapped his body in layers upon layers of daos. Not only did he wrap the major daos around his body, but he also started to wrap every minor dao he had comprehended around himself.</p><p>Hui Yue revolved his Ancestral Worldpower within his body, and a layer of protection appeared in front of his body.</p><p>During this whole time, only a second or two had passed. While Hui Yue was layering daos around himself, he had been retreating as well.</p><p>As the lord watched, the maddening expression on his face had twisted into a grin. This grin was filled with insanity. He knew that his life was at its end, but he did not even tell his comrades to retreat.</p><p>By now only a moment had gone by since Hui Yue had taken away Lan Feng, Wei, and Pei Ziqi into his Universe Box. No one had noticed what this demon lord was planning, and he was not going to tell them either. To this demon lord, his allies being sacrificed with him was normal. He was their leader; if he were going to die, then they too would perish.</p><p>Hui Yue had guessed that this demon lord was planning on sacrificing all his companions as he did not for even a second consider warning them. The fewer Blood Demons, the better, and if a million of them could be wiped out from this World Ending Bead, then he felt that it was worth risking his life for such a chance.</p><p>Hui Yue grit his teeth. He constantly flashed backward astonishingly fast, but at the same time, he saw that the demon lord was not attempting to chase him. It was clear that he expected his World Ending Bead to cause a massive explosion capable of killing Hui Yue even if he fled hundreds of kilometers away.</p><p>They were fighting in the middle of the void. There were no worlds near them, and no one came here by mistake. The only reason that Hui Yue and his friends were here was because they had been tracking and hunting down the Blood Demons. Even if space itself were damaged, no one would notice.</p><p>This was of great benefit to Hui Yue. If he managed to survive this, he had no doubt that he would be seriously injured. In that case, he would definitely benefit from a location where there was no one around.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, but what was in fact only a moment after the demon had taken out the World Ending Bead, a red light shone from within the black bead. A massive red flame burst into the air, and this flame which seemed to destroy everything in its path directly devoured the Blood Demon.</p><p>The other Blood Demons stared with eyes full of shock. The moment the flame appeared they knew something was wrong, and all these demons that had launched themselves at Hui Yue halted mid-step, getting ready to rush back and retreat.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was not possible for them to escape. The flame ignited and moments after it devoured the Blood Demon like a massive bomb. It exploded outwards with a strength that made Hui Yue hold his breath.</p><p>A cold sweat appeared on his forehead as he gripped the Celestial Sword in his hands.</p><p>Lifting his hands, he felt the first shockwave from the explosion come towards him and he no longer fled. Instead, he firmly placed himself in position to receive it.</p><p>The first shockwave was the weakest of them all. It was from before the demon&#x2019;s entire lifeforce had ignited, and thus, Hui Yue was capable of cutting through it like a hot knife through butter.</p><p>He shielded himself with the dao-layered sword, and this first shockwave proved easy for him to deal with.</p><p>But the Blood Demons were not as lucky. Many of them were severely injured and burnt their lifeforce to try and escape faster, only to fail miserably.</p><p>As soon as the first shockwave passed, the next one erupted. It was more than ten times as strong as the first, and although Hui Yue easily dealt with the previous one, this would be quite different. His immaculate robes were also shredded to pieces while he tried to stand against the shockwave and his hair that had been tied up fell and covered his face, whipping around in the air.</p><p>This shockwave caused the blood in his body to roil. But he did not get the time to completely prepare for the next wave, and it was on him as soon as the second one had crashed. This one had gathered momentum, it had gathered in strength and was the second strongest of the shockwaves.</p><p>Hui Yue felt as if someone had stabbed him with thousand knives and then twisted the knives around within his body. Pain wracked his body making him grit his teeth as blood started streaming from the corner of his lips.</p><p>He was struggling against the shockwave, unable to cut through them, but also unwilling to give up and let them sweep him away.</p><p>While he was busy struggling with the shockwave the last, strongest wave hit him like a massive tidal wave. It swallowed him up whole, and his body, which had been struggling to stay in position shot backward like a kite that had its string cut.</p><p>The blood in his body was in an uproar, and his inner body, itself, was disintegrating. The shockwave had torn open massive wounds all over his body, and parts of his flesh had been ripped clean off.</p><p>Although this was the sturdiest body in the galaxy, there was a limit to how much it could handle, and this final shockwave pushed his body to its very limits.</p><p>He spat out mouthfuls of blood, his eyes were bloodshot, and although his body was stronger than any other body, it was simply not able to deal with so much energy hitting it. Now that it had passed, Hui Yue was worried.</p><p>He was laying in the middle of the void, incapable of moving even an inch. His body needed time to repair itself, and to do that he needed lifeforce.</p><p>Fortunately, Hui Yue had a surplus of lifeforce. He had stolen plenty from the Blood Demons during their slaughter these last few years, but even so, it would take a long time for this life force to slowly mend and heal his body.</p><p>This body was sturdy, and the foundations it was built upon were much more outstanding than other bodies one could find throughout the galaxy. This also meant that it consumed much more energy to repair itself.</p><p>Time went by, and the minutes felt like days. Hui Yue, who was acutely aware of what was happening around him, could not help but be worried.</p><p>Had any of the Blood Demons actually survived this terrible explosion? Would someone randomly come past his location? If so any random cultivator would be able to kill him with but a thought, and steal his sword which was laying next to him as well as all his items.</p><p>Fortunately, it seemed that none of the Blood Demons had survived. Hui Yue spread out his soulforce, but there was no lifeforce within the range that he could see.</p><p>Slowly, Hui Yue was able to sense his fingertips again, and they started twitching. After the twitching of his fingertips, a few more minutes passed, and he could clench his hand.</p><p>Like this time passed by. No one knew exactly how long it took for his body to be recreated from the lifeforce he had absorbed. It could have been minutes; it could have been days.</p><p>Hui Yue was lying motionless with bated breath, unsure of how long he would be able to lay like this, without anyone noticing him, but finally, he could slowly move his body again.</p><p>He was nowhere near his peak condition. He did not have his Ancestral Worldpower pool filled as he had emptied it completely in an all-out attempt to wrap his body in a protective layer, and all of it had been blasted to tiny bits, spreading all over the entire region.</p><p>Although compared to other cultivators at his level his rate of restoration was amazingly quick it still took time for him to reach his peak condition after using every single drop of Ancestral Worldpower in his body.</p><p>As he could move his body again, Hui Yue reached into the space of the Universe Box and withdrew all his friends alongside a set of clothes.</p><p>The friends were shocked when they saw Hui Yue&apos;s appearance. The remaining scraps of his clothes had been white with blue embroideries and no matter how serious a fight had gotten, these clothes had been untainted, yet now they were all dark red from the blood that had seeped into it.</p><p>Not even a tiny bit was white. All of it was in rags, and the red color made it stand out next to Hui Yue&apos;s white skin and hair. From this one could easily see just how dangerous the fight had been.</p><p>Hui Yue did not waste any time, he quickly removed the remaining bits and pieces of his old robe and wrapped another one around his body. He was feeling rather feeble at the moment, but he also knew that this was a way for him to have even more formidable foundations. His body, which was already the strongest in the galaxy, had been refined with lifeforce. His Ancestral Worldpower pool had been emptied completely, all his Ancestral Worldpower depleted, and in the process, his Ancestral Worldpower pool had increased in size.</p><p>He had found out how to superimpose his daos onto each other, he had gained an even more profound understanding into all the daos that he knew, and finally, he had managed to understand the might of the World Ending Bead.</p><p>He would never again look down on the Blood Demons. If they met more groups with these World Ending Beads, then they were likely to have a hard road ahead of them, but these beads were incredibly hard to refine. They required certain phenomena to be made, so it was highly likely that even the Blood Demons who had prepared for eons only had a few of them at their disposal.</p><p>Just as Hui Yue was about to fly forward, he stopped in his tracks, and an ugly expression appeared on his face.</p><p>&quot;Be careful! There are spatial fractures everywhere,&quot; he exclaimed with a grim expression. The World Ending Bead had caused more than just normal disturbances in the area; it had caused spatial fractures to appear everywhere like small spiderwebs! This was truly a bad situation for them.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
