Her face was dark, and the thoughts were clear on her face. She wanted to be the principal wife, but after thinking it through, she calmed herself and nodded her head.</p><p>&quot;I approve,&quot; she said through gritted teeth. It was clear that it took a lot out of her to agree to this, but it was something she would be ok with.</p><p>Huli, on the other hand, was stunned by the sudden offer and she stared shocked at Wang Ju Long, unable to say anything for a long time.</p><p>Only after hearing Sha Yun concurring to the suggestion did she seem to understand that she was to be Hui Yue&#x2019;s principal wife.</p><p>She said nothing, but for the first time that Hui Yue had ever seen, a blush appeared on her face, and a bashful look was sent towards Hui Yue who was at a loss for what to do.</p><p>He had not wanted to choose between the women; he loved all of them equally, but Wang Ju Long&apos;s words made sense to all of them.</p><p>Pei Tian also nodded his head with satisfaction, &quot;Seniority is always a good way to solve things. We all know that the rank of principal wife does not matter in reality, it is just something that others will care about.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, now that this has been decided, let&#x2019;s focus on the celebration,&quot; the patriarch smiled as he looked at the pale-looking Sha Yun, the thoughtful Wang Ju Long, and the bashful Huli.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x2019;s set the date for a year from now,&quot; the patriarch said as he nodded his head not caring at all about other&#x2019;s thoughts on the matter.</p><p>&quot;I will contact everyone from the major sects in the galaxy. Little Yue, you contact Yanluo yourself. I am sure he would prefer to be invited directly by you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Also, make sure to check out the wedding dresses in the City of Endless Clouds for your three fiancees. They have some first-class tailors that can make excellent dresses. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and everything needs to be perfect!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue felt slightly overwhelmed hearing how this wedding he had planned to be rather small was turning into such a big event. But he understood that this was an important occasion, not only for him but for the sect as well.</p><p>As he already knew this sect would be his home, Hui Yue wanted to help the sect. When he looked at the women, he saw that their eyes were shining and they were smiling brightly without realizing it.</p><p>To these women, a small wedding would be okay, but a grand wedding was something they wished to have. They wanted to scream out over the entire galaxy that Hui Yue belonged to them, but having a grand wedding where all the major sects showed up would be almost as good.</p><p>Since everyone around him seemed to want a grand wedding, Hui Yue just shrugged his shoulders and allowed for them to come up with the decisions on their own.</p><p>No one really expected Hui Yue to participate in the planning, but Huli, Sha Yun, and Wang Ju Long were very eager to share their opinions, and the patriarch was more than welcoming about every point they made.</p><p>Soon the four of them were deep in discussions with one another, talking about the wedding to the tiniest detail.</p><p>Hui Yue was left behind as they started discussing everything. He just stood there looking rather perplexed. His uncle, the patriarch, was busy chatting with his women, and his father had found a chair from only god knows where and was sitting still, leaning back in it enjoying the sight of his brother and daughters-in-law discussing the wedding.</p><p>He was not even upset over the fact that his brother had taken over the wedding. Shaking his head, Hui Yue searched the Universe Box and found that he too had a chair pushed away in the depths of his never-ending space. He dragged the chair out and sat down as well.</p><p>Seeing the people in front of him discussing lively, it was clear that he was in for a long wait this time.</p><p>After a day and night had gone by, every single detail of the wedding had been discussed, and everyone was happy with what they had come up with.</p><p>Wang Ju Long, Sha Yun, and Huli spent most of their time at the mountain belonging to the patriarch where the four of them were preparing the wedding, while Hui Yue was visiting people who mattered to him.</p><p>He visited the experts he was good friends with from when he lived in the sect before, and he also visited his teacher of formations and engaged in a Formation Master&apos;s debate with him. After the sparring match, the two of them had to admit that they were now equal in every sense of the word.</p><p>When Hui Yue had left on his journey to find the long-lost Alchemist God, he had been far from his teacher&apos;s equal in the art of formations, yet now things had changed. Hui Yue had absorbed the soulforce of the formation in the Archaic World, and his soulforce had been nurtured by consuming the seals. In addition to the pill he had received from the Alchemist God.</p><p>While Hui Yue was busy visiting friends, invitations to his wedding made their way across the entire galaxy.</p><p>&quot;This Pei Yue is the youngster who beat you in the trial to become a Judge of Hell?&quot; an elder said while looking at a black-clothed youth who nodded his head.</p><p>&quot;He won fairly. His power was greater than mine, but I will show him that I have improved greatly since our last battle!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are going for a wedding,&quot; the elder warned the youth. &quot;We are not there to start a fight, however, if the opportunity presents itself, then feel free to spar against him. I would like to see if he is still able to defeat your Shadow World.&quot;</p><p>Similar conversations appeared throughout all the major sects in the galaxy. Some had seen Hui Yue at the Formation Master&apos;s debate; others had seen him at the trials to become a Judge of Hell.</p><p>Even those who had never seen him before had heard about him, and they were all eager to see this talented genius who had emerged from the Celestial Sword Sect. They wanted to see the youth who had made the sect second to only Diyu and Yanluo&apos;s Ten Courts of Hell.</p><p>Realizing that invitations were sent out, Hui Yue rushed home to contact Yanluo. He took out the communication orb.</p><p>&quot;You little brat, I hear you are getting married to three beauties!&quot; Yanluo did not even care to greet Hui Yue. His face had a great smile on it although his words sounded harsh, he meant nothing by it.</p><p>&quot;I am contacting you to invite you, and everyone else who feels like coming, to the wedding,&quot; Hui Yue responded causally.</p><p>&quot;Everyone who feels like going? That is so vague!&quot; Yanluo complained, but Hui Yue just shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>&quot;I understand that not all the judges can leave at the same time,&quot; he admitted, &quot;but they want this event to be massive, and thus, I am inviting you all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Also by inviting everyone... Even if they can&apos;t go, it means they ought to prepare a wedding gift for us,&quot; he continued with a cheeky smile on his face, and his words caused Yanluo to snort.</p><p>&quot;So it turns out that what matters is the wedding presents and not the actual judges&apos; appearance at your wedding!&quot;</p><p>Yanluo paused and considered for a moment before he flashed a grin at Hui Yue. &quot;Since they want it to be grand, then grand it will be! Diyu will send a big delegation this time and with presents that others cannot surpass.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue knew that the reason Yanluo was willing to do so much was because of everything Hui Yue had done for him previously, but he did not mind. This wedding was important, and even if he had to use a favor owed him, he would still ask them to come as he wanted this to be the biggest celebration that the galaxy had ever seen.</p><p>The Celestial Sword Sect spent a fortune on buying delicacies from all over the galaxy; they spent a lot of effort in getting everything ready for the celebration.</p><p>It had been decided that the wedding would last a whole week, and during this week of celebration, they would open the sect to outsiders for the first time.</p><p>Opening the sect was something many elders were against. They feared that some of the visitors might have malicious intent, but after thinking that both Yanluo and the elders of the Celestial Sword Sect would be present, everyone calmed down and approved of the idea.</p><p>Days went by in a flash, and Hui Yue got news that the other friends of his had made it back to their guardian sects, but news about his wedding had also spread to all the guardian sects. For this reason, all of the sects were fighting with each other to see who could provide the best wedding presents.</p><p>Although his friends had a great relationship with the guardian sects before, it was nothing compared to now. Everyone wished to make friends with the beast Gods and all Hui Yue&#x2019;s good friends in an attempt to get closer to him.</p><p>Soon the news about this grand marriage was all anyone was talking about. Even the ones who had not originally been apart of the great sects came to know about it, and many of the minor sects also prepared gifts to send to Hui Yue.</p><p>The rumors about his marriage made it all the way to the Blissful realm, and even the owner of this realm could not help but be surprised when she received an invitation to the wedding.</p><p>Everyone who was a Crowned Sovereigns had been invited. The ones who owned sects had been allowed to bring more than one person, and the greater the sect, the more people they could bring.</p><p>During the year of preparations, a new hall was built. Although the sect had many places to host weddings, they had nowhere big enough for such a massive event as this was going to be therefore they started building a hall that could house over hundred thousand experts.</p><p>This hall was grand and extravagant. It was built on a mountain just at the edge of the sect, and it was surrounded by beautiful lush forest with a waterfall at the back.</p><p>The forest was leveled, and gardens were created all around the hall. Looking at it, it was the most idyllic place in the entire sect. Although it was within the sect, it was still relatively secluded ensuring that no one would by accident wander into the heart of the sect itself.</p><p>It took them ten months to get all preparations finished, and by the time the eleventh month begun, guests and presents started pouring in from all over the galaxy.</p><p>Many of the gifts were from people Hui Yue had never even heard about before. It was from recluse cultivators, major families, members of the Yanluo Guard, and various mercenaries and adventurers to name a few. The gifts came from such a wide variety of experts that it was hard to remember them all.</p><p>The guests all required an invitation card to be allowed to enter the sect, and the first to arrive were groups of excited guardian sect disciples with their sect masters.</p><p>All of them, even the sect masters of these guardian sects, treated the beast Gods with reverence, and the ones who walked at the front were not the sect masters but the beast Gods that belonged to the sects.</p><p>Hui Yue personally welcomed all of them and led them to the temporary premises which had been set up for them.</p><p>The Celestial Sword Sect had many valleys, and although the most popular ones were occupied, the more remote ones were free. More than one hundred thousand valleys were free, and they were now used to house the many guests that were constantly pouring in.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
