With this decision, his eyes shone with determination. </span></p><p><span style="">He looked at the suns created from his formation. A chilling light shone in his eyes as the suns started locating themselves where the demons were. The suns began burning a black mist around the demons. </span></p><p><span style="">The demons in this area paid no attention to the suns and black mist. Once all the black mist was absorbed by the suns, these suns descended into groups. Suddenly, Hui Yue clenched his fist and the suns detonated with tremendous force, destroying thousands of demons in the wake of their explosion. </span></p><p><span style="">Hui Yue had infused these suns with all of Lan Feng&apos;s understanding of the dao of fire. The heat they contained was so overwhelming that another ten thousand demons were wounded, blinded and completely dazed for a moment. </span></p><p><span style="">The demon army in front of Hui Yue and his entourage numbered up to a hundred thousand demons. Yet the majority of them were all primordial immortals; thus, they could only be used as cannon fodder and an attempt to overpower the powerhouses from the Yanluo Guard.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well let us take a thousand demons each!&quot; The captain said. His words caused the other guards to cheer out and lift their weapons, &quot;The young master has already decimated quite a few, but we cannot fall behind. The person who will slaughter the most will be given a pill of clarity!&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">The guards all roared out in excitement while the demons&apos; faces sank. This outcome was not going the way they wanted it to.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Let us see if they can even enter the deck and fight us,&quot; the captain smirked. He and the rest of the guards released their Ancestral Worldpower and merged it with the ship. The inscriptions and formations started humming. These inscriptions and formations shot forward into the crowd of demons. Some were crushed by the force of the ship-like shuttle; others were wounded by lights that shone out from the inscriptions,</span></p><p><span style="">Hui Yue did not wait for a moment. He instantly started creating a new formation. This formation was the tempest that Pei Bai had used in the first formation master&apos;s debate only added with wind blades.</span></p><p><span style="">These wind blades were incredibly powerful as they were backed by both the tempest and Hui Yue&apos;s daos of the wind. They swept through the demons that were grouped around the ship-shuttle. These wind blades cut them to pieces and killed multiple experts with every single movement. </span></p><p><span style="">Whereas the friends and the guards could do nothing but pour their energy into the ship-like shuttle and bring out the might of the defensive inscriptions and formations, Hui Yue&apos;s attacks directly left the protective layer around the ship, in turn, attacking the demons in the distance. </span></p><p><span style="">The ship plowed forward, crushing demon after demon on the path, leaving a river of blood behind. Nonetheless, no matter how many were killed, more continued to pour towards them, beating at the ship&apos;s protective layer, causing it to shake. </span></p><p><span style="">At first, the shaking had been almost unnoticeable. As the time went on, it became more and more intense. The loud booms sounded out as the barrier around them shook. </span></p><p><span style="">Hui Yue spent all his soul force to control his formations and cut a straight line through the advancing demons.</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;This is pathetic,&apos; Lan Feng commented while Hui Yue just slew another ten experts with one wind blade. &apos;They are all very weak. Although there are quite a lot of demons here, they are nowhere near capable enough to kill us. All they can do is stall us for some time.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Can it be that they were sent here to be sacrificed for some reason or another? Who sent them and what purpose could he possibly have to send these many demons?&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Demons are the race which works under the judges of hell. Even so, there are demons all over the galaxy. At the start they were slaves, but now this is no longer the case. They are a flourishing race which grows stronger every day. Because they used to be slaves some of these demons, however, feel hostility towards the ten judges of hell and Diyu. They used to be treated differently, and thus they wish for vengeance. There are even tales about blood sacrifices where humans are being made into demons!&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">&apos;Anyway, I am sure these are one of those rebellious groups of demons that wish for the judges of hell to vanish from the face of the earth. Though if Diyu and the judges did vanish, I wonder what would happen to reincarnation and all mortals who died. Will they just be dead forever? Or will another system come into place? I don&apos;t know.&apos;</span></p><p><span style="">Lan Feng continued to muse about what might happen if the judges of hell all died, but Hui Yue just shook his head and chuckled. It was clear that he had allowed for his thoughts to spin out of control and forget all about the perilous situation they were in right now. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Well I got nothing better to do, so I might as well just continue to slaughter my way through these demons. Their souls are nourishing my soul force, and their blood is flowing like rivers. I have nothing against them, but they chose to block my path. In such case, it is either kill or be killed.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Reaching this conclusion, Hui Yue&apos;s eyes glistened with coldness as his hands continued to guide the seals around him into one formation after another. Soul force continued to pour out of him, However, at the same time, he was also constantly nourished by consuming the souls of those he killed, allowing for him to wantonly use the newly acquired energy.</span></p><p><span style="">The Yanluo Guard was rather dumbfounded as they looked at Hui Yue. He was a primordial immortal. Nevertheless, looking at him slaughtering demon after demon, even a few Immortals of Creation succumbed to the formations, these guards understood that they might have underestimated their young master.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;He was not using formations when he fought in the tournament,&quot; one of the guards muttered just loud enough for the others to hear; they all shook their heads. Hui Yue had been known for his outstanding fighting methods during the competition to become the judge of hell. Nevertheless, now he was using formations as if he had been born to be a formation master.</span></p><p><span style="">These formations were able to somewhat lift the pressure on the rest of the group. It was clear that he was fairly close to becoming a formation grandmaster. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Was he hiding his strength during the competition or did he just start understanding formations afterward?&quot; the captain mumbled to himself as he looked at Hui Yue with strange eyes. No matter which one of them was true, both would be shocking!</span></p><p><span style="">Although Hui Yue&#x2019;s fighting capabilities were shocking, it was also a great improvement in their groups fighting capacity, making everyone feel excited. </span></p><p><span style="">The ship continued to plow its way through The inscriptions were constantly shining, sending out light blade after light blade, chopping down anything in their wake; the formations even rumbled as they took attack after attack but stayed in place. </span></p><p><span style="">The thousand layer formation that Hui Yue had placed was finally showing signs of cracking, and Hui Yue&apos;s eyes narrowed as he saw it. </span></p><p><span style="">A thousand layer formation required the formation master to use a hundred seals to lay down a formation, but this was a stationary formation, and when he used the seals, they would forever be lost to him. </span></p><p><span style="">Even though this was the case, Hui Yue did not hesitate as he withdrew some of his wind blades and got ready to once more lay down the thousand layer formation. </span></p><p><span style="">The moment he laid up on the offense against the demons, they all flooded the boat. Hui Yue frowned from this reaction from the demons, and he instantly created more wind blades to chop down the ones who had gotten too close.</span></p><p><span style="">If he wanted to make a thousand layer formation, he would need to focus fully on the formation he had to make. However, if he did that, then a huge group of demons would flock the ship. Then the protection would fail before the new formation was laid down. </span></p><p><span style="">Since this was the case, Hui Yue understood that all he could do was fight. He had to fight as many demons as possible, and when the barrier surrounding them fell, he would fight even harder. </span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry too much,&quot; Xiao Ning suddenly said with a grin on his face as he noticed Hui Yue&apos;s frown. &quot;We have all trained for quite some time. We are all strong enough to deal with most gods that pose a threat to us. The ones here are all cannon fodder. Killing them will be easy, and if we actually meet our match then we will come running to your side!&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">Having said that, the other beast gods and friends laughed and nodded their heads. It was clear that they too were eager to join the battle. </span></p><p><span style="">Seeing them like this caused Hui Yue to shake his head with a smile. He felt much better after this. It was true; these experts were not weaklings, they had been training just as hard as he had, and they were all waiting for a time to display their prowess to Hui Yue.</span></p><p><span style="">Smiling like this, Hui Yue returned to his position at the front of the ship; he continued to throw more and more wind blades after the demons. If he had looked at them, he would see that a road of carnage had been carved in the middle of the galaxy. A sea of blood was starting to appear, and a sweet scent of blood filled the air. </span></p><p><span style="">All around cracks kept appearing as more and more of the formation that kept the demons out started breaking. Finally, it could hold no more. A loud boom resounded as the formations that kept the people inside safe collapsed. Thousands of demons appeared on the ship deck, ready to brandish their weapons and engage in close quarters combat. </span></p><p><span style="">Hui Yue prepared himself to fight in close combat as well. When he noticed that no demons managed to reach him, he saw that he was surrounded by the Yanluo Guards and that all of them held back the demon horde.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;Keep using your formations!&quot; the captain ordered, &quot;they can kill many at once and has a great benefit in large scale battles. We will keep you safe so just slaughter away!&quot; </span></p><p><span style="">The order was clear as day, and Hui Yue approved of it. He instantly released his seals and the soul force within himself as he created the Ten Sun formation and exploded the suns one after another, dragging with them more and more demons. </span></p><p><span style="">Burning flames started to appear on the ship; smoke filled the air. Everywhere Hui Yue looked he found carnage. The demons were obviously much weaker than the guards and his friends. Even if, they were in numerous numbers. </span></p><p><span style="">Hui Yue&apos;s eyes flickered with coldness as he noticed that the end of the demon horde was in sight. Nevertheless, at the very end stood a group of Immortals of Creation which was nothing like the one&apos;s they had encountered so far.</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;I see,&quot; he mumbled. His eyes filled with killing intent. &quot;These many demons were solely here to make us waste our energy. The more energy we wasted, the better, then the elite demons would appear and take our heads.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="">&quot;As if I would ever let that happen!&quot; he exclaimed, and he clenched his fist. Suddenly vials with a great fragrance of medicinal herbs appeared in the middle of the battlefield. Hui Yue called out, &quot;Everyone, each take a pill each, restore your energy! We are about to face someone troublesome!&quot;</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
