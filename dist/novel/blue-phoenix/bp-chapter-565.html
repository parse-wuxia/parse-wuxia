Hui Yue was a third generation descendant, and thus he had no hard tasks to do and could spend every day cultivating.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he cultivated daily, he got no resources from the sect. Anyone below twenty years was not considered a cultivator, and the sect wanted the children to enjoy their childhood.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if someone showed stunning abilities before they turned twenty, no one took it to heart. This was because one&apos;s talent could not be measured before their body had stabilized and that was a procedure that took twenty years.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Hui Yue was five years old. He spent his time cultivating and stabilizing his body, but he also spent a lot of his time in the library where he would read up on the galaxy and the amazing world outside of the sect.</p><p dir="ltr">He was not old when he realized that death was a very common occurrence in the world, that people died all the time, and that death was a natural part of life.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue learned about the Netherworld, Diyu, Youdu, and the Yellow River, and he nodded his head thoughtfully when he read that one could come back from the Yellow River if there were enough incentive to convince He Bo, the Earl of the Yellow River, to their let soul go.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was but a child, but he understood the world well. It did not take long before he was the most knowledgeable child of all his siblings, but to achieve such depth of knowledge, he spent more and more time in the library and slept less and less because he refused to take time from his cultivation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Gods did not need to sleep, one has to remember that this was a child whose body was still not solidified. These children truly needed sleep and food much like any mortal children to be able to cope through the day, but even though he knew this, Hui Yue continued to sleep less and work harder.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was a very timid child, but all his other siblings liked him. Hui Yue would tell them about the outside would. He would tell them stories of legendary figures, and recently he had become friends with the elder and quite a few members of the department of the sect that focused on the information gathering for the sect. He talked about the fascinating things he heard with his older brothers and sisters.</p><p dir="ltr">These children were all either already sect disciples training hard, or they were cultivating and solidifying their body. Nobody was like Hui Yue and took time to read history and learn about the many worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">Even Pei Tian noticed that this son of his was different from the others, but he did not mind. Someone who hungered for knowledge was likely to manage through the world one way or another; strength was not the only thing that mattered!</p><p dir="ltr">Time flowed on and Hui Yue never really encountered any hardships in the sect. Some of the other children would look down on Pei Yue, but his older brothers and sisters would always defend him. This was enough as no one wished to fight a whole village of children and for this reason, Hui Yue grew up rather sheltered.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly, the time had come to test Hui Yue&apos;s talent. This was something he had looked forward to for many years already. Now that it was his turn to be tested both his brothers, sisters, and mother were fussing at him and doing everything they could to encourage him.</p><p dir="ltr">The truth was that not many believed he had the talent for cultivation. As a matter of fact, they all assumed that he was quite behind in this aspect. This was because he was much more focused on using his time to study in the library, but nobody really cared. They liked him for who he was and would support him nonetheless. Even the other wives loved hearing about the outside world from little Yue as they called him.</p><p dir="ltr">There were no villages at the foot of the mountains, but there were some of the sect&#x2019;s most important buildings there. Amongst them, one was the Pavilion of Talent.</p><p dir="ltr">It was within this building that Hui Yue was to be tested, and he walked towards it with a rapid beating heart and great anticipation. Although he had not focused on cultivation, he was still certain that cultivation was what he wanted to do the most. He wished to become a cultivator and stun everyone with his heroic efforts. He, himself, believed that he was a genius.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As he reached the Pavilion of Talent, Hui Yue could barely breathe as he pushed open the door and entered the dimly lit room.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Inside he found nothing more than a desk and an elderly man, and when he looked at this elderly man, his heart shook. There was no doubt that this person was a true expert!</p><p dir="ltr">There were a few other older students within the pavilion. It seemed like they were all here to test their current strength.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was one of the most renowned places within the entire sect, and everyone treated the elder who was in charge of this place with great respect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue went to the desk and reached out his hand. He presented to the elder his token which appeared in his hand. This was the token of his identity which included his day of birth, his name, and what generation he was a part of.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Accepting the token, the older man looked at it for a moment before he stood up. In his hand was a small glass orb with various translucent rings in the middle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There was a total of nine rings, and Hui Yue knew that this was the orb that was used to test one&apos;s talents. The more rings one could light up the better one&apos;s talents was.</p><p dir="ltr">If the cultivator lit up three rings or below, then they were below average. Four to six rings meant one had average talent, and seven to nine rings meant that one was above average. Getting nine rings was an incredibly hard task, and it meant that one&#x2019;s talent was the best it could be.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s aim was obviously to rank above average, but he also knew that this was exceedingly difficult. Within the sect, the majority ranked between six and seven rings due to their bloodline, but few ever managed to light up all nine rings. Those who did were the ones that the sect gave their best resources to; they carried all their expectations.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue wanted to be one of these people. His innermost wish to be a true talent was so overwhelming, but when he touched the glass orb and entered his Ancestral Worldpower, all he succeeded in doing was lighting up six rings.</p><p dir="ltr">One has to know that his talent was not bad. Six rings were already considered the top of the average experts, not many outside the main sects had such talents, but within the sect, it as still only considered average.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Realizing that he was not the genius that he expected himself to be, Hui Yue was depressed for a long time. While he was feeling down, his brothers, sister, and mother were filled with excitement. None of them had expected that he would have such good talent and they held a banquet for him. Even Pei Tian arrived and showed how pleased he was with Hui Yue&#x2019;s talent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue slowly came to terms with the fact that he was not a peerless genius. He understood that he was an average expert. If he wished to be as great as he had hoped, then he would need to train many times harder than everyone else. It would take him longer far longer to comprehend a dao, and it would also take him longer to accumulate Ancestral Worldpower. But just because it would take him longer did not mean that it was impossible.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Filled with a newfound resolve Hui Yue became a disciple of the Celestial Sword Sect. He had become a member of the younger generation and was once more looked after by his family.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They often gave him medicinal pills they no longer needed, and gave him pointers on how to increase his strength, cultivate, and fight.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Celestial Sword Sect was split into several divisions, and as soon as one joined the sect as a disciple, they had to chose which divisions they wanted to join.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had instantly chosen to join the department in charge of gathering information from outside of the sect.</p><p dir="ltr">When Hui Yue made this decision, no one was surprised. He had always loved gathering information and sharing it with his family. Choosing this path in life would let him learn even more about the worlds around him.</p><p dir="ltr">Time flowed onwards, and Hui Yue started to grasp the dao. He would often ponder the many mysteries of the dao of the sword. This was the first dao every single member of the Celestial Sword Sect would learn as all of them had grown up with a sword in their hands.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Together with this dao, Hui Yue slowly built up enough contribution points from doing easy missions to enter the Skill Pavilion a few times. Every time he entered, he chose Ancestral Worldpower Skills.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although his talent was only average, he forced himself to spend every waking moment training and cultivating to ensure that he could perfect these Ancestral Worldpower Skills within a few years.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not a talented genius in the sect. He was just one of the more average talents, but he never let his family down, and he soon came to terms with the fact that he was not going to become an outstanding talent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, he was happy. He had found the right place for himself. The division he was in was perfect, and all the curiosity he had towards the world outside was sated with what he could learn from the elders. He was very well liked.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Hui Yue took a mission that took him outside the sect. Hui Yue had been filled with excitement. It was finally time for him to enter the world outside and see the places he had read about since childhood.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He entered the outside world and had succeeded his mission painlessly. But, sadly, on his way back he was stopped by a group of bandits.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he fought a brave fight and managed to take two of the bandits with him to the grave, he was eventually running out of stamina. He was but a young God, and he did not have much Ancestral Worldpower. This on top of only comprehending one dao and a few Ancestral Worldpower Skills put him at a severe disadvantage.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue never again returned to the Celestial Sword Sect. All the items on his body were split between the bandits. They removed every trace of them ever being close to Hui Yue, ensuring that no one was capable of returning to gain revenge.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not a genius of the sect, and thus he had no guards with him when he went out to train on missions. If he had just a little bit more talent then the sect would have sent some guards with him to protect him, but he did not have the talent to warrant such treatment.</p><p dir="ltr">Now that he was merging with Hui Yue, the current him felt gratitude and excitement. It was clear that this expert who had wished to become a genius understood that his wish had been granted. He was indeed a genius now. Now, he could make his father proud. Now if he faced the same group of bandits, he could wipe the floor with them. All his dreams had been granted, albeit many thousands of years late.</p><br></div><p></p>
