Right now, he was very nervous.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In his other hand was the vial which contained Wang Ju Long&apos;s soul. This vial had never been opened since the soul had been caught. Hui Yue was simply too worried that she would dissipate into thin air, so his usually steady hands trembled as he gently opened the lid.</p><p dir="ltr">A mist-like vapor hung suspended in the air; the vapor had taken the shape of a face, a face that Hui Yue knew all too well.</p><p dir="ltr">Watching the beautiful features of Wang Ju Long&apos;s face, Hui Yue felt his heart tighten and was unsure of how to proceed forward. He was afraid that the flame would be too intense and burn her soul, but he also understood that this was the only way to strengthen her soul.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The soul that was lingering in the air had open eyes, but they were completely vacant. They looked around the room casually, but it seemed as if they remembered nothing, not even Hui Yue. The eyes only casually glanced at him.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue felt sad and guilty as he saw this, but he also became determined. He lifted up the wisp of fire that he held in his hand and moved it towards the mist-like face. The closer it came, the more it started heating up as if it was reacting in response to the soul nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s eyes were sharp, and the only thing he looked at was the flame and the soul. Right now, nothing else mattered; it was as if there was nothing else in the world as he slowly moved the flame closer and closer. He moved it closer until finally it was in the range of the soul that was suspended in the air. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The flame was slowly being drawn towards the soul. The wisp turned into small specks of light, and these specks were all absorbed by the soul bit by bit. The more specks it absorbed, the less mist-like the face became as it turned more visible.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although it was becoming more real, it was still only a face, and not only this, the eyes were still completely vacant. There was no sign of a reaction from her; there were only her lingering dead, cold eyes that stared back at Hui Yue and the world carelessly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue remembered what Yama had told him and after seeing that the entire wisp of flame had been absorbed by her soul, he did not instantly find another wisp and force her to absorb it. He understood that if he continued to feed this soul the flame, then it would explode. Her soul would simply be incapable of absorbing and refining the flame so quickly so instead he had to nurture her slowly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the flame had vanished, there were constant changes to the mist-like face. Slowly it turned much more real, and soon Hui Yue could no longer see through&#xA0;the face as it just hovered in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is going to take some time,&quot; Hui Yue admitted as he saw that the flame had a great effect, but the look in her eyes still deeply hurt him. Her eyes were so vacant, and they filled Hui Yue with pain.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I can&apos;t afford to use the Nirvana Phoenix Flame for anything else!&quot; He said to himself determinedly as he looked at the flame which had shrunk some. &quot;I will need all of it to heal Wang Ju Long&apos;s soul.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;At least, the soul is constantly healing from the small wisp it consumed; now I just need to wait.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;While she is busy healing, you should spend this time increasing your strength,&apos; Lan Feng&apos;s voice rung in Hui Yue&apos;s mind. &apos;Wang Ju Long will become a God when she enters the body you have refined for her since it will be the body of a God, but her soul might still be lacking at that time. While she is strengthening her soul so she can fully control such a body, you will need to be by her side and protect her. At that time to do so, you will need to be many time more powerful than your current self!&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head. This was something he understood. It had troubled him for quite some time the fact that Wang Ju Long would be a half-God half-mortal. He needed to protect her at that time! He would never let anything like this happen to her again!!</p><p dir="ltr">Closing his eyes, Hui Yue felt how all the energy had left his body as he had used it all for the Nirvana Phoenix Flame.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was a common occurrence; this was not the first time he had lost his energy after using the flame.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue knew that he needed to replenish his Ancestral Worldpower, but before that, he picked up the vial from which the soul was suspended.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After a last, long glance at Wang Ju Long&apos;s beautiful face, Hui Yue sighed deeply and gently nudged the soul back into the vial. He quickly closed it and heaved a heavy sigh. He was not sure if he felt relieved or depressed now that she was back and safe within the vial.</p><p dir="ltr">On one hand, he was happy that she was safe and excited to see how she would look when she next left the vial to absorb more of the Nirvana Phoenix Flame, but on the other hand, he was also worried and depressed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He was depressed because he could no longer look at her face, and he was also sad that she was once more forced to have her soul confined within the small vial. He wished for Wang Ju Long to be free, to roam the world. He wanted her to get her body back and be happy. Unfortunately, that was not a possibility just yet, and all he could do was sigh.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as the vial was safely stored within the Universe Box once more, Hui Yue sat down on the ground and started absorbing the Ancestral Worldpower he had lost from using the Nirvana Phoenix Flame.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It took him a full two days before he was back in his peak condition, but when he was, he felt much better than before. Not only that, but his Ancestral Worldpower pool had also increased from before. Draining all his Ancestral Worldpower had caused him to deepen the amount of energy that his body could hold.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is really going quite fast,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself in astonishment as he felt that he was quickly advancing through the Primordial Immortal rank, but soon a voice from Lan Feng interrupted him. &apos;It is clear that you are using a cheat,&apos; he complained.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Not that I am in any position to complain, you getting stronger is great news for me, but you should know that no normal person would be able to advance as perfectly and smoothly as you can.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Some of it is due to King Yanluo giving you a new body, that made your strength skyrocket, but it is also because you have so many benefits from my resurrection. Your previous lives have strengthened your soul tremendously. This has increased your talent drastically, and it has also increased the speed with which you cultivate.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Truthfully, I am jealous,&apos; Lan Feng said with a gleam in his eyes. &apos;But then I realized that you and I share a soul so even when I am leaving your body and get my own, I will still have the same benefits as now.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head but said nothing. He contemplated what he should do next. While thinking, he was subconsciously creating a seal in his hands.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Creating seals had proven to be a hard task now that he had reached the first ten seals, but after a bit of time, he successfully managed to form the eleventh.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although it required some focus, the biggest problem was compressing so much soulforce into a seal. Thus he ended up failing quite a few times.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The more times he tried, the more familiar he got with the process, but even so, compressing so much soulforce required a bit of luck. Therefore, he could only continue to fail time and time again before creating the twelfth, thirteenth, and then fourteenth seal.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This whole time Hui Yue was considering what to do next, but there were simply so many things he needed to do. Sadly, he did not have the time to do everything.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One of the things was to gather contribution points. To get these points he needed to complete missions, and these missions were varied in difficulty, but all of them would require time to finish.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Another thing he needed to do was master the rest of the beginner formations that he had gained from the Formation Palace.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Apart from that, he wished to look into inscriptions to increase his damage output with them. He also wished to know more about inscriptions in general.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What do you think?&quot; Hui Yue asked Lan Feng who was quiet for a short amount of time, but Lan Feng did not answer right away.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;I think that the best idea would be to get contribution points. There are a few missions that can be done here at the school itself. Some of them tell you to challenge a specific amount of people and win against them in the arena while others are miscellaneous tasks for the library or the different mansions and palaces to do boring things.&apos;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Although these missions within the sect give far fewer contribution points, I don&apos;t think you should leave the sect just yet not even for the sake of contribution points,&apos; Lan Feng said honestly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;You have a lot of enemies. When you are within the sect, no one can move against you, yet the moment you go outside anyone could attack you. You saw that some of the elders are against you and thus my idea for you is to be extra careful.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head as it made sense. &quot;I guess our best bet is to go to the Mission Tower and have a look at the missions in the sect.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having reached this decision, Hui Yue did not linger any longer and instead stood up.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Just as he was about to leave, he ran into his father. This was something that surprised the both of them. When one looked at Pei Tian it almost looked as if he had forgotten that another person was living within his mountain, yet the moment he saw Hui Yue&apos;s face a tenderness appeared in his eyes, and he smiled gently.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;How are you? And how do you like it here so far?&quot; He asked gently, clearly interested and not just asking because one would expect him to do so.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am good, and I very much like it here,&quot; Hui Yue answered honestly. &quot;No one is trying to trouble me, and I can train in peace. Of course, it does require quite a bit of wealth, and since I am not willing to keep using my Worldpower Stones, I am going to go to the Mission Tower to try and get my hands on some easy missions that are within the sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue hid nothing; he said the truth. This man was his father, and he could feel the care and affection that the older man felt for him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I could give you some Worldpower Stones, but the truth is that the price for everything is stupidly high if you pay with Worldpower Stones. I would also suggest you work hard and get your hands on some contribution points. Sadly, those are not something I can gift you.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But even so, if you need anything come and ask your old man. I will do what is in my power to help you out. I am not as useless as some might think.&quot; He said with a gentle smile and laughter.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
