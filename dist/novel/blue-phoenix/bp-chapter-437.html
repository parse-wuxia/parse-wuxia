His aura was now different than it had been before; it was much now more majestic now. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long came running the moment they heard the good news. Smiles lit up their faces, and their hearts beat rapidly from excitement. </span></p><br><p><span style="">On Hui Yue&apos;s shoulder sat Huli, and the small fox was seated as though it felt ownership over Hui Yue while looking down on everyone with arrogant eyes. The small fox had never taken a liking to anyone other than Hui Yue, and now that it decided to leave his room, it was as arrogant as ever. If anyone tried to touch it, then they would be scratched or bitten.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Having successfully broken into the Saint ranks, Hui Yue had some maids to invite his friends to come celebrate his success. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Shortly after everyone found out, the mansion was busy with activity. The kitchen was filled with servants running back and forth carrying plates and delicacies, and the maids were preparing rooms for the soon to arrive guests. With the whole mansion talking breakthrough this information inevitably spread outside to the city. </span></p><br><p><span style="">His friends quickly hurried over, and even Ma Kong, who was busy dealing with some business for the Black Market Auction House, rushed to the mansion to celebrate with Hui Yue. The Rong twins left the academy, and Gao Yan quickly left the Black Lion. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Soon the mansion&apos;s dining hall was filled with people. Not only his friends but even the City Lord and various patriarchs from many important families in Muchuan City who had also heard the news rushed towards the mansion to congratulate this young man who had shaken the city time and time again.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;To think that he really was not a Saint before...&quot; was one of the most spoken sentences that day. Many of the patriarchs were shocked when they knew about this. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, to think that you reached the Saint rank at such a young age!&quot; Xiao Ning&apos;s burly voice sounded through the entire dining hall; everyone quieted down a little bit as they eagerly eavesdropped on what was being said between the two friends. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;To think that even you came.&quot; Hui Yue laughed clearly aware that everyone was listening, but simply could not be bothered to care. On his shoulder, Huli looked at Xiao Ning with interest. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;When I heard that you reached the Saint rank I had to rush over.&quot; He said. He too seemingly did not pay attention to the world around him, or he simply did not notice that the talk within the hall had turned lower than usual. Some people were mumbling on purpose, pretending to speak but they were not saying anything important. Everyone listened intently because they all wished to know how Hui Yue, someone who just became a Saint, had had the ability to fight across ranks. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Hey, is that the fox you found in the grave?&quot; Xiao Ning asked, and Hui Yue nodded his head. The two started talking about their experiences in the grave and Ye Ling, Zhu Jun, and Lou Qiang all appeared together. They had brought with them storage stones full of herbs. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;We want to give you this for finally reaching the Saint rank.&quot; Ye Ling spoke out. &quot;But, sadly, we could not find anything which was the perfect match for you. In the end, we decided on herbs. As an alchemist, we figured you could always use herbs. The different plants are mostly from the grave alongside some rare herbs we had in our treasuries.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing their words, Hui Yue was touched. These three men and him had gone through a lot together. At first he had intended to kill them but now he was very happy that he had not. They had proven to be real friends and truly valued him highly. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue, who was speaking with the four Saints he had teamed up with in the grave frowned for a moment as he looked at the door. Someone entered through, and he was surprised to see that this person was Rong Liang, the father of the Rong twins.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Hui Yue!&quot; He called out excitedly. Although he had been a King the last time Hui Yue saw him, it was clear that this was no longer the case. His aura was very similar to Hui Yue&apos;s, and he was clearly a Saint. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Lord Rong!&quot; Hui Yue said surprised with pleasure in his voice. He was very pleased to see this City Lord because he had not seen him since he left Riluo City so long ago. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;How come you&#x2019;re here?&quot; He asked curiously and looked at the older man who he had spent a lot of time with earlier in his life. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I was here to visit my children. Quite a while ago, I wished to see you as well but heard that you had entered a closed door training. After hearing that you broke into the Saint ranks, I was truly shocked!&quot; Rong Liang was indeed excited. His eyes shone with pride, and his laughter rang across the room.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was a little startled to see that every Saint in the room looked at Rong Liang with surprise and slight fear. Their fear was something that Hui Yue did not understand. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Suddenly the City Lord of Muchuan City got some courage and moved towards Hui Yue and Rong Liang. Bowing so deeply that he almost fell to the ground, the City Lord finally opened his mouth. &quot;Lord Rong, I would never have assumed that you would have such an intimate relationship with our Hui Yue. Would you mind me asking what the relationship between the two of you is?&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing the way they treated Rong Liang, Hui Yue was surprised and shocked. He knew Rong Liang, but he only knew him as the City Lord of Riluo City, but it seemed as though he had another job alongside this task.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Haha, Hui Yue is like an adoptive child of my family.&quot; Rong Liang laughed as his words resounded throughout the entire room, and somehow it sounded like a threat. Even while Hui Yue and Xiao Ning had been chatting, people were still murmuring softly, but now no one said a word. Everyone was focused on the two City Lords and the young man who had just become a Saint. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I... I see.&quot; The City Lord of Muchuan City said with a squeak before he turned to leave. Rong Liang looked at everyone sweeping his gaze over everyone who looked like frightened rabbits. Seeing this, every single one of them looked away to chat with whomever was closest to them.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I assume you are curious as to why they treat me this way.&quot; Rong Liang said while chuckling, and Hui Yue could not help but nod while frowning. The fox on his shoulder had constantly been watching Rong Liang. Her claws were embedded in Hui Yue&apos;s shoulder, and she looked at the older man with hostility. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I have another job other than just being the City Lord of Riluo City.&quot; He admitted with a smile on his face. &quot;After I became a Saint, it has been my job to enlighten new Saints about the truth of this world.&quot; He said mysteriously, causing Hui Yue to be curious. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;My job is to tell the Saints that although they are strong in our world, there is a world beyond. A world where Gods reign supreme.&quot; Rong Liang spoke as if Hui Yue had never before heard about Gods and the other worlds, and he understood that this was because the Rong twins had never told Rong Liang about his life. Rong Liang simply had no knowledge of Lan Feng and he was also completely unaware of Hui Yue&#x2019;s grudge against An He.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The Saint rank is not the highest rank you can reach. After reaching the Saint rank a new world will open up for you, and it is my job to tell every new Saint about this.&quot; Rong Liang said seriously as he looked at Hui Yue. &quot;Just like every rank before it, Gods are also ranked. The first rank is the Primordial Immortal stage followed by Immortals of Creation. After passing these two ranks, you will reach the rank of Sovereign. This is the highest rank you can reach by cultivating. However, it is also possible to become a Crowned Sovereign. To achieve such a feat, you need to have the support of one of the top ten thousand worlds behind you.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Our world has a ruler, much like every other world.&quot; Rong Liang continued his explanation. &quot;The ruler of our world is known as Master An He. An He is not around often, and figures such as us are incapable of meeting such an exalted person, but since our world is one of the top ten thousand worlds, we are actually strong enough to have a Crowned Sovereign led us!&quot; Rong Liang&apos;s face shone with pride, and he did not even notice Hui Yue&apos;s expressions.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I know that this is really quite a lot of new information for you,&quot; Rong Liang continued, &quot;but it is something every Saint is told.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you for telling me about this.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile on his face, his true feelings completely masked. &quot;Please, stay and enjoy some of the delicacies.&quot; He urged and Rong Liang nodded his head before he left the young man&apos;s side and headed towards a table nearby.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The moment Rong Liang stepped away, everyone rushed to greet him. It was clear that his rank was quite high, even amongst the many Saints present, and Hui Yue could not help but be quite confused. Rong Liang should not have been a Saint for very long so for everyone to know him and treat him with such respect, confused him. How could these people know that Rong Liang was in charge of this information? They had been Saints for much longer than him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Shaking his head, Hui Yue stopped thinking about it and smiled as he went towards Rong Ming and Rong Xing. &quot;How are you doing?&quot; He asked curiously as he saw his two very first friends and his heart went warm. These two siblings were very important to the white-haired young man, and he was happy to chat with them for a long time.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as Rong Liang had left, Huli started acting much nicer. She no longer dug her claws into Hui Yue&apos;s shoulders, nor was she growling at people constantly either. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Instead, she was curiously moving back and forth on top of his shoulder, proudly looking all around. She left Hui Yue wondering if she would fall, and eventually she did. She had been too eager and slipped down from the shoulder, but Hui Yue managed to catch her. The fox then decided to just lay in his warm embrace instead.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;This was the beast you found in the grave?&quot; Rong Xing asked curiously as she looked at the fox. Huli had spent the majority of her time within Hui Yue&apos;s room, never really leaving. Although Rong Xing had seen her once before, it was a very long time ago. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;That&apos;s her.&quot; Hui Yue smiled as he gently petted the soft fur with his hands. &quot;I was surprised to see your father here.&quot; He said while looking around and noticed that Rong Liang was still surrounded by a group of patriarchs. The many people who had come to meet Hui Yue and show him respect no longer seemed to be here for the sake of Hui Yue but rather to give face to Rong Liang. Chuckling, Hui Yue could not help but find it rather amusing.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;It&#x2019;s quite a coincidence.&quot; Rong Ming said with a smile. &quot;Father has never actually visited us before, but this time he actually happened to come visit just as you became a Saint. Not only that, we kinda heard that he had something important to speak with you about. It&#x2019;s such a coincidence.&quot; Frowning, Hui Yue nodded his head. It was indeed quite the coincidence, but after thinking about it for some time, he could not deny that this new responsibility of Rong Liang&#x2019;s probably also came with it some power which helped him know when and where a person became a Saint. If there were not a power like that, then it would be impossible to inform all the Saints about the higher ranks.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
