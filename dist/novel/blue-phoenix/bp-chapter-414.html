A pill like this is inconceivable! How can it be possible?! If such a pill emerges the entire world will be thrown into turmoil; everyone will want the pill formula! People will hunt you down day and night for this pill! What do you plan on doing with it?&quot; Wang Ju Long was shocked to the core, unable to believe that the pill had such an outstanding effect.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I have only made two pills; one is for Jo, and the other is for Lao. I do not plan on making others unless I am forced to take out the formula during the the alchemist&#x2019;s contest. Hopefully, I can avoid offending people, and with my backing, I should be able to withstand the people who would want to hunt me down, not to mention my own strength has increased quite a bit over the past few days.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking at him with worried eyes, Wang Ju Long could not help but worry. &quot;Promise me that you won&#x2019;t use this formula unless it is necessary.&quot; She urged causing a warmth to spread through Hui Yue&apos;s body.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I promise I won&apos;t use it unless there is no other way to win.&quot; He said solemnly, &quot;But you need to understand that I will win this contest. I will do anything to save Sha Yun.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Saying no more, Wang Ju Long just nodded her head as she inwardly hoped that he would not have to put himself in danger for the sake of getting the snake-woman back.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue smiled gently to Wang Ju Long but said nothing more before his focus once more moved to Lao and Jo, the two stunned children who were both staring with shock at the pills in their hands. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Are you certain that these pills can be used by people like us?&quot; He asked with a quivering voice. After having cultivated, he knew that he would be able to reach the King rank and most likely go all the way to become a Saint, but he knew that Jo&apos;s talent was average. To be gifted a pill like this, Jo would never again be bullied by others. She would be capable of looking after herself; something that truly mattered to Lao. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You two are my children.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile on his mouth. &quot;Who else could I possibly give these pills to?&quot; He asked, and Lao was taken by surprise. It was true, who else other than them could he possibly gift the pills to? </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;In that case, thank you very much!&quot; Lao&apos;s eyes were filled with excitement, both for himself and for Jo. A child, Jo&apos;s age, being a King ranked expert was simply impossible, yet here they were, ready to become King ranked experts.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Lao, who was already considered an expert at the academy, could not help but smile. He wondered how his friends would react when he became a King ranked expert, but he was also aware that these pills were never allowed to become known. They were treasures more important than any other in this world. Although they were considered normal in the heavenly worlds, there were far too important in worlds such as theirs.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Lao and Jo, both of you absorb the pill while Ju Long and I stand guard. I am unaware of how powerful the energy ripples released will be, but I am quite certain that the entire city will notice that something has happened.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;If we get guests, tell them that I am training in seclusion and that the energy waves are coming from my room. Do not go into details about anything and try to shoo them away as soon as possible. Have Cai Jie stationed right outside this door and ensure that no one enters.&quot; Hui Yue ordered, and Wang Ju Long nodded her head solemnly before she left the room, leaving only the two children and Hui Yue behind.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Both Lao and Jo were incredibly respectful towards Hui Yue, and neither of them knew exactly how to act while being alone with them. Lao had matured so much during his time looking after Jo and could therefore no longer act like an excited child. His eyes showed a maturity which did not suit his appearance.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Jo, on the other hand, had been allowed to keep her childishness, yet in front of Hui Yue she was always cautious and trying to be on her best behavior. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Sighing internally, Hui Yue wished that the relationship between the three of them would soften, but he also knew that this would be hard to accomplish.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;There is one thing.... When you become Kings, your aging process will become very slow.&quot; Hui Yue suddenly remarked. &quot;I guess you will be children for a very long time.&quot; He casually said, and his words caused both Lao and Jo to be stumped for words. But they soon nodded their heads seriously. Being a King ranked expert, they would be able to easily live for a thousand years. With such a slow aging process, they would indeed be children for a long time.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;It does not matter. If anything then people will underestimate me.&quot; Lao said with a wry smile on his face. &quot;I will gladly accept being a child forever if I have to. To be useful to you is all that matters.&quot; Lao said with heartfelt emotions; his eyes shone with determination, and his hand was clenched around the pill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing this determination, Hui Yue felt grateful and patted the young person on the head. &quot;You need to focus on your cultivation. When you become an Emperor, you can start traveling with me.&quot; He promised. Hearing this promise, Lao&apos;s entire expression turned into a smile.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Now both of you sit on the floor in the lotus position.&quot; Hui Yue said, and they sat down, following his instructions. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Take the pill and let the energy rush through your bodies. It might be a little painful as it will forcefully change your body and unlock two dantians at once. Even if it is painful, please hang on; the longer you hold out, the stronger you will become. Only those who hold out until the bitter end will become King ranked experts.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;This will be easier for you, Lao, than it will be for your sister. You already have your middle dantian unlocked while she does not.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Contemplating for some time, Hui Yue looked at Jo uncertain if he could somehow help her.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&apos;The energy is rough and impossible for a child to control which is why they are in such pain while absorbing the energy .&apos; Lan Feng said, considering their options as well. &apos;We can try taming the energy by using your cloud. I think I know how to do it.&apos; Lan Feng said while thinking out loud and Hui Yue was surprised but also pleased.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&apos;I will leave it to you in that case.&apos; Hui Yue said with a nod. Focusing on the two children Hui Yue sighed deeply. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Lao, Jo, I am going to tell you a very important secret, and you can never tell anyone else about it.&quot; He said gently as he looked into the eyes of the two children, both of them noded their heads and looked at Hui Yue with big, curious eyes.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Inside of me lives a supreme expert.&quot; Hui Yue started, his voice was serious and although both Lao and Jo felt that such a thing should be impossible, neither of them voiced their doubts. &quot;This expert is the reason that I can fight Saints. He has been with me my entire life, and I view him as my brother.&quot; Hui Yue continued to explain as he looked at the two children. &quot;He will come forward and help Jo get through the process of refining the energy. Don&apos;t worry, nothing bad will happen. If anything she will get a lot stronger a lot quicker.&quot; Hui Yue promised, and although Lao was slightly worried, he ended up nodding his head. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;If it can help Jo, then let&#x2019;s do it!&quot; Lao said determined, and since Lao had made a decision, Jo did not question it either.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue closed his eyes a moment; however, the second he opened his eyes again, a completely new aura was coming from him. It was clear that he had changed from being Hui Yue to becoming the hidden expert.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Hello there, young ones.&quot; A deeper and more profound voice suddenly sounded out, causing both kids to jolt in shock. The atmosphere had changed, and the two children felt worried as this was a person they had never met before.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Ah right.&quot; Lan Feng said as he instantly drew back his aura, ensuring that it was not there to frighten the two children anymore.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You can call me uncle Feng; I am your father&apos;s best friend.&quot; He bragged, but his bragging was true. Lan Feng and Hui Yue had been inseparable for so long that they had truly become the best of friends.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Standing up, Lan Feng moved behind Jo and sat down in lotus position himself. He then placed his hands on Jo&apos;s back and sighed heavily. &quot;Okay children take the pill and start focusing on absorbing as much energy as absolutely possible.&quot; Looking at Lao, a look of pity could be seen within his eyes.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Young Lao, I can only help Jo overcome the pain, I cannot help you. I know you are determined, but you are also young. Please do your best, but don&#x2019;t push yourself too hard as it might ruin you instead of helping you.&quot; Lan Feng warned, but Lao just smiled at him and nodded his head. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Thinking back on everything he had gone through in his life, about how he and Jo had been taken in and given a chance and how even now they had been gifted a wonderful medicinal pill the likes of which the world had never seen before caused Lao to be even more resolute. All this went through his mind as he placed the pill in his mouth and closed his eyes.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing the determination in the eyes that just closed, Lan Feng nodded his head with satisfaction. &apos;Taking in this child could prove to be the best decision you ever made.&apos; Lan Feng said to Hui Yue, and the young man currently within the lower dantian could only agree. Lao had so much talent that he could very well turn into Hui Yue&apos;s secret weapon. Who would ever believe that such a young child was a King ranked expert?</span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing Lao pop the pill into his mouth, Jo instantly mimicked his actions. Lan Feng pressed his hands against her back and allowed for the blue cloud to enter her body. The energy had already started appearing the moment it came into contact with their mouths, and these waves of energy were so powerful that they could be seen with the naked eye. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;This will be harder than I thought.&quot; Lan Feng commented and focused fully on pouring the blue cloud energy into Jo&apos;s small body. He surrounded the pill that had entered her throat with the blue cloud and filtered all the energy ensuring that not too much was released at a time. If it had been allowed to freely emit its energy the crashing energy waves and the pain would be too much for the young girl to handle. However, with Lan Feng&apos;s help, it would be possible.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking behind him, Lan Feng noticed that the same powerful waves of energy were crashing within Lao&apos;s body; however, he had no one to help filter this energy and thus his forehead was filled with beads of sweat. His teeth were grinding against each other, and his hands were clenched so hard that blood was dripping from his palm. It was not easy to absorb the energy of Silvermoon&apos;s Pill.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
