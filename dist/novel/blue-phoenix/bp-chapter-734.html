No one was insane enough to try and rush towards Hui Yue to gain whatever treasure he had luckily obtained.</p><p>Since this was the case, Hui Yue continued forward undisturbed. Just as he passed another three fractures, and they were getting smaller and smaller, he noticed that some of the experts were heading towards him.</p><p>Their speed was slow, but the determination in their eyes was easy to see, and seeing them, Hui Yue snorted. He had not killed them because all they had done was show greed, and they were all humans, but Hui Yue was no merciful soul. If these experts truly planned on attacking him, then he did not mind instantly reducing them to nothing, not even leaving ashes behind of their corpses.</p><p>Normally these experts would have been able to see Hui Yue&apos;s cultivation base, however, right now he was relying on the drop of blood from within his core.</p><p>This drop of blood was fairly weak compared to Hui Yue&#x2019;s strength, and his cultivation base had become obscure. For this reason, it was simply impossible to make out his cultivation base, and these humans had long since been blinded by greed. They had not even considered their abilities to wrest away his treasures.</p><p>Snorting, Hui Yue completely ignored them as he closed his eyes and spread out his soulforce once more. He was unable to see the tiniest cracks in space, and he knew that if he just randomly walked where it seemed safe, then he was going to lose at least a leg if not his life.</p><p>With the help of his soulforce, he managed to pass a few more cracks before he suddenly heard a heart-rending scream. His eyes opened, his eyebrow rose, and he looked around him.</p><p>One of the experts that had rushed towards Hui Yue had fallen into one of these invisible tears in space. He had walked straight into it, and his body was being corroded by the second.</p><p>The crack had hit his leg, but with a speed as fast as the eye could see, flesh and blood started to fall off in pieces before it turned to nothingness. Not even his clothes or storage treasures were saved as everything vanished completely.</p><p>This was the result of walking straight into a space tear. There would be nothing left for anyone to see. However, those remnant body parts that Hui Yue had seen before were from getting too close to the cracks, yet not touching them. Although the aura was enough to kill, it was not enough to fully disintegrate the bodies and their belongings.</p><p>Everyone present, including Hui Yue, felt a chill run down their spine. They knew that it was lethal to walk into a space crack, but it was one thing to know and quite another to actually witness it.</p><p>Not only this, while Hui Yue was capable of locating the invisible fractures by relying on his formidable soulforce, the others did not have this benefit. It was not before now they realized that there were cracks in the space in front of them that they could not see and their backs were drenched in a cold sweat.</p><p>&quot;Idiots,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself. He had already told them that there was nothing in the core of this spiderweb-like maze of space cracks, but no one seemed to believe him.</p><p>It was indeed true that beasts would die for food while cultivators would die for wealth.</p><p>This was in every way a suicidal mission no matter how one looked at it, but still, a handful of experts had attempted to enter, and this was only counting this area... Who knew how many were trying to enter from the surrounding areas.</p><p>There were also many experts who had not entered but were standing outside looking at those who were inside. These experts were also quite curious about Hui Yue. On what basis was he capable of telling everyone that they were idiots? How had he managed to get as far as he had without dying? One should know that at least a handful of experts had already died in this maze.</p><p>&quot;Everyone he is coming out. He must have gotten some priceless treasure within the core of this maze to have assisted him in escaping!&quot; someone called, and the others nodded their head in agreement.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x2019;s band together and take his things; then we can decide afterward how to split the items amongst ourselves. We need more than a few people to deal with him as he might have protective treasures, but even if he is strong, he cannot be strong to an unbelievable degree,&quot; another one said with a sinister smile on his face.</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads, some more hesitantly than others but all of them were blinded by their greed. They all wished to get their hands on a heavenly treasure even if it meant that everyone would engage in a bloody battle afterwards.</p><p>The ones in the maze were dejected. They knew that they would have to leave the maze, but now that they knew that there were invisible spatial fractures all around them they were frozen stiff.</p><p>They also knew that they had no chance of leaving before the battle had ended. Thus had no chance of getting the treasure. Thinking of all of this, they felt like giving up and forfeiting their lives right away.</p><p>&quot;I am warning you all,&quot; Hui Yue said with a dangerously low voice. &quot;Do not push me. I am not willing to kill fellow humans now that we are in the middle of a war against the demons, but if it comes down to either you or me, then the answer is obvious.&quot;</p><p>Hearing his threatening words many snorted with disdain. For the ones who were the least affected by the allure of this so-called heavenly treasure, the ones that they did not even know for sure if existed or not, the thought of his words caused their hearts to waver. Some of them even left instantly.</p><p>Hui Yue might not currently have the overwhelming air of a supreme expert, but his cultivation was impossible to see through.</p><p>Not only this, but he had some sort of ability to avoid the space fractures. He had managed to emerge from the inner area of this maze proving that he was no normal cultivator. Anyone who was not blinded by greed left, some hesitantly others instantly.</p><p>Hui Yue did not care about these weak experts, he simply did not put them in his eyes, and while many thought it was because he disdained them, which he did, but mainly it was because he simply could not be bothered with them. A casual wave of his hands would kill them for good, not even allowing for their souls to escape.</p><p>Everyone held their breath. The ones that had entered into the maze slowly and steadily tried to retreat while Hui Yue walked past one tear after another. His soulforce guided him, and he made it look like a game where one&apos;s life was not in danger.</p><p>No one dared speak. Those that had remained were all filled with greed towards the item which was likely letting Hui Yue move through this chaotic space with such ease.</p><p>One lucky chance never came alone, and it was obvious that Hui Yue had been incredibly lucky this time, and who knew which other lucky chances and wonderful encounters he had had in the past.</p><p>As everyone started to think about it, they were almost salivating as they dreamt about how after getting this treasure their wealth would skyrocket.</p><p>A few were getting restless and worried. Hui Yue&apos;s carefreeness and constant advancement towards the end of the maze showed that he had something to back his words. It was not just blind confidence in himself.</p><p>Slowly as Hui Yue moved closer to the edges, more and more people felt unsure and left, but there was a handful who were not willing to give up. It was akin to when you mount a tiger; it is impossible to get off once you have started therefore one just has to hang on and hope for the best.</p><p>These experts were currently feeling this way. They felt that they had no choice other than to seem tough, especially the ones who had spoken up and tried to rally the others into attacking Hui Yue. This was despite the fact that only half of the original amount of people were left.</p><p>&quot;Look how many we have!&quot; someone finally called out when another expert snuck away. &quot;We outnumber him by a lot; we can kill him with a single attack! His wealth will be ours, and now there are even fewer people to share with!&quot;</p><p>This particular individual was completely certain in what he said. He did not doubt that what he spoke was the truth, and he was already rubbing his hands together thinking about all the money he was about to earn.</p><p>At that moment Hui Yue finally left the area of space that was chaotic and safely made it past all the spatial fractures. He opened his eyes, and he heaved a heavy sigh of relief.</p><p>He had been worried sick, not because of the many people who were gathered to deal with him, but because of the danger of fractures.</p><p>Now that he was out his eyes flashed with a dangerous light as he saw how this group of experts all inching closer towards him.</p><p>&quot;Give us your valuables, and we&apos;ll let you leave alive,&quot; one of them said with a gruff voice, but Hui Yue could not help but laugh.</p><p>&quot;Did you not hear what I said?&quot; he asked, but although he had laughed there was a calmness in his voice that made the weaker cultivators flinch.</p><p>&quot;There is no treasure. There was a battle between supreme experts which fractured the space of the surrounding region.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Look around; if there really was a peerless treasure here, do you really think it is your turn to get it? Every major family already knows what has happened here. They have sent experts to explore the area, but they can sense the lack of Ancestral Worldpower in the surroundings. They know that there are no treasures here, leaving all of you to fight over some stupid dream.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue had spoken a lot more than he usually would because they were in the middle of a war, but when he saw that his words only startled a few of the experts and that the others started gathering their daos around them, he sighed and shook his head.</p><p>&quot;I gave you a chance,&quot; he said apologetically while lifting his hand. The dao of fire, wind, darkness, and earth erupted around him. They superimposed on one another, and suddenly the entire atmosphere changed.</p><p>Unfortunately, these experts were slow, and by the time Hui Yue waved his hand a shockwave of energy erupted. It was enhanced by the daos, and the bodies and souls of the advancing experts crumbled.</p><p>Although it seemed different from how the space cracks had killed people, this was just as effective. The moment they were touched, horror filled their eyes and moments after their entire bodies exploded. It was as if the energy within them had been building up and was incapable of vanishing in any other way than to explode out of the body.</p><p>The souls that tried to escape were caught in the shockwave and disintegrated; their energy dissipated into thin air.</p><p>Many of those who had retreated had not retreated far, just far enough to observe what was going to happen, yet when they saw how effortlessly Hui Yue slaughtered them, they all sucked in a cold breath. They were completely filled with fear.</p><p>Had they not felt that something was amiss they would have ended up like these poor souls.</p><p>&quot;They were truly blinded by greed,&quot; Hui Yue sighed and turned to leave. He did not look back, and no one tried to stop him. Everyone looked at his back with reverence. Being the strongest expert, they had seen demanded respect.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
