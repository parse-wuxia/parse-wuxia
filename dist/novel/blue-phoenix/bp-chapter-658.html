Therefore, they could experience leaving a world to the fullest without feeling like disgracing themselves.</p><p>Rong Xing, who had never before left the Divine Beast World, was especially excited and her head kept turning left and right trying to see everything at once.</p><p>Seeing her behave like this, Deng Wu chuckled and flew by her side. He started explaining what everything around her was and its significance.</p><p>&quot;To leave the world is quite simple,&quot; he explained. &quot;We just need to get a little further away from Youdu and then we will start ascending into the heavens.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Every world is covered by some sort of protection, but these protective measures can be broken through by Gods. As soon as we manage to leave the protective barrier, we will then be in space.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In space, one can see multiple worlds, but we will be traveling through the vast void. In the void, one can only travel quickly with special shuttles made for traveling. We have been given amazing shuttles to use by Yanluo, so our journey should not take more than a year until we reach our destination.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In the void, there are plenty of bandits.&quot; Deng Wu continued, &quot;but any bandits that dare to attack us will be in for some pain,&quot; he laughed as he looked at the powerful group of warriors that were in this group of friends.</p><p>&quot;When we are on board the shuttle there is really not much to do, so you should just cultivate. I assume you still have some cultivation resources?&quot; he asked gently, and Rong Xing nodded her head.</p><p>Hui Yue had gifted her plenty of resources such as pills, herbs, and other things which could improve one&#x2019;s cultivation speed, and she was consuming them at a frightening pace.</p><p>Rong Xing was aware that she was weak. She knew that if she wanted to see her brother again, then she needed to have at least a certain amount of strength; therefore, she gave cultivating her all.</p><p>Hui Yue smiled as he saw how everyone was eager to leave the Netherworld, and he could not help but laugh as he saw their curious expressions. They had not dared show too much curiosity before in fear of being rebuked by the Yanluo&#x2019;s Guards, but now they were only with themselves, they looked around everywhere.</p><p>Leaving the world was simple. They all ascended into the heavens until they reached a layer of mist.</p><p>This layer seemed to enter their bodies, but it did not do any damage, and after breathing out a few times it left the body again as if it had never been there in the first place.</p><p>This was the protective layer around the Netherworld. It ensured that the Netherworld was kept in place and that the energy within did not leave and leak into the vast space outside.</p><p>As far as Hui Yue understood the only two purposes this sort of protection had was to ensure that no mortal left the world they belonged to and to ensure that no energy leaked out from within the world.</p><p>Worlds were able to create energy on their own because they had a core formation in the middle of them which created the energy that the cultivators needed, but space was different. There were no formations in space, and thus, it was impossible for it to create energy. Strangely, when one traveled through space, one could still feel that the Ancestral Worldpower was rather dense.</p><p>This was because of nearby collapsing worlds and the worlds which did not yet have complete protection around them.</p><p>Every time a world collapsed, all the energy which was present within the world would enter the void surrounding it and allow for it to spread far and wide.</p><p>This was also why the Archaic World was a place where many of the strongest members of the various top sects would enter. They found that the Ancestral Worldpower in the Archaic World was simply magnificent because of all the collapsing ancient worlds, and at the same time, there was a chance at finding treasures that could change one&#x2019;s destiny. Everyone was tempted by such prospects, but even so, more than half of those who entered died within.</p><p>Hui Yue had long since understood that some sects used the Archaic World as a training ground for their upper-class geniuses. He also understood that the Ancestral Worldpower there was incredibly rich and he knew that treasures were just about everywhere.</p><p>While he knew of all the benefits, he had spent most of his time trying to understand the dangers. Sentient treasures were not going to just allow anyone to pick them up. They would use themselves as a means to fight. Fighting a treasure could be even harder than fighting another cultivator.</p><p>Then there were all the magical beasts. Every single beast within the Archaic World were beasts with ancient bloodlines. This made them fearsome creatures indeed.</p><p>Although the beast Gods that followed Hui Yue were not weak, only a few of them had ancient bloodlines. It was simply too rare to encounter them outside of the Archaic World, and an encounter with such a beast could be even more challenging than meeting five normal beasts of the same level.</p><p>Then there were all the old formations which had been laid down over the various realms. These formations could be used to trap people. They could be made to confuse the experts that entered them. Usually, these types of formations would blind foreign cultivators or even kill them.</p><p>Static formations never vanished. As long as a formation had been placed down, the seals would never vanish, which was what made such a formation fearsome. Only if it was activated and forcefully broken would it vanish. Until then though it would always lie dormant ready to be triggered by an unlucky expert.</p><p>Thinking about all of this, Hui Yue felt a chill in his heart. He knew that he had to protect everyone, but he also knew that he could not always be above them and ensure that they would be safe twenty-four seven.</p><p>Still, he wished to do his best, and as they left the Netherworld and entered the vast void, Hui Yue picked a shuttle and entered the ship-like vessel.</p><p>&quot;I am going to enter closed door meditation,&quot; he said seriously as he looked at them all. He was going to break through to the major dao of wind as soon as possible, and to do that he needed to enter closed door meditation. He was very close, and he knew he would succeed soon.</p><p>&quot;Keep an eye out for bandits,&quot; he ordered as he went towards the downstairs of the ship. &quot;If they don&apos;t attack us, then we won&#x2019;t bother anyone else either.&quot; He gave the final order before vanishing from sight.</p><p>No one dared slack. &quot;I am also going to train!&quot; A few of the experts said whereas others just nodded their heads. Cai Jie, Huli, and Pei Ziqi decided that they did not need to cultivate and instead were the ones who guarded the ship. They kept an eye on what was happening around them and ensured that no one came too close.</p><p>Inside his cabin in the ship-like shuttle, Hui Yue closed his eyes. He and Lan Feng were racing to see who would first complete their major dao. Although it was a race, neither of them were paying any attention to the other. They had to focus their full attention on the daos that they were comprehending.</p><p>Just as Hui Yue felt enlightenment in the dao of the gentle breeze, he suddenly felt a jolt in his soul. It felt as if he had become one with the universe and he was now rapidly absorbing energy from his surroundings.</p><p>Everyone on the entire ship noticed the sudden suction force that came from Hui Yue&apos;s cabin and some were curious about what was going on, while others were certain that he had a breakthrough. No matter who it was, all of them were positively surprised, and everyone was smiling brightly.</p><p>In his cabin, Hui Yue&apos;s face had an awkward expression on it. He was happy, of course, because Lan Feng had just managed to fully comprehend the entire dao of fire, but at the same time, he felt depressed because the advancement and enlightenment he had gained in the dao of wind had just vanished into thin air the moment his soul jolted from suddenly becoming stronger.</p><p>&quot;Heck, you should praise me!&quot; Lan Feng said enthusiastically. He was clearly in a great mood just now as he wandered back and forth within Hui Yue&#x2019;s core.</p><p>&quot;I am a genius! Managing to comprehend a full dao as fast as I did my bloodline is exquisite, and my natural talent is superior.&quot;</p><p>He kept praising himself, and Hui Yue felt like face-palming as he listened to the words that came out this phoenix&apos;s mouth.</p><p>&quot;You are a second generation descendant, and you have been benefitting greatly from the Pills of Clarity that I have consumed,&quot; Hui Yue pointed out.</p><p>Every time he had had a Pill of Clarity, his soul would become much more prone to sensing the dao surrounding him, and the effects were not just on him, but included Lan Feng also since they had a merged soul. If not, how else would it be possible to learn a major dao in just over fifty years?</p><p>&quot;Just say thanks!&quot; Lan Feng laughed. &quot;Thank me for my awesomeness. Thank me for everything I have done for you!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue, smiling, shook his head. &quot;You good for nothing bird,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Of course I am grateful for all you have done for me, but don&apos;t get cocky. I comprehended a major dao before you did,&quot; he was stubborn. His words caused the phoenix to look at him disbelievingly.</p><p>&quot;That did not count!&quot; he exclaimed indignantly. &quot;Merging with your core is not enough to make you claim that you comprehended a dao. You clearly cheated! A cheat I gave you nonetheless! Don&apos;t try to brag in front of me!&quot;</p><p>Hearing the arguments from Lan Feng, Hui Yue said no more, but he could not help but chuckle a little.</p><p>&quot;Well, in that case, thank you, oh great phoenix, for blessing this lowly human with the ability to become a peerless genius!&quot;</p><p>&apos;That&apos;s better!&apos; Lan Feng exclaimed proudly. &apos;Now, return to cultivating. It will be even harder for you to sense the dao of wind now, but if you can completely comprehend it before we reach the Archaic World, our strength will have reached a frightening stage. We would not have to fear the other human cultivators in the Archaic World, and only the formations and fierce beasts will prove to be challenging!&apos;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. Although he wished to chat with Lan Feng, now was not the time. He only had one year to completely comprehend the dao of wind, and he could feel that whenever he reached out to the dao, it was like wind blowing through his fingers. What previously had been easy to feel and comprehend was now slipping away from his reach.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
