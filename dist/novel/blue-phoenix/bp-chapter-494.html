He was not sure how long he had been occupied with the merger of this world into his soul, but now he was sure that it could not have been a brief amount of time because he had experienced the world&#x2019;s history.</p><p dir="ltr">He felt tremendous power surging within his body, and although this power did not belong to him, it was under his complete control. Together with this power, he was also able to feel how the world was feeling. He could feel the emotions of the world, and he was capable of controlling every single piece of land. If he wished to do so, he could use the lifeforce of the world to nourish specific parts of the world and leave others void of energy. He had full control, but he felt that it was best to leave it alone in the case that he messed something up. After all, he wanted to depend on his personal strength instead of the lifeforce of this world.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sorry, it took so long.&quot; Hui Yue sighed as he stood up. Dusting off his clothes he looked around.</p><p dir="ltr">They were no longer inside the volcano. Instead, they were all placed on top of a mountain filled with volcanic ashes and some small red vegetation. Hui Yue felt quite lost because he knew that he had not moved during the entire process, yet now he was somewhere that did not seem even the slightest bit familiar to where he was when he closed his eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. We are in the same place as before.&quot; The bull spoke, and the awe was clear in his voice. &quot;Miss Huli managed to create a pocket dimension which she set up with a great many restrictions and guards that no one will ever be able to enter without your consent. I doubt that even a Heavenly Realm Crowned Sovereign could break into this pocket dimension that she sealed with your blood.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If you reach out you can feel the entrance. Only you and Huli can allow for people to enter this space as the defense is airtight.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Not only this, the Formation of Life has been placed within the world itself. It has been placed deep into the core of this world and has become part of it. The essence of the heavens and the earth will become many times denser, and Ancestral Worldpower will fill the world. Everyone who cultivates on this planet will find their training speed increased many times over. Every person on this planet will become much stronger much faster. Within the next thousand years, I would guess that this Divine Beast World will truly have become a Heavenly Realm.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue could feel the excitement of every single God present, and he nodded his head in approval. It was great that this world was finally on the path to becoming a Heavenly Realm. This was something he had promised the Vermilion Bird he would do, and thus it was clear that he was going to do whatever he could to accomplish it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have no more reason to stay here. Cai Jie is still becoming a God, and it will take him at least a year or two before he finishes. Waiting in this barren land for so long seems pointless.&quot; Hui Yue decided to take up the subject of what to do next.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I need to visit the Frozen General and inform him that we were successful in our endeavor. Right now we do owe him, and I plan on letting him benefit from the formation. Maybe he will be interested in joining us in heading to other worlds later on when he becomes a God. I do not know what his plans are, but he is not hostile towards us as it is and I would feel guilty if I did not repay him for his kindness.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The decision had already been made. Hui Yue had decided that he would allow the Frozen General to enter the Formation of Life. However, he was going to make some preparations so that this person was incapable of finding the formation on his own later on or be able to sell the information to others. Although Hui Yue did not have bad blood with the Frozen General, no one knew what the future would bring or what things might motivate him to sell Hui Yue out.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, we are going to visit the Frozen General and tell him that right now it is not possible for him to enter the Formation of Life, but that I will come and get him when it is his turn to use it.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;After visiting the Frozen General, I would suggest going back to the capital. That is our base and home. It is the place where we have left many of our friends, and we have not seen them for years.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There is no rush for the next many years.&quot; Hui Yue sighed emotionally. He had been rushing day after day to improve his cultivation yet now he was suddenly in no rush to cultivate anymore. He had still not fully understood how to cultivate as a God. Ancestral Worldpower had remade his body and as such how could he improve his energy?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It will take many years before anyone will notice that the rank of our world is climbing, and by then, all of us should already be God ranked cultivators.&quot; Hui Yue calculated, and the others nodded their heads again. Everything he said made sense.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In that case, for the next few years, let&#x2019;s split up.&quot; The Bull said as he voiced the decision of the nine Gods. &quot;We have not been home for so long; we wish to visit Shenyuan and see how many of those old fogeys are still alive. We want to travel again and see the places that we have visited in the past. We want to experience our home again!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who could understand their yearning easily agreed. &quot;Then let us agree to meet up in ten years.&quot; He said. Ten years was a long time, but to someone who had an infinite lifespan, it was not truly something which mattered. Considering that each person would take a few years to become a God, ten years was a very short estimate. Although Hui Yue now had an infinite lifespan, ten years still felt like quite a long time to him.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gods also felt that ten years was a reasonable time for them to once more get used to their world and to deal with unfinished business or catch up with old acquaintances.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have nothing to fear now that you have miss Huli by your side. Her strength is outstanding; she can clearly protect you not to mention, we are within the Divine Beast World. What kind of expert will be hiding here? An He is gone, and any other Gods should also have left long ago. You should be completely safe as long as you do not leave this world of yours.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, understanding what the bull said, nodded his head and stretched. &quot;There is no reason for you to linger here any longer. Ten years from now come to Muchuan City and seek me out; I am sure that you will find it easy to find me.&quot; He laughed, and the nine Gods all nodded their heads.</p><p dir="ltr">Each and every one of them went to say their goodbyes, but the one who took the longest was Xiao She who said her goodbyes to Sha Yun. Those two snake-women both felt as if they had become real sisters and the goodbye was filled with tears.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, the goodbyes were done, and each God turned into streaks of light vanishing to the corners of the world. Seeing the Gods disappearing into the horizon Hui Yue felt mixed emotions.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Looks like we lost our protection.&quot; Hui Yue joked. &quot;But we are back the way we were when we first started our journey. Just us friends. We started this together, and we will end it together.&quot; He said with a gentle smile on his face, and his words caused the others to feel excited.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master.&quot; Huli suddenly appeared out of nowhere and instantly latched onto his arm. A big smile was on her lips, her breasts were pressed against him, and she wiggled happily while looking adorable. Instead of feeling aroused, Hui Yue just felt a headache coming. Still, Huli had done him a great favor with the placement of the Formation of Life, and she needed to be spoiled. Therefore, he gently petted her head in an affectionate manner which made her stand still savoring the affection she was experiencing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You did a good job today.&quot; Hui Yue said praisingly, and she almost purred in happiness. Her face turned red, and it was hard to understand exactly what she was thinking.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Gently removing his arm, Hui Yue managed to release himself from her tight grip and felt relieved.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will be setting out tomorrow.&quot; He decided. Their trip would be much slower now that they did not have the Gods to help them fly. If Hui Yue tried to transport them using his Ancestral Worldpower, he was likely to use up all the energy he possessed within a rather short period.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As such, their only other option was to slowly move forward, but no one seemed to mind this. This was the way they had traveled before, and they also had ten years of time to waste before they left this plane. During these ten years, although they could increase their strength, there was not much else for them to do. Spending a year to return to Muchuan City was already acceptable.</p><p dir="ltr">The reason that Hui Yue had chosen to wait a full day before heading out was that he was unaware of how much energy Huli had used. He feared that even if he asked her, she would not be honest for the sake of not troubling him. In such a situation it was better to just make the decision and go with it. If Huli did not need the break, then Hui Yue could use it. He was not feeling physically exhausted, but mentally he had been pushed to his limits while merging with the Divine Beast World.</p><p dir="ltr">Lao and Jo spent the rest of the day playing with Huli in her fox form while Hui Yue relaxed with Wang Ju Long and Sha Yun. Deng Wu was busy examining the surroundings, and in this way, the day quickly passed. As night descended, they had hunted down a beast and were roasting it while eating together and chatting about the future. All of them were excited about traveling through the void and entering other worlds, experiencing other cultures, and were excited to see how they cultivated.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as morning broke, they set out. They left the red mountains and went towards the location where the Frozen General lived. They left behind the scorching hot mountains with volcanoes everywhere and entered the Magical Forest once more.</p><p dir="ltr">This time they were many times more alert than they had been before. There was no longer a surplus of Gods. Instead, there were now many Saints, and within these deep forests, other Saints were also present. Some of these Saint beasts had been training for thousands of years, and their cunningness could not be described. If these beasts were to team up and attack, Hui Yue&apos;s group was likely to suffer some casualties. Although it would be almost impossible to injure Hui Yue or Huli, they still might manage to kill other Saints with some luck if they were willing to pay a high enough price.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
