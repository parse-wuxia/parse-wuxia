They had been through so much together, and now that they had to embark upon a new adventure they were ready. Although they had just a moment&#x2019;s notice to prepare, none were worried.</p><p>&quot;When will we set out?&quot; Rong Xing asked with a voice so cold that the others shuddered. She was the one most eager to leave. She followed Hui Yue because they were friends, but of all Hui Yue&apos;s friends, apart from Lan Feng and Little Dragon, she was the one who was most eager to find An He.</p><p>Her feelings for An He were filled with hatred. She hated the man who had made her father go against Hui Yue. She did not blame her father; she blamed An He who was behind it all.</p><p>Truthfully, she was not able to hate her father at all. At the same time, she was not able to choose Hui Yue above her father either. Although Hui Yue was like family to her, her father was her real family, and she had been doted upon for so many years that it was impossible to not be impartial.</p><p>What really infuriated her was that Rong Ming had been forced to go with Rong Liang. Although she loved her father, the most important person to her was her twin brother. She had been with him for so many years, and she would do anything to be together with him again.</p><p>Another reason that she had not said anything about being with Hui Yue was Deng Wu. Deng Wu and her were good friends for many years, and as time had progressed so had their relationship.</p><p>Especially after becoming immortals. Deng Wu had been chasing after her for many many years now, but after becoming immortals, Rong Xing, who had been alone after the separation of her and Rong Ming, felt fragile and weak and having Deng Wu by her side helped her feel much better.</p><p>Rong Xing was eager to find and kill An He because she hoped that it would allow for her to reunite with Rong Ming, but she still had no idea what she would do when she reunited with her father.</p><p>She could not just watch him being killed by her good friends, but at the same time, she could not bear for her friends to come to harm because of her father either. It was truly a tough predicament.</p><p>&quot;We will be leaving as soon as the others arrive from the guardian sects,&quot; Hui Yue said seriously. He was aware of Rong Xing&apos;s emotions and thoughts on the matter, but he said nothing about it. He could not promise that he would let Rong Liang go after what he did to Wang Ju Long, nor was he willing to let one of An He&apos;s strongest generals reign free if he could be eliminated.</p><p>The room lapsed into silence as everyone thought about what Hui Yue had said. Some, like Little Dragon and Deng Wu, were thinking about Rong Xing and her situation, while others were thinking about the dangers they were about to approach.</p><p>&quot;I still have not told the ones from the Celestial Sword Sect about my plans. As soon as we finish here I will be going to talk with my father and the patriarch,&quot; Hui Yue said. It did not come as a surprise that the first people he spoke with were his friends. He had always valued friendship highly, and they were the ones who would be joining him. If they had spoken against it, then likely the trip would have been canceled.</p><p>But no one seemed to be against it if anything they were all excited for their own purposes. Everyone wished to kill An He as soon as possible. He was an obstacle that had been in their way for a great many years now, and some of them had been his enemy for thousands of years already.</p><p>Lan Feng was eager to head out. He knew that with his and Hui Yue&apos;s current strength they ranked amongst the upper echelons of the galaxy&apos;s cultivators, and if they fought together, it would be very hard for anyone else to flee from them.</p><p>&quot;If that is all, then I suggest that we start preparing as soon as possible,&quot; Huli said. She was as sensible as always and started planning ahead. &quot;We will have to stock up on everything we might need. Although we will be traveling through the civilized world this time, it&#x2019;s hard to say for certain that we will be able to find the things we need. Therefore, It is better to bring our own essentials with us.&quot;</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads. Although there was nothing they really needed as Gods, there were still things that made their lives much more comfortable.</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head and was about to leave when the waitresses appeared with food and drinks. When he saw the food, he could tell that his friends wanted him to stay and relax for a little, and although he was in a hurry to start his search for An He, he could always take time for his friends.</p><p>&quot;How is the married life?&quot; Deng Wu asked with a grin on his face, and Rong Xing gave him an elbow to the side while she, Wang Ju Long, and Sha Yun blushed.</p><p>Huli just grinned at him and hooked her arms around Hui Yue&apos;s making him feel the voluptuous bosom that was hiding beneath the clothes and a grin also appeared on Hui Yue&#x2019;s face. &quot;Life is good,&quot; he said with a nod of his head. &quot;Being married to these three women, how could my life not be amazing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Life as a married man, I heard that some considered it a burden, but if I was married to such beautiful women, and three of them to boot, then I would also be quite blissful,&quot; Wei said with a smile on his face, not letting the two girls any respite.</p><p>&quot;For the next wedding... Do you think it will be Deng Wu and Rong Xing&apos;s or Lan Feng and Xiao She&apos;s?&quot; Little Dragon asked curiously as he rested his head in his hands. He looked completely casual as he spoke but although he seemed as if he had just spoken about the weather, his words caused everyone present to stop with their food halfway in their mouth.</p><p>Rong Xing&apos;s face turned beet red, and she hid her face in Deng Wu&apos;s side. Her previously calm and cold demeanor had completely melted. She had turned back into a small girl who was being teased.</p><p>Xiao She took it differently. She glared at Little Dragon. She and Little Dragon had known each other thousands of years before when the Divine Beasts were in control of the Divine Beast World so although she was embarrassed by his words, she knew his mischievous personality and just glared at him.</p><p>Nobody had been surprised by his words, as they had gotten friendly with Little Dragon on their trip from the Archaic World, and they had gotten to know what he was like. They all knew he meant no harm with what he said; he genuinely just wanted them to get married and be happy together.</p><p>Little Dragon was very much like a small child. He would say whatever came to his mind, whenever it did. He was an honest and straightforward child.</p><p>Because of his personality, he had become well-liked very fast. Everyone enjoyed their time together with him and Little Dragon had easily become part of the group.</p><p>He and Deng Wu were the best of friends. They had known each other for a long time and had depended on each other for just as long.</p><p>Little Dragon and Deng Wu knew each other by heart, and it was clear that Little Dragon just wanted the best for Deng Wu, which was why he asked when he would get married.</p><p>After getting over their initial surprise at the question, Hui Yue, Wei, and the other girls started laughing out loud, something that they needed to do. After talking about such depressing subjects, it was liberating to laugh out loud and soon everyone was smiling as they enjoyed the meal.</p><p>Everyone had gathered in a hurry. They had been uncomfortable and worried. When they heard Hui Yue&apos;s report, they had been filled with a mixture of excitement and anticipation, but at the same time, everyone was also worried about the danger they would have to face.</p><p>But now, as the day was drawing to a close, Hui Yue, his friends, and family left the restaurant in a great mood. They were no longer in a rush. Although they knew they had to hurry, they could do nothing before Cai Jie, and the other Gods arrived from the Guardian Sects, and since this was the case, they might as well enjoy life.</p><p>Hui Yue returned to the sect with his family after saying goodbye to his friends. He led Sha Yun, Huli, and Wang Ju Long back to the valley.</p><p>&quot;Please get some rest,&quot; he said with a smile on his face as he stroked Wang Ju Long&apos;s cheek, kissed Sha Yun, and squeezed Huli&apos;s hand.</p><p>&quot;What do you need to do?&quot; Sha Yun asked with a sour expression on her face. She wanted Hui Yue to stay with them, but she understood that he too had to prepare for their adventure.</p><p>&quot;I will come back soon,&quot; he promised them as he turned around and left the valley. The three women stayed outside of the house that belonged to Hui Yue and looked on as his shadow vanished into the night.</p><p>The three women sighed collectively before they looked at one another and smiled wryly. &quot;Well, we better get some rest.&quot; Wang Ju Long said with a nod of her head. &quot;We don&apos;t want to become a burden to Yue,&quot; Huli agreed. &quot;I will wait for him,&quot; Sha Yun decided, and both Huli and Wang Ju Long knew that it was pointless to try and deter her, so they just shook their heads and entered the house, going to their rooms where they started cultivating.</p><p>&quot;I heard you left the sect,&quot; Pei Tian smiled as he looked at his son. No matter how he looked at him he had become much stronger than he was before, he was now the pride of not only Pei Tian but the entire Celestial Sword Sect and Pei Tian could not help but feel satisfied.</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Hui Yue responded with a nod of his head, &quot;I am going to leave the Celestial Sword Sect soon,&quot; he said honestly. &quot;The Blood Demons are starting to act, and Yanluo will summon everyone for a meeting to discuss how to deal with them. I will be heading for the areas that they control already and fight the Blood Demons present.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&apos;re searching for this An He guy?&quot; Pei Tian asked with a frown on his face, and Hui Yue nodded. &quot;An He and I cannot coexist. I will kill him one way or another, and now is a great chance to do so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand.&quot; Pei Tian turned silent for a long time before he scratched his head, &quot;Let&#x2019;s go visit your uncle,&quot; he said after thinking for some time. &quot;I know you are using a treasured sword, but I will ask that the sect lend you the Celestial Sword.&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
