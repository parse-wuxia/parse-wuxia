Everywhere they looked, there were experts fighting.</p><p>Some were humans and beasts others were demons. Some of the demons looked like humans with purple eyes some looked like beasts while others looked like half-humans half-beasts.</p><p>At the same time, many of the beasts were forced to take on their original forms to be able to show their full power while fighting.</p><p>The beasts had stronger, bigger bodies than the humans, and thus they were also stronger than a human on the same level unless the human had a refined body.</p><p>The demons which had beastly traits were also stronger than an ordinary human of the same level, but they were overpowered by the beasts that had complete beastly forms.</p><p>Hui Yue, Lan Feng, and Wang Ju Long continued to fight their way through the Blood Demons. They had not encountered any experts of the heavenly dao level yet, all they saw were those Blood Demons who had comprehended major daos, and they were all chopped up one after another.</p><p>No one stood a chance in front of these three monsters that had comprehended heavenly daos. Although they were not going out of their way to fight Blood Demons of lower strength, they did not let anyone go if they were attacked.</p><p>They quickly made their way into the inner regions of the Blood Demon&apos;s army as more and more demons tried to attack them. With every swing of his sword, Hui Yue would slay tens of Blood Demons that were launching attacks at them.</p><p>Wang Ju Long was just as ruthless. Her eyes were completely black, and everywhere she went, cultivators&#x2019; lifeforce was corroded, Blood Demons were aging and slowly dying.</p><p>Lan Feng was using the dao of life in a very similar manner. He was directly stealing lifeforce and keeping it for himself.</p><p>Where Wang Ju Long was corroding the enemy, Lan Feng was harvesting their lives, and only Hui Yue was not currently using the dao, all he was using was the sword.</p><p>Soon a path of corpses had appeared behind Hui Yue, Lan Feng, and Wang Ju Long. The Blood Demons were all bloodthirsty, but they quickly realized that this group was simply too strong. All anyone saw in their wake were corpses falling from the sky as they advanced.</p><p>No one was stupid enough to attack this group, and as a result, they opened up a path for them no matter where they went.</p><p>&quot;To so brazenly infiltrate our army like this, do you some plan or are you just stupid?&quot; a voice sounded from above causing Hui Yue, Lan Feng, and Wang Ju Long to all look up only to see two Blood Demons looking down on them.</p><p>These two Blood Demons were strong, they had comprehended heavenly daos, but they seemed young.</p><p>One of them was wearing a silver mask, but three horns protruded from his forehead, two smaller ones around his temples and one larger one in the middle.</p><p>The mask did not hide his horns, and his purple eyes gleamed menacingly.</p><p>Next to him was a young Blood Demon that looked like a human, except he had a tail. His tail thrashed back and forth reminding Hui Yue of a small dog, and when he saw this, he could not help but almost chuckle.</p><p>Stopping himself in time, his expression looked rather peculiar, and Lan Feng who shared a soul with him sensed his amusement. His eyes landed on the tail, and although Hui Yue had stopped himself from laughing, Lan Feng was not going to do so. He started laughing as he pointed at the tail.</p><p>&quot;Okay, doggie demon, why don&apos;t you tell us why we would dare to enter this army?&quot; Lan Feng laughed, his words causing the Blood Demon&apos;s eyes to seethe with anger. He was about to rush forward when he was stopped by the masked Blood Demon.</p><p>&quot;Who are you calling a dog you disgusting parrot?! You have lost your ability of rebirth, and you still call yourself a phoenix?!&quot; the dog demon yelled out, and when he did the masked Blood Demon&apos;s behavior changed.</p><p>&quot;You can&apos;t keep your mouth shut for a moment can you?!&quot; he exclaimed with anger as he looked at Hui Yue who was thinking about why these two had intercepted them.</p><p>A sinister smile appeared on his lips.</p><p>&quot;I assume you two are blood princes,&quot; he stated, without wanting a reply. Nevertheless, the two Blood Demons nodded their heads in pride, and Hui Yue also nodded his head again. &quot;I can guess that you are here because An He asked you to deal with us before we reached him,&quot; he continued, and the face of the dog demon turned ugly.</p><p>&quot;Do you know how many blood princes have already lost their little lives to our hands?&quot; Lan Feng asked mockingly, and the two Blood Demons turned even angrier than they had been before.</p><p>&quot;It is typical An He, he dares not meet us face to face, so he sends weaker experts to wear us out,&quot; even Wang Ju Long was adding salt to their injury and causing the two Blood Demons to become livid with anger.</p><p>&quot;Naturally, he knows he is no match for us, so the only option he has is to attack us like this,&quot; Hui Yue nodded his head.</p><p>&quot;Hey, hey, hey!&quot; the dog demon exclaimed. &quot;You talk as if you have already defeated us! We might be blood princes, but we are ranked very highly, in the top five! You think that just because you have dealt with the trash of the lower ranks, you can deal with us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, you might not have noticed, but our daos vastly outstrip yours,&quot; Hui Yue said with a friendly voice as he lifted his hand and the dao of life alongside the dao of the heavens started to revolve around him.</p><p>The dao of the heavens was an elusive dao. The heavenly daos were not like the major daos; they did not control an element, instead, they controlled a concept.</p><p>Anyone who wished to cultivate had to gain the acceptance of the daos, they had to merge with the daos to be able to proceed forward on their path of cultivation, and only those who controlled a dao were able to reach unprecedented heights.</p><p>The dao was split into minor daos, major daos, heavenly daos, and the Great Dao.</p><p>The Great Dao was everything. Everything was contained within the Great Dao. When one comprehended the Great Dao, then one would have comprehended all the daos that existed. At that time one&apos;s soul would reach a whole new level, but the heavenly daos were only a step lower than the Great Dao.</p><p>Having comprehended the heavenly dao of heavens, Hui Yue and Lan Feng were able to smite down any opponent. They could make use of the heavenly tribulation and heaven&#x2019;s laws.</p><p>They were also able to understand and use the pressure from the heavens themselves; they could turn the heavens itself into a deadly weapon.</p><p>The faces of the two blood princes changed slightly as they felt Hui Yue open himself up to the dao. They too had comprehended two heavenly daos which was why they had been chosen for the task.</p><p>An He was aware that Hui Yue and Lan Feng had both comprehended the heavenly daos of life and the heavenly dao of the heavens. He knew about it when he had been informed of it by Zhong Fai while he was commanded by the slave mark, and secondly, he had witnessed it for himself when the battle first began.</p><p>&quot;That bastard, did he really send us here to die?&quot; the dog demon cursed at An He while the masked Blood Demon was quiet for some time.</p><p>&quot;Even if he did, we have no choice,&quot; he sighed. &quot;We are here already. We have to face these humans and beast even if we do not want to. We have verbally spared against them, we have trash talked one another, and we even have our orders from brother An He. We cannot retreat now unless we want to be forever fleeing for our lives.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Should we survive this battle and An He also survives, then we will be forever known as the traitors of the Blood Demons. I would much rather risk my life to fight these three than to die as a traitor!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are so serious,&quot; the dog demon sighed, but his eyes turned serious as well. &quot;I guess you have a point though. We are fighting for our freedom. So what if we lose our lives? It is much better than to be known as traitors!&quot;</p><p>The two Blood Demons both unsheathed their weapons and turned to Hui Yue, Lan Feng, and Wang Ju Long. Their eyes were glistening sinisterly while Hui Yue had a serious expression on his face.</p><p>It was clear that this battle would be serious. Although Hui Yue had the benefit of one more person on his side, he had just recently become a heavenly dao cultivator, and it was even shorter time since he had comprehended the heavenly dao of the heavens.</p><p>He was not familiar with the daos as much as these other experts were, and although he was as strong as them on paper, he might not be as strong in reality.</p><p>Fortunately, Hui Yue had many tricks up his sleeve. He had his previous lives, his refined body, and his heavenly daos.</p><p>He also had more people on his side than they had, so Hui Yue assumed that they would be fine, not to mention their limitless supply of medicinal pills.</p><p>Hui Yue was not fearful as he swung the sword in his hands causing the space around them to be torn asunder. The faces of the Blood Demons changed drastically when they saw that a casual swing of Hui Yue&apos;s sword caused tears in the fabric of reality. It was clear that he was much stronger than they expected.</p><p>At the same time, they also looked at the Celestial Sword with greed. They could easily guess that this sword was not ordinary. They had not been informed of it being the Celestial Sword as An He had not thought it necessary.</p><p>He had, however, promised the two Blood Demons could have all the items belonging to Hui Yue and his friends while telling them that this young man was the legacy apprentice of the Alchemist God.</p><p>The dog demon and his masked friend were eager to take the task because they thought that Hui Yue had only cultivated one heavenly dao, and at the same time had plenty of treasures on him since he was a legacy apprentice of such a heavenly figure.</p><p>Only now did they realize that they had been tricked, but even so, they could not turn back. The dog demon was using metal claw knuckles while the mask-wearing expert was using a spear.</p><p>Both of them were using their weapons and casually annihilated the sword lights that were coming their way.</p><p>Lan Feng&apos;s body swelled as he took the shape of the blue phoenix and Wang Ju Long also brandished her spear, ready to attack together with Hui Yue and Lan Feng.</p><p>She knew that she had to be careful since she was the weakest, but she refused to give up. She would assist Hui Yue as much as she possibly could!</p><p>Soon swordlight collided with spearlight, claws of the phoenix and his beak crossed with the claws of the dog demon, and Wang Ju Long, who stayed at the back, was constantly throwing spearlight towards the two Blood Demons making things difficult for them.</p><p>At the same time, she killed any Blood Demon that came close to them. That is every Blood Demon that was not already killed by the shockwaves of the battle that was unfolding in the middle of the Blood Demon&#x2019;s army.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
