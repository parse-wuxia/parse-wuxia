He spent his life with Huli, and everything after was similar to how Huli had described their time together.</p><p>Although Hui Yue felt as if a whole lifetime had gone by, the truth was that only a few seconds had come to pass. To everyone else, it looked as if he had stopped in his tracks and blinked. As Hui Yue opened his eyes, he saw that everyone was staring at him with confusion, and at the same time, he felt the major dao of darkness surrounding him.</p><p>He now had access to four major daos: the major dao of earth, wind, fire, and darkness, and his strength was soaring as he stood there looking at the three women in front of him. The dao of darkness in the surrounding area flooded into his body, and he absorbed it greedily.</p><p>&quot;What&#x2019;s happening?&quot; someone asked shocked, and the others who noticed were also stunned. No one, apart from Yanluo who knew about Hui Yue&apos;s situation and Hui Yue&apos;s good friends, had any idea what was going on.</p><p>Hui Yue absorbed the dao of darkness and felt how it became one with his soul, became a part of him, he felt how the thousands of minor daos that he could not control were all comprehended, and he now knew the various attacks and skill that he had made in his previous life.</p><p>&quot;He got much stronger all of a sudden!&quot; someone exclaimed, and the others finally understood what was happening. &quot;He is comprehending another major dao!&quot; someone exclaimed, and everyone was shocked speechless.</p><p>They all knew how young Hui Yue was, but they also understood that only a handful of experts in the entire galaxy could hold a candle to him.</p><p>&quot;I apologize,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile on his face as he swept his eyes across the shocked crowd in front of him. &quot;I will continue with the wedding now. I had a sudden enlightenment, and I was unable to push it aside,&quot; he continued. He smiled once more and led the girls towards the platform again.</p><p>Moving towards the platform, flower petals fell from the roof and landed on top of them and on the path they were walking down.</p><p>As they reached the platform, Hui Yue helped all three of them up to the top of the platform and followed behind them.</p><p>The three women stood on one side with Hui Yue on the other.</p><p>&quot;I vow to the heavens and the earth to cherish you for the rest of my life. I vow to protect you from harm, guard you in troubled times, and look for you in our happy moments. I promise to listen, to hear, and to always consider your feelings and thoughts as we travel together on our journey. I promise to be your faithful husband. I promise to love you when the sun shines, when the rain falls, in sickness, and in health. When you think of this vow, think of me and remember that I will always love you. This I vow.&quot;</p><p>His words were filled with emotions. They were filled with love and affection, and every word caused the three women to cry. Silent tears ran down their cheeks that were hidden beneath veils of red, transparent silk, and everyone could sense how deep their love for one another was and how happy the vow made these women.</p><p>Huli took a step forward and placed her hands on top of Hui Yue&apos;s. She cleared her throat before she started speaking, &quot;I promise to love and care for you, and I will try in every way to be worthy of your love. I will always be honest with you, kind, patient, and forgiving. You are my lover and my teacher. You are my model and my accomplice, and you are my true counterpart. I will love you, hold you, and honor you; I will respect you, encourage you, and cherish you. In health and sickness, through sorrow and success, for all the days of my life.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s heart was beating rapidly as he heard Huli say her vow with a very solemn and serious voice. Her face was masked by the veil, but even so, Hui Yue knew that she was crying silently, crying in joy.</p><p>After having relived his previous life&apos;s memory, his feelings for Huli had skyrocketed. He had already loved her dearly, but now these feelings were even more profound. She was a very important person to him, a person who had shown him the light in his darkest moments, and he wished for her to be happy.</p><p>Hearing her emotional, but serious, voice, Hui Yue knew that this was the happiest she had been since the time they had spent together on her home planet.</p><p>As Huli finished her vow, a stream of light shone down from a hole in the ceiling. It surrounded Hui Yue and Huli and bound them together for all eternity. Although their souls were not merged like Hui Yue and Lan Feng&apos;s were, they were still connected and would be for the rest of their lives. A vow of marriage for a God was no simple thing.</p><p>No one said a word when they saw the light shine down through the ceiling. Most of the cultivators present were smiling happily, and a few even had tears in their eyes, but a minority of them were frowning.</p><p>Everyone knew some basic knowledge about Huli and Hui Yue. They knew that Hui Yue was many times younger than Huli, so how could he be her teacher?</p><p>Only a few knew the real history between Hui Yue and Huli, and they were smiling happily for the two experts. To see them tie the knot and finally say their wedding vows, they only felt happiness.</p><p>As Huli finished her vow, the stream of light vanished, and Huli retreated a few steps. Sha Yun stepped forward and placed her hands on Hui Yue&apos;s as she spoke her vow in a clear voice.</p><p>&quot;I promise to cherish each day more than the day before and to face any obstacles headfirst knowing we will face them as a team. Our lives will be richer every moment we experience together.&quot;</p><p>Sha Yun&apos;s vow was straightforward. Halfway through, although her voice was clear, it suddenly faltered, and she needed a break to finish speaking. It was clear that she had wanted to say something more, but her voice would not follow her command. While she was trying to force out the last few words, the light from the sky did not wait for her. It descended down through the ceiling, surrounding Hui Yue and Sha Yun binding them together.</p><p>When she finished, Wang Ju Long was supposed to speak her vows, but she hesitated slightly. Only after some time did she step forward and placed her hand on top of Hui Yue&apos;s hand. Her voice trembled from the start and it was quite low, but everyone was silent so even though it was low and trembling, everyone could hear what she said.</p><p>&quot;You have been my best friend, mentor, playmate, confidant, and my greatest challenge, but most importantly, you are the love of my life. You make me happier than I could have ever imagined and make me feel more loved than I ever thought possible. You have made me a better person and our love for one another is reflected in the way I live my life. I am truly blessed to be apart of your life, which as of today becomes our life together.&quot;</p><p>Once again the light shone, and for the third and last time of the ceremony, it connected Wang Ju Long with Hui Yue.</p><p>As he finished, Hui Yue took a step forward and lifted the veil that covered the faces of the three women. He started with Huli, then he went to Sha Yun, and finally Wang Ju Long.</p><p>Seeing those three women and the unconditional love in their eyes, Hui Yue&apos;s own heart was throbbing and swelling with pride and happiness. From now on these three women were his, they were his wives. It was now official, and the whole galaxy knew about it.</p><p>As the ceremony finished and the veils were lifted, a ground-shaking cheer resounded through the entire hall shaking the hall they were in. Everyone joined in cheering on them wishing to be the first to congratulate the happy lovers.</p><p>Hui Yue led the three girls down from the platform and started to mingle with the many people on the ground. Everyone wished to introduce themselves, but only a few people could introduce themselves at a time.</p><p>Right now, Hui Yue understood that everyone wanted to congratulate him, so he did not stay behind to chat with people, instead, he went passed everyone to allow them to wish him and his wives well.</p><p>It took them a full seven hours to walk through and allow for all of them to greet them, and only after this did they allow for Hui Yue to take a deep breath and regain his composure.</p><p>The three women were smiling, but they were also tired. It had been an emotional rollercoaster for them, but they were incredibly happy and proud.</p><p>They had not been expected to speak with the guests, they just followed Hui Yue around. But seeing that Hui Yue was dealing with so many people, they understood if he was getting slightly exhausted.</p><p>&quot;Well, congratulations,&quot; a familiar voice sounded from behind Hui Yue, and as he turned around, he saw the owner of the Blissful Realm.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x2019;t think I introduced myself,&quot; she said smilingly as she stepped forward and shook Hui Yue&apos;s hand. &quot;I am a Crowned Sovereign; my name is Su Xiuying. I was very honored to be invited here to your wedding, and I brought a good present for you. You can find it in the same room with all the presents you have gotten.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue bowed to the lady, &quot;Thank you miss Xiuying,&quot; he said from his heart. He vaguely remembered that she was a Crowned Sovereign, but he was not aware that she would show up at his wedding.</p><p>He spoke a little with Su Xiuying about the latest information related to the Archaic World, and he heard that the frequency of the Ancestral Worldpower tidal waves were increasing causing many to be worried.</p><p>After speaking with Su Xiuying for some time about the Archaic World, Hui Yue excused himself and went in search of the delegation coming from Diyu. He wished to use his wedding as a platform to inform everyone that he was no longer a Judge of Hell and that King Chujiang would be regaining his previous position.</p><p>Just as he was about to move another person came to stop him and chat with him. This time it was someone he had never seen before, but this person was ranked in the middle of the Heavenly Rankings.</p><p>He was eager to befriend Hui Yue and rather pushy, but after talking with him for a moment, he managed to escape.</p><p>Unfortunately, the hall was massive, and it was filled to the brim with Gods.</p><p>Many disciples were walking around with platters of food and drinks, ensuring that the guests were well looked after. Many guests had gathered in groups here and there and were discussing many things.</p><p>The platform, which had been used for the ceremony was being cleaned, and soon it would be used for martial arts debates between the disciples that had been brought with the main sects to the wedding.</p><p>The top experts of the younger generation of the Celestial Sword Sect were also invited to the wedding to participate in these debates.</p><p>Every sect had brought along their strongest disciples, but even so, everyone already knew that the position of the most outstanding youth in the younger generation was the man everyone wished to become friends with, the man who had just married the three stunning women.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
