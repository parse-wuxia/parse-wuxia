If you have a shuttle you will have to pay the fee for entry into our realm!&quot; he exclaimed, but Hui Yue just snorted.</p><p>&quot;You want to look in my storage treasure?&quot; he asked mockingly. This demand was so outrageous that even the other experts watching could not help but snicker.</p><p>Storage treasures typically contained the entire wealth of a cultivator. It was not something they would show to anyone!</p><p>&quot;Hey, hurry up! Let us in!&quot; Someone from the back called as more and more people gathered around the entrance to the small realm.</p><p>&quot;You will be let in when I have been paid by the group in front of me! I need ten Worldpower Stones per person and a thousand stones for the shuttle that was just here!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What shuttle?&quot; another expert suddenly asked, his words causing the others to laugh out loud. Everyone was having fun at the expense of the guard, and the man could not help but grit his teeth in anger.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know who you are, but don&apos;t think you will be getting into our Blissful Realm without paying the entrance fee!&quot; he roared with anger, and Hui Yue, who seemed completely carefree flipped his hand causing a bag to appear. &quot;Here is the fee,&quot; he said casually and threw it towards the guard who caught it in the air.</p><p>The guard felt that something was wrong, and as he scanned the contents of the bag with his consciousness, his face turned sour.</p><p>This was just the standard price that everyone had to pay! His thousand Worldpower Stones for the shuttle were not there.</p><p>&quot;You still owe me a thousand!&quot; he exclaimed loudly. His entire body was shaking from anger. If Hui Yue had been a part of a smaller group he would have already attacked him, but the group in front of him now was in no way small, and many of them were Immortals of Creation. As for how strong they were, this guard did not know, but he was not going to fight such a group by himself.</p><p>&quot;What&#x2019;s going on?&quot; a dignified voice suddenly spoke out of nowhere. Then a young woman with a fan in her hand appeared, looking at Hui Yue and the guards with a frown on her beautiful face.</p><p>Hui Yue took his eyes off the guard and glanced at the woman. She was wearing a tight red dress with golden phoenixes dancing about. Her long hair was braided and tied up on top of her head with two beautiful hairpins sticking out.</p><p>Her skin was as white as newly fallen snow, but her lips were as red as blood. Her eyes were dark like the deepest night, and Hui Yue could immediately sense that this woman was not to be trifled with.</p><p>&quot;Miss Pei,&quot; she said surprised when she looked at Pei Ziqi. &quot;I heard you were no longer an elder in the Celestial Sword Sect but now a dao protector. You have my congratulations. What is a Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s dao protector doing here trying to enter my Blissful Realm?&quot;</p><p>Hearing the woman mention her Blissful Realm, Hui Yue narrowed his eyes. This woman was a Crowned Sovereign and the creator of this Blissful Realm.</p><p>&quot;I am here to look after a young one from our sect,&quot; Pei Ziqi said with a smile. She did not go into details about who this genius was, nor did she mention any names but the lady narrowed her eyes as they roamed across every one of the Gods present. When they landed on Hui Yue, they stayed for quite some time.</p><p>&quot;I see,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;So there is a genius from the Celestial Sword Sect who wishes to enter the Archaic World. Coming to the Blissful Realm is the best idea, but may I ask why you have made such problems for us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We were not causing problems. However, we find the fee of a thousand Worldpower Stones for shuttles a tad unfair.&quot; Hui Yue spoke up with a clear voice, and the guard who had demanded the thousand Worldpower Stones started to feel very worried.</p><p>He had only asked for these Worldpower Stones because Hui Yue and his entourage had seemed incredibly rich and it was an easy way to gain wealth. It was something that the guards would do from time to time when they saw rich young masters, but he also knew that it was frowned upon by the lord of the realm.</p><p>&quot;Fee for entering with a shuttle?&quot; the woman asked as her eyes started to sparkle with an unpredictable light. &quot;Tell me, did he ask you a thousand worldpower stones to allow your shuttle entry into my realm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Hui Yue answered truthfully. He had long since guessed the truth about the matter and seeing that the owner of the realm was here, he was not going to let this guard go.</p><p>&quot;A thousand worldpower stones&#x2026;. Good. Very good.&quot; the woman&apos;s voice sounded out as cold as the wind during a midwinter froststorm, and her eyes sparkled with anger.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t see any shuttle right now so feel free to enter when you have paid the entrance fee of ten Worldpower Stones per person,&quot; she continued, after which she sensed the bag in the guard&apos;s hands. &quot;Ah, you already paid,&quot; she corrected herself.</p><p>&quot;In that case, welcome to my Blissful Realm. Here you can find anything you might be searching for, and you should be able to get the most up to date information about the Archaic World.&quot;</p><p>Having said this, the woman waved her hand, and the guard who had been standing with an ugly expression on his face suddenly shot backwards like a kite with its string cut.</p><p>He landed right in front of the woman, and she harrumphed after which she flew away, the guard in tow. It was clear that there would be no happy ending for this guard.</p><p>Hui Yue shook his head. He did not pity this guy; it was his own greed that had caused the situation he was in, and without an extra glance at the other guards, Hui Yue entered into the Blissful Realm closely followed by his friends.</p><p>&quot;Did you see that woman?&quot; Shen Wei asked with a low voice. His eyes glistened, and he was smiling. &quot;She is a magical beast, and when she was close by I could feel that she was a jackal like me! It seems like the heavens don&#x2019;t want this genius to be single all his life!&quot;</p><p>&quot;As if she would ever lower herself to look at you,&quot; Zhong Li, the Qilin, snorted with a chuckle. His words caused all the other beast Gods to laugh as well, but Shen Wei was not so easily defeated. The smile on his face just grew larger and larger.</p><p>&quot;If we manage to find some priceless treasures while we are in the Archaic World, we will definitely be allowed to meet with her,&quot; he smiled as he dreamed about seeing this graceful lady once more.</p><p>&quot;At that time I request that all my brothers, and sisters, put in a good word for me!&quot; Shen Wei said while laughing merrily and his mood caused all the others to laugh as well. Some even promised that if this ever were the case, then they would gladly put in as many good words as needed, while others joked and said he had no chance, even if he was the last jackal in the entire galaxy.</p><p>Listening to his brothers, Hui Yue, who had been in a foul mood because of the guard, could not help but smile as well. It was never boring with his friends around.</p><p>&quot;Young master, I suggest that we head to the center of town,&quot; Pei Ziqi suggested. &quot;There is a bazaar where you can buy almost anything, and in the middle of the square where the bazaar is there is also a pavilion belonging to the owner of the realm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The pavilion buys and sells everything that you can imagine and the most sold item is information about the Archaic World.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You seem to know a lot about this Archaic World and the Blissful Realm,&quot; Hui Yue said as he looked at Pei Ziqi who just shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>&quot;I have been here a few times,&quot; she admitted, and Hui Yue was rather surprised. &quot;Why not tell us anything beforehand then?&quot; he asked confused, but Pei Ziqi just smiled. &quot;You will have to make do on your own. I am only helping you some here in the Blissful Realm. Apart from that, I will avoid assisting you unless you are in a life threatening situation. I am after all a dao protector now; this is your own challenge.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue did not mind too much. Although Pei Ziqi was a major part of their strength, they were not weak without her.</p><p>&quot;Well then everyone, let&#x2019;s move towards the bazaar. We&#x2019;ll have a look at the many stalls one never knows if they might find something interesting there,&quot; he laughed, and together, all of them headed to the innermost areas of the realm.</p><p>The entire realm was one big city. The outskirts had housings for the citizens that lived here and the further in you traveled, the more restaurants, inns, and shops one would find. There were no slums in this realm, and it was impossible to see beggars on the streets. All in all the realm seemed very prosperous and beautiful.</p><p>Parks and gardens could be seen in the city together with big champion halls where experts could exchange blows and bet against each other while fighting.</p><p>These sort of things did not interest Hui Yue, but many of the beast Gods were instantly drawn towards these arenas in the hopes of earning a fortune.</p><p>&quot;We might try it later,&quot; Hui Yue promised them. &quot;But for now we need information and to get ready for the trip to the Archaic World. Think of all the adventures we will face. Is that not much more interesting than fighting some random experts in the arena?&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue smiled as he spoke of finding the many beasts with ancient bloodlines, the sentient treasures, and the endless herb garden. Everything he said made friends&apos; eyes glisten with anticipation and soon all of them had forgotten everything about the arena as they started to discuss what they were going to do with all the treasure they would find in their search for the Alchemist God.</p><p>The realm was bustling with energy. People called out prices for their wares on the side of the streets, children would run around the legs of the experts, and the scent of many different delicacies spread through the air from both inns, restaurants, and street stalls.</p><p>Everywhere one looked the sight was filled with smiling and exciting faces. Some were about to leave to enter the Archaic World while others were arriving either from the Archaic World or other parts of the galaxy.</p><p>When they reached the bazaar, Hui Yue finally understood what she had meant when she said that everything was present. There was everything from souls, to treasures and even ancient beasts both living and dead. There were herbs he had never seen before and ancient Ancestral Worldpower skills present at the bazaar. There were even formulas and formations as well as patterns for inscription and countless types of metals.</p><p>There were so many things that all of them took a deep breath to steady themselves. This was truly magnificent, and at the same time, the entire area was filled to the brim with cultivators. Some were haggling for prices others paid without caring. Some were looking at wares, others getting ready to sell their own stuff.</p><p>This was truly a haven for anyone who has come to the Archaic World, or a place where anything that one wanted was possible to find, but Hui Yue kept his head clear. &quot;I need information,&quot; he said with a steady voice. &quot;I will enter the pavilion and get as much information as I can. Those who want to come with me are welcome, and those who want to browse the bazaar can do so as well.&quot;</p><p>Having said that Hui Yue, Huli, Cai Jie, Wei, Pei Ziqi and Sha Yun went towards the pavilion while all the other spread out and started looking at the many items that were for sale.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
