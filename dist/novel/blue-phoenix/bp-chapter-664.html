Hui Yue was curious and wondering what they were doing so he steered the ship-like shuttle towards the others.</p><p>&quot;Hey, friend!&quot; someone yelled out from a nearby shuttle as they saw Hui Yue. The shuttle they were on was a minor one, and their group only counted around five people. It was clear that they were no more than a mercenary group here attempting to get rich quick.</p><p>&quot;Why is everyone waiting here?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously, and the members of the mercenary shuttle all flew into the air and landed on the shuttle to speak with Hui Yue much more clearly.</p><p>&quot;This is your first time in the Archaic World I take it?&quot; the man asked, and Hui Yue nodded his head.</p><p>&quot;We have someone on board who has been here before, but her lips are sealed. We won&apos;t be able to get any information from her if we can get it elsewhere.&quot; Hui Yue sighed as he looked at Pei Ziqi, but the woman just smiled vaguely saying nothing.</p><p>It was indeed true that she would stop them if they were facing certain death, but she was not willing to tell him things that he could find out on his own.</p><p>This was his journey. He had to use it to gain experience. If she gave him all answers, then he would not improve as much as he would have otherwise.</p><p>&quot;I see,&quot; the mercenary said unsure of what to say in response while he shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Well let me tell you about it then!&quot;</p><p>&quot;As you know, the worlds and realms in the Archaic World are always in flux. The massive amount of Ancestral Worldpower clashing from the many realms and worlds causes tsunamis to occur from time to time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As you can feel right now, the Ancestral Worldpower in the surrounding area is chaotic. It&#x2019;s even more chaotic than usual. This means that there will be an Ancestral Worldpower Tsunami soon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you are within the void of the Archaic World when it erupts you will be crushed by the Ancestral Worldpower waves. If you are within a world, you should be fine, but the danger is eminent for anyone who travels within the Archaic World at this time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Therefore all of us are waiting here patiently. We are waiting for the tidal waves to pass before we once more can enter the various worlds to hunt for treasure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But don&apos;t think that these tidal waves are just a bad thing,&quot; the mercenary continued as he stayed onboard the ship. &quot;The waves come from deep within the Archaic World. They always bring new worlds and realms with them, and also treasures. Therefore people eagerly wait for these tsunamis to appear so that they can find even more godly items!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So how come you are telling me all this?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously, and the mercenary got a little embarrassed as he scratched his head.</p><p>&quot;I hope us brothers can be allowed to stay on your shuttle until the tsunami has passed. Although the tidal waves are not too terrible for us outside the Archaic World, there is still some danger for us to face if we try to weather the storm on our small shuttle, and yours is much more stable than ours. Even the remnant tidal waves would not be able to cause your shuttle any damage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see,&quot; Hui Yue nodded his head. He was someone who repaid kindness and enmity, and he nodded his head in affirmation. &quot;You all can stay as long as you don&#x2019;t trouble my friends,&quot; he agreed readily before he narrowed his eyes and looked at the chaotic Ancestral Worldpower that caused ripples in the fabric of reality in front of him. He could see the worlds in the distance, the worlds that were the first worlds in the Archaic World and he could not wait to go there.</p><p>&quot;How long will it take before the tidal waves hits us?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously. He truly wanted the tidal waves to hit as soon as possible so that they could enter the Archaic World and look for the Alchemist God.</p><p>&quot;It should hit within a few days,&quot; the mercenary said honestly. &quot;There will usually be one or two tsunamis a year, and now the Ancestral Worldpower has accumulated in the inner regions and is bursting outwards. I have seen many of these tsunamis in the past, and every one of them appeared a few days after the surrounding void was as chaotic as it is now.&quot;</p><p>These things were considered so common that those he had paid for information never bothered to tell him about it before. They expected him to already know such things as anyone who he asked would tell him.</p><p>The next two days were spent in front of the Archaic World. No one dared to move forward, but quite a few experts came out from the Archaic World and even more arrived, waiting to enter.</p><p>While they waited, Hui Yue obtained all the information he could about the Archaic World from the mercenaries.</p><p>They had been hunting in the Archaic World for the past two thousand years. They had seen many worlds arrive and even more worlds disappear. They knew what type of items sold for good money, and they knew which to avoid. They had learned which things to stay away from and which to actively seek out.</p><p>These mercenaries were not the ones who sought after priceless treasures or great opportunities. They mainly hunted for ancient herbs and fierce ancient beasts.</p><p>Throughout the years their group had consisted of more members, but they had lost people time and time again. Now there were only five left, but these five survivors were all terrifying experts who even Hui Yue would have to consider twice before fighting; their combat ability was truly magnificent.</p><p>The longer they waited, the more chaotic the Ancestral Worldpower became. It was like when one looked at the air above a hot road, the air was alive and filled with energy.</p><p>After two days went by everyone was getting impatient. Everyone was watching the Archaic World with longing in their eyes, and suddenly a low thundering sound erupted from within the Archaic World.</p><p>The already chaotic Ancestral Worldpower started to form waves that crashed against the worlds in the Archaic World. They saw how the worlds trembled and shook from the impact. It was easy to guess that those who were within these worlds were being hit by severe earthquakes and other disasters.</p><p>The shockwaves and the remnant waves reached the shuttles, and they also started trembling against the pressure. Some of the smaller shuttles completely collapsed under the pressure of the Ancestral Worldpower tidal waves and the experts within were smashed to smithereens. Only those who were behind protective formations and inscriptions managed to survive.</p><p>&quot;This is one of the most terrifying tsunamis I have ever seen,&quot; the mercenary leader&apos;s eyes glistened as he said this. &quot;The more powerful the tsunami, the more marvelous the treasures that will appear from the current pulling everything along from deep within the Ancient World. Even the worlds that have already been explored will have more treasures appear as the worlds shake and more secret lairs are unearthed. Treasure grounds erupting under such earth-shaking changes as these tidal waves bring with them.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. He was not interested in the treasures that would appear, all he could think about was finding the world with the endless herb garden, the world with the sentient pill where the Alchemist God was hiding away.</p><p>It was impossible to tell what was within a world when one was looking at it from the outside, so Hui Yue had no other choice than to enter every single world that they came across. At least he knew what he was looking for was a world and not a realm, and thus he could avoid all the smaller realms. Otherwise, he would have felt that the task was simply impossible to complete, even if he used thousands of years.</p><p>Another fortunate thing was that the entire world was one big herb garden so as soon as they entered the world, they would be able to tell whether or not it was the one they were looking for or if they should move on.</p><p>Hui Yue was calm as he stood on the shuttle&apos;s deck and stared at the tidal waves that were raging outside. He saw the arrival of new worlds, and he saw new realms appearing by the hundreds. Amongst these realms, some of them were on the verge of collapsing while others were stable.</p><p>The waves were increasing in size and strength as more and more realms appeared. Many of the worlds and realms that had been stable before started to show signs of collapsing under the relentless waves that crashed from the inner region of the Archaic World.</p><p>The tsunami lasted for a full three days. The worlds were constantly being rocked and moved around by the waves and some of the realms that had just arrived at the outer perimeter collapsed shortly after from the immense pressure they were under.</p><p>Hui Yue, looking at this, started to feel worried. Although it was mainly realms that collapsed under the tidal waves some worlds also were unable to bear it and collapsed as well.</p><p>Every time a realm or world collapsed, the Ancestral Worldpower in the surrounding area would explode outwards, causing even more ripples to appear.</p><p>However as the tsunami ended, everyone was filled with excitement. The bigger shuttles set out as the weakest waves were still radiating outwards from the Archaic World and Hui Yue followed suit.</p><p>As soon as the mercenary said that the tsunami was ending, they steered the ship towards the Archaic World and started moving again.</p><p>&quot;Which world would you like to enter?&quot; Hui Yue asked the mercenaries. He intended to drop them off at whichever world they decided on as a last show of kindness because of all the information they had shared with him recently, and the leader contemplated for some time.</p><p>&quot;If you would be so kind and let us off at the first world we arrive at, the Immortal Valley then we will be very grateful. We might be able to get more treasure in the new realms, but there would also be a much bigger chance of losing our lives. We are not here to gamble our lives; we are here to earn a living.&quot;</p><p>Hearing the expert speak like this, Hui Yue could instantly sense that he was eager to see the new realms, but because of his responsibility, he decided to choose the safe route. The most important part for him was to ensure that his brothers and he survived.</p><p>Approving of this man&apos;s decision, Hui Yue headed straight for the world in front of him, and as he reached it, they said their goodbyes. It was now time for them to move on. They had to explore the new worlds as soon as they had said good bye.</p><p>Everywhere around him there was quite a lot of experts rushing to these new worlds. All the cultivator&#x2019;s eyes glistened with energy, and a faint trace of madness flashed through many of their eyes as they rushed towards these realms and worlds with great hopes.</p><p>&quot;Why are we not rushing forward too?&quot; Wan Qiao asked confused as she saw that they were taking their time reaching the world, but Hui Yue just smiled.</p><p>&quot;The chances of our world being here is very small, but we will enter them anyway. Still, there is a chance that they are filled with traps. Letting others experience these traps before us, will make things much safer.&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
