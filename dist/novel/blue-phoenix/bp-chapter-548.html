He actually healed someone who had launched a sneak attack on him, and this caused the animosity in their hearts to soften a little. When they looked at Huli, however, their hearts were filled with fear.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They already knew that she was the beast companion of Hui Yue and from her aura alone they could feel that she was an Immortal of Creation. The person she attacked was almost an Immortal of Creation as well, yet he could hardly react to her attack let alone defend against it, and it seemed this beast used nothing but her sheer strength. Her paws that had shredded through his body contained not even the slightest trace of any dao.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze was the only one who had heard what Hui Yue had said; everyone else was certain that he had used some esoteric dao of life.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is good to see that you are treating them like your family already. Sparring is fine, but killing is not accepted.&quot; Pei Ze said happily, but Hui Yue just smiled.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I truly don&#x2019;t care whether he lives or dies,&quot; he mumbled to himself. &quot;Only if he were to die, I am sure that Huli would be in trouble for killing the idiot; thus I obviously had to heal him.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue mumbled, Pei Ze was able to understand the words he spoke while no one else caught what was said. Pei Ze&apos;s face had a slight smile on his lips, to be honest, he too did not care whether or not this particular person lived or died. Although they were in the same family, he was weak, and of no use to Pei Ze. Therefore he really didn&#x2019;t care whether or not he survived.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, on the other hand, showed great potential. He was clearly loyal to his friends, ruthless when he needed to be ruthless, and friendly and benevolent when that was needed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that Hui Yue was someone he needed to lure over to his side at almost any cost. Hui Yue, who was aware of Pei Ze&apos;s agenda, was also quite surprised at how this young man was capable of holding himself back while waiting for Hui Yue to make a decision on his own.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While Pei Ze and Hui Yue were deep in thought, the expert, who had been healed by Hui Yue, awoke. At first, he was startled and then he started screaming.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His hands landed on his torn clothes and touched the places where the wounds should have been but his scream lost power, and the expression of fear and agony on his face turned into confusion and surprise.</p><p dir="ltr">Touching the skin and looking down at himself he saw no signs of the wounds ever having been there. There was not even a single scar left behind. All traces of the attack were gone.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Realizing this, the expert had mixed emotions. He was obviously excited that he was not near death. Being dead was the last thing he wanted, but he also cursed that no signs of the wounds were left behind.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If he were to go to the elders now and complain about Hui Yue and his companion, the elders would not listen to him. Who would listen to someone without a single wound on their body claiming that they were mauled to pieces and almost died?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master Pei Ze, thank you for saving this lowly one!&quot; After a bit, the expert reached the conclusion that the best solution was the one he had experienced. He was still alive, and that was the most important thing. As such he had to pay respect to the one who had saved him. Amongst the many people present, only Pei Ze could have the ability to save him as quickly as he had.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I did not heal you,&quot; Pei Ze said, neither friendly nor hostile. &quot;The one who saved you was Pei Yue. Although you launched a sneak attack on him, he still spent his own energy to remove every trace of the wounds from your body. You should thank him. Although his beast companion went a little berserk, you did start it.&quot; Pei Ze said, and his words caused the expert in question&apos;s face to turn red with embarrassment. He had been saved by the person who he wanted to cripple. This was truly embarrassing.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are all members of the same family, and we are the scions of the Celestial Sword Sect. We are not bandits, and we do not need to use such tactics to get what we want. We need to prove that we are worthy of being a top sect!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze spoke loud and clear, and everyone heard his words, and they caused their hearts to swell with pride. Yes, they were all scions of the Celestial Sword Sect. They were exceptional experts and geniuses amongst the entire younger generation. They did not need to embarrass themselves; they had to stay strong!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was surprised as he saw this. &quot;Mind control,&quot; he mumbled to himself, and the word caused the corner of Pei Ze&apos;s mouth to curl slightly as he gave Hui Yue a meaningful glance.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Turning to leave, Pei Ze and Hui Yue paid no more attention to the group of experts that had gathered on the sparring field. Pei Ze planned to show Hui Yue around, so the two experts started to leave when suddenly an arrogant voice echoed out.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, well, well, if it isn&apos;t cousin Pei Ze!&quot; Turning to look, Hui Yue saw a young man who seemed slightly older than himself and Pei Ze walking towards them. Right behind him was a large group of experts, and one of the experts was Pei Chen. Seeing him, Hui Yue&apos;s eyes narrowed and so did Pei Ze&apos;s.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue was certain that this group had come to cause trouble, Pei Ze was secretly rejoicing. The leader of the group was Pei Feng, the biggest opponent that Pei Ze had to inheriting the sect leader&#x2019;s position.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the sect leader was below the ten head elders, the patriarch, and the ancestors, it was still a very respected position, and everyone with power wished to become the sect leader. When you had been sect leader for a period of a thousand years, you would be promoted to one of the ten head elder&apos;s positions and the oldest head elder would retire.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, no one knew exactly how many outstanding experts the Celestial Sword Sect actually had. Many of the retired experts were already at the pinnacle of power, but even so, they had to follow the rule and retire when it was their turn.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If some day the Celestial Sword Sect were to join a war, the amount of supreme experts they could bring out was probably a very terrifying number, and because of this many stayed clear of the sect and never insulted the family.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, there were two hundred years until the current sect leader was promoted to a head elder and the two possible heirs were Pei Ze and Pei Feng.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze was rejoicing because he knew that currently, Pei Feng had no idea who Hui Yue was. If he knew, it was obvious that Pei Feng would do anything in his power to get him on his side, but he was clearly coming to seek revenge for Pei Chen.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You there! You white-haired bastard!&quot; He called out and pointed at Hui Yue who lazily looked at Pei Feng. Although he seemed casual and lazy on the outside, Hui Yue understood that Pei Feng was nothing like Pei Chen.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Chen was simple to deal with. Just a spacelock was enough to defeat him, but the pressure he felt from Pei Feng was on an entirely different level.</p><p dir="ltr">Huli felt the same, and when Pei Feng pointed at Hui Yue, she took a step forward. A low growl could be heard from her throat as the wind started picking up.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this beast companion stepping forward and understanding her strength Pei Feng was quite surprised.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You challenged him because of this beast companion?&quot; Pei Feng asked Pei Chen who nodded his head. Within his eyes was still a greedy gleam which he could not hide very well. He really wanted to possess a beast companion like Huli.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, she is quite outstanding... How did a new God like you manage to contract such a beast?&quot; Pei Feng asked with a frown on his face. He finally felt that something was off, but he could not put his finger on exactly what it was. Although he spoke, no one could hear the words he said; his conclusions were left for him alone.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You were referred to as young master by the Fu brothers,&quot; Pei Feng concluded, clearly thinking about what exactly was the reason this situation felt off.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This means you are a member of the inner sect, but I have never seen you before. This means that you were born outside of the sect, and anyone born outside of the sect should have been killed instantly upon notice, but you are still alive... Even more so, Pei Ze has been told to keep you company. From this one can see just how much the elders value you.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Feng was mumbling to himself and his every word made him feel a headache coming on. He knew he was not wrong, but he also knew that since he was not wrong, then this person in front of him was someone he could not afford to insult. Still, someone from his entourage had already insulted him. How should he fix this?</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Cousin Pei Ze, why don&apos;t you introduce this new member of our family to me?&quot; He asked with a friendly voice, but both Hui Yue, Huli, and Pei Ze could not forget that he had been called a bastard mere moments before. The smile on Pei Ze&apos;s face expanded.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let me introduce Pei Yue to you. He is new to our family, but he is of the third generation. He is the direct nephew of our patriarch and the ancestors. He will be joining our family in the future, and he will also participate in the trials with us.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Feng&apos;s face turned green as he heard this introduction. What did it mean to be of the third generation? It meant a great deal. The respect and position he could have in the sect were simply far above his. Even if he turned into the sect master, he would still have to treat Hui Yue with respect. Knowing that he had already insulted him, his intestines turned green with regret, unfortunately, there was no cure for regret, and all he could do was feel bad.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Feng glared at Pei Chen who was deeply shocked. Not only him, everyone else in Pei Feng&apos;s entourage was filled with shock as they heard the words Pei Ze said.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Please excuse me for now, I am sure that you are busy,&quot; Pei Feng said and with a wave of his sleeves, he turned to leave with rapid steps. Everyone knew that Hui Yue had been insulted by Pei Feng and that this would affect his future accomplishments and chances at becoming the sect leader.</p><p dir="ltr">As they left Pei Feng&apos;s face was stern and unhappy, but suddenly he stopped as they were out of range of Hui Yue and Pei Ze.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will make sure that you won&apos;t survive these trials. You will be buried here in Diyu, and I will put all the blame on Pei Ze. Getting rid of both of them at once will be beneficial for me.&quot; He mumbled to himself and suddenly started laughing. He was going to get rid of anyone who stepped in the way of his goals.</p><br></div><p></p>
