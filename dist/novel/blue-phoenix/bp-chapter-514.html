These pills would help increase their strength, and anything which increased their strength right now was something they would do anything to get their hands on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The bid for the Dragon Bone Cleansing pills ended at an astonishing one hundred and ten thousand Worldpower Stones. Although the price was truly extravagant, the ones purchasing them were incredibly excited not seeming to mind at all. It was as if the person who won did not even notice the amount of money he had paid for the set of pills.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Next up is a pill we have had at our Auction House for quite awhile. The pill is called the Pill of Clarity.&quot; The auctioneer paused for a moment to allow his words to sink in.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His words caused an uproar in the auction house. A Pill of Clarity? This was insane; the Pill of Clarity was a priceless treasure, a treasure no one would ever want to get rid of, yet someone had actually sold such a pill to Treasure Mountain? Shocking!</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue looked at Huli as he heard the shocked voices around him. &quot;Is it really that amazing?&quot; He asked causing Huli to smirk. &quot;I have more than that one,&quot; she said in return, and Hui Yue could not help but laugh under his breath. Of course, Huli would never get rid of something unless she had no use for it, or she had a surplus.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Just watch the show, the bids will skyrocket.&quot; She said with a smile, and Hui Yue just laughed. &quot;Did we sell it too cheap?&quot; He asked. That was his only current concern, but Huli just shrugged her shoulders. &quot;It would sell for a lot more than what we got, but currently we need the Worldpower Stones much more than we need the pill. Also having a pill like that will spell calamity unless they have the strength to keep it.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue suddenly understood. Buying treasures with one&#x2019;s wealth was also a display of arrogance. It was an arrogance that said that they had money, but also the strength to keep the items they were buying. It seemed that this auction was nowhere as simple as it seemed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;So if possible should we avoid buying anything?&quot; Hui Yue asked Huli, but she just shook her head. &quot;If you find something you want, then you should go for it as long as we have enough Worldpower Stones we should buy it. With the two of us together, no one will be able to steal from us.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Fighting within the city is illegal, so we would just need to hold on until the guards appear,&quot; Huli said with a shrug of her shoulders. &quot;You might have just become a God, but your strength is not to be looked down upon, and with me by your side, they are dumb if they think they can defeat us easily.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding his head, Hui Yue secretly thought to himself that there would likely not be anything that would catch his interest.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Five hundred thousand Worldpower Stones!&quot; A frantic voice sounded from one of the booths where the true VIP were sitting. The bid was truly extravagant, but even so, Hui Yue just smiled. He looked at the many people in the audience who were interested in buying this pill. To make things more interesting, Hui Yue lifted his card and called out in a clear voice, &quot;seven hundred thousand Worldpower Stones!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">This was as much as Huli had gotten for all three of her pills but this did not seem to faze him in the slightest.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone&apos;s eyes landed on Hui Yue, and when they saw that he was casually sitting there, they all started wondering what kind of young master he was and started guessing at his background. The ones who had followed behind him earlier were even more shocked. Although the item up for sale was priceless, seven hundred thousand Worldpower Stones was an incredible amount of wealth. Most of the experts present did not possess such wealth. And most of them were here for the sake of seeing other experts.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Seven hundred and twenty thousands Worldpower Stones.&quot; The person from the booth said with clenched teeth. His face was no longer as excited as it had been before and his eyes were focused on Hui Yue. Clearly, if eyes could kill then Hui Yue would have been dead by now.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If you want it then you can have it,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled with a shrug and a leisurely smile on his face as if it did not matter to him either way. By then everyone understood that he had only raised the price for his amusement. To use seven hundred thousand Worldpower Stones for amusement, even the richest experts present were shocked by this.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Most assumed that Hui Yue had bid all he had for the item and was currently hiding his disappointment behind his casual demeanor, but the stronger experts would have been able to sense any slight disappointment in him, and they could tell he was clearly not faking his carefreeness.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Seven hundred and fifty thousand Worldpower Stones,&quot; Another voice called out. This person too was looking at Hui Yue rather than the other bidder. He feared that since Hui Yue had casually called out such a high price before, he could easily do so again?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, however, was not willing to end up with the pill as it was the one he had sold in the first place.</p><p dir="ltr">Huli looked at Hui Yue with admiration. It was clear that they were here for the sake of making a name for themselves, but she had never thought Hui Yue would do it in such a way. She secretly approved of the move.</p><p dir="ltr">The bidding for the Pill of Clarity was just between these two people, and the pill ended up with a human cultivator at the cost of nine hundred and fifteen thousand Worldpower Stones. Although this was considered a priceless treasure, the cost had been incredibly high.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After this pill, set after set of pills were auctioned off on stage. Some of these pills were to feel specific daos better while others increased the absorption rate of Ancestral Worldpower. There was even a pill which increased one&apos;s luck. It was known as the Pill of Good Fortune. Although it did not truly increase one&apos;s luck, it could be considered as doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">What it did was enhance one&apos;s sensitivity towards treasures. One would be able to feel the general location of treasures in the surrounding area. Such pills were incredibly rare as they required a great many treasures to concoct. They were, however, very useful in situations where one was exploring ancient ruins or the like.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We&#x2019;ve now finished the pills. It is time to go onto the treasure items!&quot; The auctioneer announced with his loud voice filled with excitement. Everyone was aptly paying attention to the stage after hearing his voice. While pills could enhance one&apos;s strength, treasures could temporarily improve strength, and more importantly, they could save one&apos;s life.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In a situation like this where they were about to undertake unknown challenges, having life-saving treasures was a must for everyone. Treasure Mountain knew this and planned to auction off quite a few.</p><p dir="ltr">Treasure Mountain had both spiritual blacksmiths and alchemists that created ordinary treasures which anyone could buy at any time as long as they had enough Worldpower Stones. The items up for auction were true treasures; treasures created by grandmasters or found through exploration or slaughter.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was curious about these items, but deep within he still remembered the items he had found in the universe box; the items he had shared with his friends.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Three of these items, the Circlet of Deep Abyss, the Locket of the Nine Heavens, and the Scroll of the Vengeful Yama had all been given to Wang Ju Long, but she had died before she had the chance to use them. Thinking about them now, Hui Yue felt a sour taste in his mouth. He now possessed all three treasures. One of them was even capable of blocking a God for a whole breath of time, yet no matter how strong they were, Hui Yue would trade them for Wang Ju Long without a doubt.</p><p dir="ltr">Thinking about this, he shook his head. &apos;Remember the words Huli said earlier,&apos; Lan Feng said in Hui Yue&apos;s mind. &apos;You have to live brightly; you have to live every day with happiness to repay the love you received. Wang Ju Long would not want you to suffer like this.&apos;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue listened to Lan Feng and nodded his head. He knew that the phoenix was correct, but he was still depressed about his loss. Suddenly, he felt Huli squeeze his hand, and he sent a small smile to her to show that he was fine. Realizing how spoiled he was with friends who cared about him, and that he was surrounded with people he could trust, Hui Yue buried the sorrow deep within himself. Sorrow and regret could do nothing; he needed to be focused on reviving Wang Ju Long and to do so he needed to be steady. He felt how his soul was undergoing a strange change. It was as if the world was opening up to him as if he could see through everything at once and his soul was growing increasingly stronger.</p><p dir="ltr">This sudden change was not felt by anyone else, but Hui Yue could feel he was getting stronger and stronger. His consciousness swept across the entire auction house and he felt as if he could feel the entire room breathing. He could see everything as if he was hovering in the air looking down on them; he could hear every single whisper said in the room.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Huli noticed the shocked expression on Hui Yue&apos;s face, and the astonishment caused her to be curious, but she asked nothing. Hui Yue would tell her when it was time for her to know what was going on.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was too busy focusing on this newfound ability to notice what was happening on the stage. One item after another was displayed, but what he focused on was not what these things did but how the audience was reviewing them, their reactions, and the secrets that were whispered between friends. He observed the way people were eagerly trying to win items. He was especially interested in the ones bidding, noticing the minute differences in their expressions, their excitement, and their disappointment. He could almost feel their emotions even if they tried to hide it from their faces.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Buy this item!&quot; A voice suddenly resounded in Hui Yue&apos;s mind with excitement. &quot;This is an item you have to buy! Even if you spend your entire fortune on it, you need to buy it!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The voice clearly belonged to the soul of the Universe Box, and Hui Yue had never before seen him this eager. He was stumped, but just at that moment he heard someone call out a bid. &quot;One million twenty-four thousand Worldpower Stones!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing, his consciousness entered the universe box. &quot;I don&apos;t have the money for it,&quot; he said honestly. He was rather curious about the item that could make even the universe box go crazy.</p><br></div><p></p>
