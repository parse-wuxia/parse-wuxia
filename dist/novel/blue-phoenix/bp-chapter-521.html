Either way would prove beneficial to Hui Yue, but the dragon was not going to let him just do as he pleased.</p><p dir="ltr">White energy erupted from its body laying a thick protective layer on top of its scaled skin.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The wolf head seemed to be sentient as it noticed that its devouring attack had not worked, so it closed its mouth. After letting out yet another silent roar, it once more advanced towards the dragon with bared fangs.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Reaching the dragon, the two were staring at one another ready to begin their fight, and everyone else had retreated so they could just observe what would happen.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the attack seemed sentient, the reason behind it was that its every move was dictated by Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His consciousness had left his body and was floating in the energy attack he was using, but this also caused him to be more cautious. He ordered Huli to guard his body while he was trying to wound the dragon.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After the red wolf finished roaring, it dug its fangs down into the throat of the dragon which was trying to climb up from beneath the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, it was completely blocked by the white energy which surrounded the beast, protecting it from incoming attacks, but Hui Yue was not your average cultivator.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As he looked at the scene in front of him, his eyes turned cold. He reached out his arm and clenched his hand into a fist.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Break for me!&quot; He roared out, and all the guards were shocked when they saw that the wolf head which had dimmed as the fight went on suddenly flared with energy. It seemed as if it was on fire and the teeth finally managed to dig through the defensive barrier protecting the dragon, only to be stopped by its thick scales.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t underestimate me!&quot; Hui Yue growled as he with his other hand allowed for some of his Ancestral Worldpower to take on the aspects of the dao of inferno. As he did, Hui Yue created a flaming arrow which he shot out from a flaming bow formed from Ancestral Worldpower. This arrow was sharp and filled with his profound insights into the dao of inferno, not to mention that the dao itself was chaotic and destructive.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This arrow was no exception. It flew forward at a terrifying speed that Hui Yue had not known was possible. The arrow was aimed straight at the hole in the protective layer of Qi around the dragon and struck the hard scales.</p><p dir="ltr">&#xA0;The moment the arrow and the scales touched, the volatile energy within the arrow turned into a massive explosion that shook the surrounding area.</p><p dir="ltr">His red wolf head was almost completely transparent as most of its energy had been used up when the two collided. Now only a little bit of energy remained but this did not make Hui Yue pause his attacks. He now sunk his sharp teeth into the soft flesh and bone that opened up from the last attack and this caused the dragon to roar out in pain.</p><p dir="ltr">The claws which were used to drag the dragon&#x2019;s massive body out of the underground prison were now used to try and destroy the energy wolf head which was attached to his neck. But no matter how he tried he couldn&#x2019;t shake the energy attack off while it kept biting down harder and harder.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Blood flew everywhere, and the wolf head did everything in its power to devour as much of this blood and flesh it could. The blood essence and the dragon essence flowed into Hui Yue&apos;s body and gathering in his core waiting for him to refine it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the soul from earlier, this was pure blood and beast essence and contained no ability to resist as it had no will of its own, so storing it all within his core was not hard at all.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">What was challenging though was maintaining his wolf head attack. To keep attacking he needed to continue to use his Ancestral Worldpower, and even though he was absorbing as much Ancestral Worldpower as he could from the surrounding areas, it was not enough to keep up.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What are you all doing?!&quot; Huli roared out as she saw that Hui Yue was attacking the dragon on his own. &quot;Do you think he can kill it on his own? He is not Yanluo!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Huli&apos;s yell seemed to cause the guards and the City Lord to awaken from their stupor, and they grit their teeth before they once more started unleashing their attacks.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">All of the many attacks were aimed at the small opening in the white energy cloak Hui Yue had managed to tear open. After attacking for a few more moments, Hui Yue pulled back and finally allowed for the wolf head to dissipate into nothingness.</p><p dir="ltr">He could feel that he had devoured a major amount of blood and beast essence, and this was the essence of a real dragon! When refined it would allow for him to become even stronger than he was now. The blood essence of a real dragon was a true treasure and beast essence even more so as it had to be extracted from a living beast.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue had withdrawn the wolf head, he was far from finished with the battle as he once more created a flaming bow and arrows from which he kept shooting the dragon. The arrows were imbued with the dao of inferno and fully formed from one of the most destructive and violent energies that one could control.</p><p dir="ltr">As the arrows repeatedly collided with the energy armor on the dragon, Hui Yue managed to break through the white energy making more spaces for the guards to attack the dragon.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Something is wrong,&quot; Hui Yue suddenly said to Huli as his eyes narrowed slightly and he looked around. Many experts had arrived, and all of them were attacking the dragon, but even so, it was not being injured.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It&#x2019;s feigning weakness,&quot; Hui Yue said as he instantly stopped firing arrow after arrow at the dragon. &quot;It intentionally wanted everyone to attack it in a frenzy, but if you look, only one attack has succeeded in breaking its scales.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I highly doubt that this is because I&#x2019;m so much stronger than everyone else here, I think it is because it wants to seem weak until everyone has used their energy and then it will explode with power, free itself, and slaughter us all!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had not whispered the words he spoke and despite them not being loud, everyone present was a God ranked cultivator and could easily hear him. In response to what he said, everyone was staring at Hui Yue as if he were a lunatic but a low growl could be heard from the dragon below. Hate was evident in its eyes as it looked at Hui Yue, hate and cunningness.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The claws which had up till now been used for defense were now used to drag the dragon&#x2019;s massive body out of the underground prison, and since its plan had been exposed, the dragon released a resounding roar. Afterwards, a white energy billowed out from its body blocking every single attack which was thrown at it. The wound on its neck that Hui Yue had caused slowly started to heal, and the scales of the beast started shining with a pure white energy that was released from its body. Now its advance from the underground prison was many times quicker than before.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at the sudden increase in the dragon&apos;s speed many of the observers turned around to escape. Everyone could feel that staying would be the most dangerous thing to do.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Despite what everyone else was doing, Huli and Hui Yue just stayed at the top of the building, observing what was happening. Hui Yue gently stroked his palm, ready to drag Huli with him into the Universe Box if needed.</p><p dir="ltr">Although many of the experts vanished, the guards had sworn an oath to protect Skydragon Fortress until the end, and therefore they could not escape. Instead, they stored their power so that they could release their strongest attacks.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&#x2019;s show them what a true attack looks like!&quot; Huli called out as Ancestral Worldpower billowed out of her body. The previous windless street suddenly had a gentle breeze, and this gentle breeze turned into a gale which soon turned into a large tornado. The wind was increasing in speed so fast that everyone was shocked.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was no ordinary dao! This was a major dao which was descending upon them; this was the major dao of wind!</p><p dir="ltr">To comprehend this dao, one needed to have comprehended and merged the minor daos that composed the dao of wind. Only then could one comprehend a major dao! To have such achievements in the dao one had to be an outstanding genius throughout the galaxy. Only the most supreme of experts had managed to comprehend two major daos... Perhaps this woman was one of them?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone, except the dragon, felt relief in their hearts when they saw just how powerful Huli really was. Everyone watched as thousands of small wind blades appeared all around her and with a glint in her eyes, Huli pulled out two thin, short swords.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Swordlight merged with the wind blades and one after another they shot through the air, leaving behind a howling sound as their speed was faster than the eye could see.</p><p dir="ltr">Boom after boom resounded as these wind blades with swordlight landed on the body of the dragon, and even though this dragon was strong, it staggered slightly when faced with the attack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One wind blade by itself did not do much damage to the dragon, however, when thousands of them hit at the same time, it was impossible to guard against all of them and the white armor around the dragon finally succumbed to the pressure. After shattering the dragons white protective energy, the wind blades dug through the spaces between the scales and pierced the dragon. Some of the wind blades never got through the scales, but Huli kept creating more and more wind blades sending one after another at the dragon without showing any signs of fatigue.</p><p dir="ltr">The dragon which was under the constant barrage of attacks hissed out loud as it completely ignored the many guards who were attacking it. It only had eyes for Hui Yue and Huli, and its eyes were filled with a desire to rip them apart and swallow their bodies.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My turn,&quot; Hui Yue said as he released Ancestral Worldpower from within his body causing a large black hole to appear above his head. This black hole sucked up everything in reach.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The black hole swiftly moved towards the dragon, and the remnants of the white energy that had been used for the armor were swallowed up whole by this black hole that Hui Yue controlled.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The dragon watched with dismay as it saw this energy devouring force and it summoned yet more white energy which just shot towards the black hole only to be devoured as easily as its first set of energy.</p><p dir="ltr">While the black hole was moving closer and closer to the dragon, it swallowed all the Ancestral Worldpower in the surroundings alongside all the energy that belonged to the dragon. Hui Yue&apos;s head was covered with beads of sweat and he grit his teeth tightly. Controlling the raging energy that was being swallowed up whole was in no way an easy task, yet just as he felt overwhelmed, he suddenly noticed that the dragon&#x2019;s blood essence he had stored within his core was starting to react to the energy he was devouring.</p><br></div><p></p>
