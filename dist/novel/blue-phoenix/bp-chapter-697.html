On their return, they had stopped in the Netherworld, Youdu, where they had stayed for a full month.</p><p>While there Hui Yue had refined a body for the King Chujiang. He had not wanted to stay in Youdu for long. Hui Yue had been away from the Celestial Sword Sect for a very long time now, and he felt that he should hurry back and quickly settle things.</p><p>Being back at the Celestial Sword Sect, Hui Yue truly felt as if he had come home. He turned around, smiled at Wang Ju Long, and took her hand into his own.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t be scared,&quot; he said tenderly as he rubbed the top of her hand with his thumb. &quot;They are all very friendly people.&quot;</p><p>Wang Ju Long looked at Hui Yue as if he were an idiot and snorted, &quot;Who is scared?&quot; she asked with a determined voice. Hui Yue, who had wanted to make her feel better understood that although Wang Ju Long had died, she was still the same headstrong person she had been before.</p><p>Feeling reassured, Hui Yue nodded his head with a gentle smile on his lips.</p><p>Although Wang Ju Long showed a tough front, she did not remove the hand that Hui Yue was holding. Her petite hand was trembling slightly as she looked at the massive sect in front of her.</p><p>&quot;Wait,&quot; just as they were about to enter through the formation that surrounded the sect, Pei Ziqi called out with a bit of panic in her voice.</p><p>&quot;Only those who are members of the Celestial Sword Sect may enter the sect,&quot; Pei Ziqi said, and Hui Yue remembered that when the others had entered the sect, all of them had undergone some sort of ritual with Pei Ziqi first.</p><p>Realizing that if Hui Yue had just taken Wang Ju Long inside the sect without going through the ritual, she would have been ripped to shreds and even her soul would have scattered across the heavens and the earth, he felt sweat starting to pour down his back.</p><p>Hui Yue turned to look at Pei Ziqi who took out a dagger and cut her own arm. Usually, a small dagger like that would absolutely be incapable of injuring her body, but since she was self-inflicting the wound, the knife managed to cut through the skin.</p><p>Some energy poured out of the wound, as Wang Ju Long got cut similarly on her arm. The two open wounds touched each other, and a bright light shone around Wang Ju Long&apos;s body.</p><p>&quot;She can enter now,&quot; Pei Ziqi said, but her voice was tired. It was clear that to do this ritual she had needed to exhaust quite a bit of energy.</p><p>&quot;Make sure to go to your father first thing and introduce Wang Ju Long,&quot; Pei Ziqi said with a tired voice. &quot;I need to return to my own home to recuperate for a bit, such a long trip as this one was quite tiring.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are back in the sect, so it is not possible for assassins to attack you. Just be at ease and stay for some time.&quot;</p><p>Wei and Deng Wu had returned to the City of Endless Clouds where they had lived for fifty years prior. They had a small courtyard in the city where they lived, and just like Hui Yue felt good returning home.</p><p>Hui Yue did as Pei Ziqi said and went straight to the mountain which belonged to his father. He held Wang Ju Long hand, and behind him, both Sha Yun and Huli followed.</p><p>Everywhere they went people started gossiping about him. Some recognized him and two of the women while others did not, but after hearing about the name Pei Yue, everyone knew who he was.</p><p>Some looked at him with reverence. Many girls wished that he took a liking to them, but when they saw that he came flying in with three women, all of their eyes turned slightly red.</p><p>Some of the men were jealous of him not only because of the three women but also because of his strength and fame within the top sects of the galaxy.</p><p>He was the person people idealized about. He was a King of Hell! He had become an Immortal of Creation while still being a part of the younger generation! He was a third-generation descendant of the Great Roc, and one of his fiances had provided the most outstanding dowry in the history of the sect!</p><p>Even just one of these things would be enough to cause many to be jealous, but all of them together was enough to truly rule over every other member of the younger generation, and even many of the older generations would dream about having such fame.</p><p>Wang Ju Long held on tightly to Hui Yue&apos;s hand. Her face was blushing, and she looked down all the time not daring to meet the faces of anyone present.</p><p>Huli, Sha Yun, and Hui Yue completely ignored everyone else, and together all four of them made it to the mountain top.</p><p>&quot;Father, are you in?&quot; Hui Yue asked with a loud voice as he knocked on the entrance.</p><p>&quot;Little Yue, you&#x2019;re back?&quot; A voice came from the inside of the mountain, and Hui Yue felt warmth spread through his body as he heard the familiar voice that was filled with pride and happiness stemming from the depths of his father&apos;s soul.</p><p>&quot;Oh who is this little girl?&quot; his father asked as he stepped towards the entrance as his eyes landed on Wang Ju Long who was still staring at the ground beneath her feet, her face beet red.</p><p>&quot;It&#x2019;s her,&quot; Hui Yue said with a great smile on his face. &quot;Your last daughter-in-law. All of your daughters-in-law have gathered here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good! Very good! Let&#x2019;s go speak with your uncles and get them to approve of your final fiance. Then it is time for us to get ready to celebrate the actual wedding!&quot; Hui Yue&apos;s father was filled with excitement, and his face was filled with a giant smile as he looked at the four people in front of him.</p><p>&quot;Let&apos;s go,&quot; Hui Yue agreed, and together all of them headed towards the place where his uncle, the patriarch of the sect, resided. As long as he approved of Wang Ju Long, then no one could say anything about it.</p><p>Hui Yue was nervous, but he could feel that Wang Ju Long, although she refused to show it on her face or display her unease in any way, was tense and worried.</p><p>She was new to all these places and everything that was happening to her, and she had just been thrown in front of Hui Yue&apos;s second father.</p><p>Although Hui Yue had spent the entire trip home telling her everything he knew about the Celestial Sword Sect and his family, Wang Ju Long was still shocked by the sudden changes that were happening around her. Everything was happening so fast.</p><p>Lei, Jo, and Lao had gone home towards the valley that belonged to Hui Yue and his family. They knew what Hui Yue was going to do, it had to do with him and the women, and it was not their place to butt in.</p><p>They reached the mountain that belonged to the patriarch, and as they entered, a rumbling sounded throughout the entire mountain, &quot;You might be my little brother, but don&apos;t just enter my mountain!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop being so negative; I bring great news!&quot; Hui Yue&apos;s father said with a harrumph as he swaggered right through the entrance of the mountain not caring at all about the snort that the patriarch released.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t just stand there, come!&quot; he said as he looked over his shoulder at the stumped Hui Yue and the three nervous women.</p><p>Shaking his head with a hidden smile on his face, Hui Yue stepped forward and entered.</p><p>&quot;Oh Little Yue is back?&quot; the voice of the patriarch sounded again, this time filled with happiness instead of anger. After a short moment the figure of the patriarch appeared from one of the rooms, walking towards them.</p><p>&quot;Welcome back little Yue!&quot; he exclaimed with happiness on his face. His eyes landed on Huli and Sha Yun, instantly recognizing them, but when his eyes landed on Wang Ju Long a frown appeared on his eyes before it seemed as if something dawned upon him, and suddenly his smile returned.</p><p>&quot;This must be the miss that I have heard so much about!&quot; the patriarch said as he looked at Wang Ju Long with tenderness in his eyes. It was much akin to how one would look at their own daughter.</p><p>&quot;I hear that you sacrificed your life to protect little Yue, such an act deserves respect! Even the strongest of all might not be able to completely disregard their own safety for the sake of their loved ones. What you did requires even an old man like me to accept that your willpower is so strong that I can only approve of you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The three of you will become the wives of our Pei Yue. You will become real members of our Celestial Sword Sect.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suggest that we make this wedding grand,&quot; the patriarch said with a solemn voice. &quot;We wish to invite all the major sects in the Galaxy. They all know about Pei Yue and his position as a King of Hell so many will want to use this as a way to get closer to our sect and our heavenly sent talent.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We cannot only invite some and not the others, and since this is the case, we might as well invite them all.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue had expected that they would just have a small ceremony with his friends and family, but it seemed that this was not going to be as simple as had wanted.</p><p>&quot;Who will be the principal wife?&quot; Hui Yue&apos;s father finally asked a question which had been left unsaid by the others up until now.</p><p>&quot;They are all equally important to me,&quot; Hui Yue said with a serious face as he looked at the three of them, and all of them smiled at him, but Pei Tian did not accept this answer and shook his head.</p><p>&quot;When we hold the marriage we need to have one of them be the principal wife. Although I know that you value all of them equally and that you do not wish to choose one over the others, but we need something to show the world.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue was just about to say that he would show the world just how uncaring he was when Wang Ju Long tugged his hand.</p><p>&quot;I think it is right,&quot; she said with a serious expression on her face, and then she turned to look at Huli. &quot;I would suggest that we make Huli the principal wife. She has lived for the longest, sacrificed the most for Hui Yue, and waited for him for eons. I do not say that her love is more than what the rest of us feel,&quot; and as she said this, she blushed while staring at the ground. But even so she continued displaying her determination to make herself clear, &quot;But Huli is the oldest. She is our senior. It is only right that she becomes the principal wife.&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
