The rest mist slowly enveloped Hui Yue, and he acutely remembered all the memories of the red wolf. As the memories flood through his mind, he reexperienced the life of the red wolf. He remembered the red wolf&#x2019;s happiness from playing with his siblings when he was a young pup to the time the wolf fought for his own territory within the cold and desolate northern taiga where he had grown up.</p><p dir="ltr">He experienced his wolf-self leaving the taiga and stepping onto the path of a true cultivator. He reexperienced the red wolf&#x2019;s long journey through the human&#x2019;s world outside his homeland. He watched all the wolf&#x2019;s hardships and joys. He experienced both love and betrayal, both hellish life and death battles and breathtaking sceneries which seemed to purify one&#x2019;s soul.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As he experienced the entire life of the red wolf once again, he felt something within his heart stir. He seemed to become stronger and stronger from reliving these memories again, and he felt the wolf&#x2019;s desire to kill surge over him as he experienced death once more.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Soon the entire red mist had evaporated. It had been absorbed by Hui Yue, and the young man was left alone in an empty cave. There was nothing left but silence.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue stood in that empty cave for some time. He had relived the wolf&#x2019;s whole life. It was an experience that felt incredibly real. Although only a brief moment had passed, it felt like an eternity to Hui Yue who had lived through it.</p><p dir="ltr">He now understood the red wolf far more than he had before. He also felt as though he had gained complete insight into the abilities of controlling the red mist.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This could be a great opportunity.&quot; Hui Yue mused to himself. &quot;This is my chance to understand more about these other lives of mine; I cannot let this chance go!&quot; And so Hui Yue rushed to the next cave, the cave of the blue cloud.</p><p dir="ltr">Entering the cave, and the permeating blue cloud, Hui Yue felt it was very similar to entering the red mist. He reexperienced the blue monk&#x2019;s life and something within his heart resonated with these memories. Something made his heart quake as everything felt even more real than when he had merged with this part of his soul the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Reliving all the memories, Hui Yue felt an even greater connection to his previous life. He now understood new secrets of the various abilities he had learned from the blue monk, and he discovered a new calmness within his body.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue continued to the green pearl, and the same thing happened once more. But when Hui Yue was about to leave the cave, one thought envelop him. &quot;Devour!&quot; Hui Yue called out as he opened his eyes and a peculiar light shone within.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see.&quot; He muttered to himself, and instead of continuing to the other phenomena, Hui Yue sat down and started meditating on this one word and how it was connected with all his previous lives.</p><p dir="ltr">As the red wolf, Hui Yue had devoured the souls of many humans. He had been an asura which lived in the world of blood and death. The blue monk was also a devourer, but what he devoured was the energies of the world. The blue cloud could devour any energy that one could find. Although Hui Yue had used these energies for a long time, he had never before considered that they were similar in this way.</p><p dir="ltr">The green pearl was the same. It was a devouring power, a power which devoured lifeforce. No matter what Hui Yue thought, he suddenly understood that all the energies were powers which devoured. he had no idea what this meant, but he could vaguely feel that it was very important for him and his further advances as a God.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After contemplating for a longer time, Hui Yue could not get to this notion and why it was so important. In the end, he had no other option than to wait and simply hope that it would reveal itself to him later.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing that he had still not woken up, Hui Yue was at a loss for words. He had already examined all the strange previous lives that he had already merged with, but since he had still not woken up, he left his seated position and headed towards the cave with wings floating inside.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment he reached the cave where the wings were placed, he looked at them with confusion. Behind them was the silhouette of a large human-like figure. This human had wings on his back, and everything was covered in a white light. The being in front of him looked exactly like an angel, and when Hui Yue looked at him, he felt veneration. His heart shook, and he felt as if he had been graced with the presence of a heavenly being.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue touched the wings, and as he did, he felt his entire body overwhelmed with Ancestral Worldpower. It flowed into him from his surroundings seemingly without end. His body felt like one large whirlpool, constantly drawing in more and more energy from the surrounding world.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There was no limit to how much this whirlpool consumed, and it did not stop until there was no energy left within the whole dream world. Hui Yue had absorbed all of it in a short amount of time.</p><p dir="ltr">The wings within Hui Yue&apos;s core had solidified greatly; they were almost so clear that Hui Yue would be able to merge with the memories hidden within the wings and thus strengthen himself further.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue stood up and moved to the next cave. This was the cave of the red gem, the only open cave which Hui Yue had never before entered. He was unaware of what kind of power was contained within.</p><p dir="ltr">As he got closer to this red gem, he saw the silhouette of a massive mountain behind it. A mountain with such an outstanding and imposing aura that pressed down on Hui Yue, it felt as if he were carrying the massive mountain on his shoulders. His entire body trembled, and he was forced a few steps backward as he felt blood well up inside his throat.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at this awe-inspiring mountain, Hui Yue was stunned for words. He gritted his teeth and reached out his hand, ready to touch the red gem. But just before he touched the gem, his eyes opened. He had left the cave-like dream world he had been in before.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, as Hui Yue opened his eyes, he was confused. Everything around him was dark. There was a new moon out, and no light shone through the windows.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even though it was dark, Hui Yue was a God ranked cultivator. His eyes were capable of seeing in the darkness. He quickly noticed that he was within his room, but something felt amiss. His right arm was heavy, and something warm was snuggling up against him.</p><p dir="ltr">Trying to sit up, Hui Yue noticed that it was not possible; something was holding him down, and when he looked to the side, a sigh escaped his lips. A feeling that was hard to describe enveloped him.</p><p dir="ltr">By his side was Huli. She was using his arm as a pillow and had her own arms wrapped around the young man, making it impossible for him to move. In a way, this reminded him of when he had just met Sha Yun. The snake-woman use to love to coil herself around him with her tail. The only difference was that Hui Yue had always been stronger than Sha Yun while Huli was stronger than him, rendering him completely incapable of moving.</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing deeply, Hui Yue spent all his energy to try and move the woman who was snuggled up to him, but no matter how much he tried, she did not budge at all.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, he had no other option than to wait for the day to break and Huli to wake up. He knew that Huli was a God of a rank higher than him. Hui Yue mumbled to himself. He liked Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long, loved them even, but he did not feel that Huli loved him. Still, she was very obsessed with him, and Hui Yue could not figure out the reason.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue did not love Huli, he doted on her and felt a strange feeling of kinship, it was also because of this emotion that he allowed for the willful fox to do as she pleased.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind if it were Sha Yun or Wang Ju Long who were currently laying in my arms&quot; He sighed to himself, but he quickly dispelled all of such thoughts and started planning the next few days. He had a lot which he needed to do.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had to refine his parents&apos; and friends&apos; bodies with the Nirvana Phoenix Flame and also needed to create three Silvermoon Pills.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Thinking about all the things he needed to do, Hui Yue sighed once more and tried to free himself from the fox, but it did not work. Seeing that he had no other option, Hui Yue closed his eyes and started meditating. At his current level of power he would not gain strength by absorbing Ancestral Worldpower from the world, but from gaining further understanding and enlightenment in the various paths one was journeying on.</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue was laying down and contemplating, he could not help but wonder about the word devour. Every life he had regained memories of had something to do with the word devour, and it felt as though it held a hidden meaning to him, yet why? Why was this word so important and what did it signify?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">No matter how much he thought about it, Hui Yue could not come up with an answer. Therefore, after awhile, he started pondering on the various techniques that the dream had highlighted for him. Although he had become a God, it was still possible for him to use the blue cloud, the red beast energy, and lifeforce. These three types of energies should definitely not be looked down upon.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Realizing this, Hui Yue smiled. Although he might not be the strongest God out there, he had some tools at his disposal which allowed for him to raise his rank significantly and which should allow him to fight even some Immortals of Creation on equal footing.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although I understand the attacks much better now, I still need to train them more to become more proficient in using them. I cannot just think and meditate on them; I need to go out and fight. I need to experience hardships so that I can grasp the true meaning behind these attacks!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Still, before I do anything else I need to finish everything I have in mind for this world.&quot; Hui Yue sighed. &quot;I need to make sure that mother, father, and little brother all become King ranked experts. I need to ensure that I am the next Crowned Sovereign, and I have to help all my friends becoming Gods too.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;When all of this has been dealt with, I will go travel through the many worlds, experience hardship and life and death battles. Finding treasures and examining old ruins will hopefully help temper my mind and my body.It should make it possible for me to increase my strength! I need to become the strongest; I need to reach the pinnacle of power!&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
