He was angered from how this youth was talking to him and the humiliation was hard to bear. This youth left no face for the patriarch, but considering that his family had killed three guards of a major sect, it was normal for him to be reprimanded.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the one reprimanding him was this youngster, and this was both humiliating and infuriating. Although he understood that speaking right now would be dumb, he could not help but do so anyways, &quot;Young one, I understand that my family has made a mistake, but for you to be the one to determine what is to be done about it... Do you really think you are suitable?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">His words were somewhat polite, but it was clear for all that he was unhappy with this young man&apos;s interference.</p><p dir="ltr">The two elders and two youngsters looked at one another before suddenly starting to laugh as if this patriarch had said something stupid.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This youth, even if he were to speak in the Celestial Sword Sect, the elders would have to listen to him,&quot; Yang Juan said with a snicker.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This young man is none other than King Chujiang, the Second Judge of Hell, and the person who has caused Diyu and the Celestial Sword Sect to become connected.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Yue is not just anyone,&quot; Gao Li sneered in contempt. &quot;He is a true genius. For you to even speak with him is an honor and the fact that Pei Yue has not already killed your entire family is benevolence!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The way Gao Li spoke made Hui Yue snicker slightly as he was reminded of the first time they met and the way they had bickered as well. There had been no respect, but this respect had grown as time had passed, and now they looked at one another as friends.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The face of the Chen family&apos;s patriarch that was red from anger now seemed like a deflated balloon. All the indignation vanished from his face, and he started trembling in fear instead.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Young master, I deeply apologize for my insulting tone, please forgive this little one. It is not that we do not wish to pay one million Worldpower Stones, but we simply do not have that much money in liquid assets.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh that is no problem, our sect will gladly lend you the stones, and then you pay us back as soon as you have sold some things,&quot; Gao Li said. Truthfully he had no way to determine whether or not the sect would lend the Chen family that much money, but this was a favor for the Second Judge of Hell! Therefore the sect would definitely do so. Especially since it allowed them to limit the power of the Chen family.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chen family was the most influential family within the Heavenly Dragon Gate&apos;s world, and they were not much inferior to the Heavenly Dragon Gate itself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Heavenly Dragon Gate wanted to limit the power of this family before, it had been hard to do so as they always acted carefully. They never insulted anyone and never caused problems. Since they were so well behaved, if the Heavenly Dragon Gate went against them, they would be marked as tyrants who used their size to bully others. Thus the Chen Family had managed to grow unhindered.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Now that there was a chance to severely injure the Chen family both economically and damage their future prospects, it was clear that the Heavenly Dragon Gate was not going to let go of this opportunity. They especially did not want to miss making the Chen family owe them a stunning one million Worldpower Stones.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Chen family patriarch knew exactly what the Heavenly Dragon Gate was thinking, but he could do nothing about it. He had done everything in his power to cause his sect to always lay low until the day they could rival the Heavenly Dragon Gate, but who would have known that his son would mess up in such a massive way. Not only had he insulted the Heavenly Dragon Gate but he had also insulted the Celestial Sword Sect and even a member with connections to Diyu!</p><p dir="ltr">The patriarch was swearing in his mind, feeling as if all the plans he had painstakingly made, were being uprooted in front of him, one after another, by his very own son. He was at the point that he really was willing to sacrifice his son if it meant keeping the Worldpower Stones, but it was too late.</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing, he understood that he had no option other than to accept the punishment he was given, and his eyes brimmed with unshed tears of indignation. His son was the cause of all this!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will have to trouble the noble Heavenly Dragon Gate to help us provide the million Worldpower Stones,&quot; the patriarch said with gritted teeth, accepting the fate of his family. They had once before managed to climb to the strength almost as strong as the Heavenly Dragon Gate, and although they were now experiencing a setback, the patriarch was sure that he would be able to increase the strength of the sect once again.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;About the fate of my son?&quot; He looked at Yang Juan questioningly, but the elder was silent and did not answer. It was clear that he, himself, was unsure of what to do. In one way he wished to kill the young master for the sake of weakening the Chen family, but at the same time, he wondered if he, and the Heavenly Dragon Gate, would be condemned for being too ruthless.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We lost three experts,&quot; Hui Yue suddenly said as he looked into the sky, &quot;three souls lost to the yellow river!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, the patriarch of the Chen family was shocked silly. Hui Yue really was like a death god, looming above his family&apos;s future determining whether or not they would live or die.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he had said that the decision of the life of this young master of the Chen family belonged to Elder Yang Juan, it was clear that Hui Yue wanted him dead.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was usually a calm and collected young man, but one should not misunderstand his friendliness for him being meek and easily bullied. He was not benevolent nor was he forgiving. If someone harmed his friends or family, he would gain revenge tenfold.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">During the time it had taken to travel from the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s World to the world of the Heavenly Dragon Gate, he had become friends with the guards. He had heard about their lives, their families, aspirations, and dreams for the future.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had shared meals with them, joked with them, and teased them. These guards would not have hesitated to give their lives to ensure that Hui Yue was safe, and thus, Hui Yue had already considered them his good friends.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He wanted blood to flow! He wanted the blood of the killer of his friends! He had not been lying when he said that the Worldpower Stones were for the families of the late guards. Although Hui Yue knew that Worldpower Stones would never replace a life, it could still help them in their time of need.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Everyone who touched these guests of the Heavenly Dragon Gate, your son and guards included, shall be given the death penalty for their crimes!&quot; Yang Juan finally declared what would happen with the son, and although he feared that others would think that they were too ruthless, he also understood that they were actually in the right.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Just as the patriarch heard this, his face turned pale. Not only would he lose his son, but he was also losing quite a few capable men that he had expected to rely on, and many members of the younger generation which had joined in the beating of these guards for fun.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These guards all looked at one another as ecstatic expressions appeared on their faces. Their lost brothers would be given justice after all!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We were beaten because we were split up into groups,&quot; one of the guards suddenly said. &quot;Let us go together and show these guards and younger generation what it means to be a member of the Celestial Sword Sect. If the Chen family can bully with their numbers, then so can we!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Get all members of your sect to line up in the courtyard,&quot; Hui Yue ordered, and the patriarch dared not dawdle and waste time. Instead, he did as he was told and gathered everyone in front of the main building.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The guards went through everyone in this courtyard and picked out the ones who had participated in beating them. Everyone was surprised and shocked and completely uncertain about what was happening, and only the ones who had been picked out slowly understood that they had made a mistake. It seemed that the ones they had beaten were people they could not afford to offend.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The patriarch&apos;s heart was aching as he saw one after another of his family members being removed from the courtyard and placed in a group opposite the others. The ones who had been picked out were worried and showed fear on their faces.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s eyes were cold. He felt no pity for these experts. They had killed and beaten his friends; they deserved to die.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The young master who was in secluded meditation was also fetched.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Father, I told you that not to interrupt me. What was so important that you had to trouble me?!&quot; he exclaimed as he came stomping towards his father, but his feet stopped halfway through the courtyard as he sensed that something was wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking around, he noticed the ninety-seven guards, the elders, and the two youths and his face turned slightly pale, but he quickly adjusted. He was the young master of the Chen family! They were ranked almost as high as the Heavenly Dragon Gate, and thus he did not fear for his life. If anything, he would be punished lightly for what he had done.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are young master Chen?&quot; Hui Yue suddenly asked, his voice cold as a killing intent erupted from his body causing the temperature of the entire area to drop.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the weaker cultivators collapsed due to the killing intent alone; even the somewhat stronger experts felt pressure from it, and young master Chen started to feel that something was truly wrong.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Tha... That is me,&quot; he said carefully while trying to probe Hui Yue&#x2019;s strength, yet no matter how much he tried, it was impossible for him to get clues about how strong this young cultivator truly was.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Go stand with the other group over there,&quot; Hui Yue said as he pointed towards the group of experts that was rapidly growing as the guards walked through the members of the Chen family and found the culprits.</p><p dir="ltr">Yang Juan was split between happiness and unhappiness as he saw how many people were being gathered up. Killing this many was going to ensure that the Chen family became no threat to them, but at the same time, it would also ensure that there would be gossip about the Heavenly Dragon Gate using their power to bully others.</p><p dir="ltr">As the final person had been gathered, Hui Yue moved towards them smiling sinisterly as he cracked his neck from side to side. He activated both the dao of space and his dao of devouring.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let me tell you what will happen now,&quot; Hui Yue said with a big grin on his face. &quot;You&#x2019;ve killed members of my Celestial Sword Sect, and you beat up members of my Celestial Sword Sect! Now acknowledge your crimes and surrender your lives!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">When these experts heard that it was the Celestial Sword Sect they had challenged, their faces turned ashen and their eyes widened. Some wanted to scream out, others wanted to flee, but before anyone had the chance to do anything, Hui Yue activated his dao of space and locked everyone where they stood trapping them.</p><p dir="ltr">It was time for him to display a signature attack from one of his previous lives and extinguish these expert&apos;s flame of life.</p><br></div><p></p>
