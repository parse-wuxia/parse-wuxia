One friend of Hui Yue&#x2019;s after another arrived at the City of Endless Clouds and got ready for the departure that was looming around the corner.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had contemplated contacting Yanluo through the communication orb to hear what exactly was happening, but every time his curiosity almost got the better of him he held back.</p><p dir="ltr">It had now been more than fifty years since he had left Diyu, and in all this time, Yanluo had never tried contacting him. If he felt that Hui Yue needed to know what was happening, it was clear that he could have talked with him through the orb, but he had elected not to. Either it was something they had to discuss face to face or Yanluo felt it unnecessary to contact him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Either way, Hui Yue knew that he would likely gain nothing by contacting Yanluo and thus it would just be a waste of time.</p><p dir="ltr">Asking Wei was similarly a waste of time. This guard had been away from Diyu for as long as Hui Yue, and it was highly unlikely that he had been contacted when he himself had not.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Since it was like this, Hui Yue decided to no longer trouble himself with what might have happened, and instead, he focused on rushing around the City of Endless Clouds to gather all the things he needed for the trip.</p><p dir="ltr">Although they were officially just going to Diyu, Hui Yue knew that both he and Lan Feng were incredibly close to becoming Immortals of Creation. Since that was the case, it was also obvious that their trip would not lead them back to the Celestial Sword Sect anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had nurtured the soul of Wang Ju Long once a month with the Nirvana Phoenix Flame, and slowly but surely she had started to become stronger and stronger. Yet her soul was like it was sleeping. As long as she had no body, she would never again awaken. Thankfully, the wounds she had received had long since been healed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Lan Feng was someone whom Hui Yue considered a brother. His brother had lived within his body for so long. Hui Yue wished to create a body for him as soon as possible so that he could once again become complete and feel the freedom of controlling his own body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Ever since Xiao She, the snake woman, had appeared in the City of Endless Clouds, Hui Yue felt how Lan Feng had become agitated.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He would feel happiness one moment and sadness the next. He wasn&apos;t sure whether he was happy to be close to her once more, or sad that he could not hold her as he wished. Sad that he could no longer be with her, talk with her, and pursue her like he used to.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing that Lan Feng had such emotions, Hui Yue and Lan Feng were both even more motivated to cultivate; they wished to become as strong as possible so that they could find the Alchemist God, and when they found him, they would start a new chapter in their lives.</p><p dir="ltr">But before they had the confidence to find the Alchemist God, they needed to become Immortals of Creation. It was clear that this was their first step towards their goal, and thus they would work as hard as they could.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are all here,&quot; Hui Yue looked at everyone in front of the pagoda. Cai Jie had just arrived as the final member of their team, and the captain of Yanluo&apos;s guards looked at the group of misfits that Hui Yue had gathered.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The group was truly strange. All of them were obviously immortals, some Immortals of Creation, others Primordial Immortals. Some were beasts; others were humans.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Some were so strong that the captain could hardly breathe in fear of them being displeased while others were only as strong as average Immortals of Creation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Before we start our tour could everyone make a brief introduction?&quot; The captain asked with a friendly smile on his face, and everyone looked at one another before shrugging their shoulders and agreeing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In that case, allow me to begin,&quot; Wan Qiao was the first to volunteer. She had been one of the last people to follow Hui Yue, but now she was certain that she had made the right decision.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She had been stuck at the peak of the Saint rank for so many years. It had been impossible for her to improve on her own and she had already resigned herself to a life where the Divine Beast World was all she would see.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had appeared like a shining star in her world. He had given her a chance to see a much grander stage. A place that was filled with powerhouses, and not only this, he had allowed for her to become one of these powerhouses. Although she was still only a Primordial Immortal right now, she knew that she would one day become as fearsome as the others in their group. As long as she followed Hui Yue she had a feeling that she would be safe.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Wan Qiao. I am a One-Horned Jasmine Eagle. I focus on the dao of light and so far I have comprehended ten daos.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Ten daos might not sound like a lot, but it was quite a fast progress considering that Wan Qiao was the last to leave the Formation of Life. She had been the last to become a God, and thus she was the weakest amongst them all. Despite this, she had still comprehended ten full daos! This made her stronger than the average Immortal of Creation, especially those who had advanced solely by means of Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Xiao She,&quot; The snake-woman decided to introduce herself next. &quot;I am, as you can see, a lamia. I specialize in the dao of earth, and I am a little more than halfway through the minor daos!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Her face was filled with pride. Xiao She was already an Immortal of Creation, but she had become one because she had absorbed massive quantities of Ancestral Worldpower, not because she had comprehended a major dao. Therefore, she was not one of the strongest Immortals of Creation around. But despite this, her daos were coming along nicely, and she had also done well in the years she had practiced in her guardian sect.</p><p dir="ltr">A large burly man who seemed to be around two and a half meters tall suddenly stepped forward. With every step he took, the ground shook underneath him. He gave a curt bow to the captain with a face that was completely stern and straight. He did not display any of his emotions at all.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am He Yong, a Three-Horned Rhinoceros. I also focus on the dao of earth, and I have comprehended a little more than Xiao She has so far.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing him speak, it was clear that he was rather proud of his accomplishments. It was obvious that he felt he had done great, all the while Xiao She was sulking to the side. Hui Yue understood that these two most likely competed against one another.</p><p dir="ltr">When that thought crossed his mind, he felt a tinge of pain in his chest. He could not help but sigh. It was clear that Lan Feng was jealous. He wished that he could be the one to have such a relationship with Xiao She, but he also understood that it was impossible with how things were now. At least he was grown up enough to not blame He Yong for anything.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My turn!&quot; a bright voice sounded as young, skinny-looking man with a constant smirk on his face appeared in front of the others. Looking at him, he seemed like a trickster.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Shen Wei, a jackal! I focus on the dao of darkness and have currently comprehended quite a few. I have a great affinity for the dao of darkness so I should have control of the major dao within a few years!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Every God of the beast Gods from the red realm had become Immortals of Creation. Some had already broken through back in the red realm, while the others had been on the verge of breaking through. Therefore, during the last fifty years, they had successfully broken through.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although it was like this and their strength had increased, none of them had become complacent. They had all finally understood the meaning and purpose of the dao, and they now knew just how badly they were lacking.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, they all worked incredibly hard and did everything in their power to be able to comprehend a major dao. Only then would they feel somewhat safe and useful for the future tasks they were going to undertake.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My name is Tang Tian. It is a pleasure to meet you all,&quot; a gentle looking man said. He looked to be around the twenty years old. He had long silver hair and silver eyes. &quot;I am a flood dragon, and I specialize in the dao of water. I started by comprehending the dao of inferno long ago but found that the dao of water is much more suitable for me. Because of this, I am now only a step away from having comprehended the major dao of water.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The truth was that Tang Tian was as close to breaking through as Hui Yue and Lan Feng were. He only needed to understand a couple more daos, and he was frighteningly fast at comprehending the dao. His natural talent was in no way inferior to Hui Yue and Lan Feng, and his affinity with water was so outstanding that Hui Yue was certain that he had an amazing bloodline hidden within him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Lu Shing, a three-headed dog,&quot; a small boy suddenly spoke. When one looked at him, no one would imagine that he was a ferocious beast, but the truth was that he always took the shape of a small boy whenever he transformed into a human shape, much to his own dismay. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I focus on the dao of fire, and I am a little more than halfway to comprehending the full dao.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Lu Shing did not speak more, there was simply no reason for him to say more, and thus, he kept quiet. Although he liked talking with friends, this was an introduction about their fight capacity to his comrades so that they knew what they could expect from them when it came to a battle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was obvious that no one present would mention which daos they had comprehended. The captain only needed to have a vague understanding of their power, to fully understand them was something they would never allow since the captain was not a part of their group.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Jia Na, a sea serpent so to speak. I obviously specialize in the dao of water, and I am a little more than three-fourths of the way to comprehending the full major dao.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Yan Lei, a black turtle and I focus on both the dao of earth and the dao of water. I am aware of the disadvantages of focusing on two daos at once, however, using the two together is my specialty.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Zhong Li, a Qilin. I specialize in the dao of metal. This is a dao that not many specialize in, but I feel rather confident in my own ability.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am Mu Haolong, a Hell Bull. I focus on the dao of fire, and I am almost at the point where I have comprehended the full dao of fire.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">With that every one of the beasts had introduced themselves and the captain&apos;s gaze fell on the humans next. &#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
