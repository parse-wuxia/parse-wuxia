A place filled with ancient worlds that could collapse at any time but also somewhere one could find countless opportunities and treasures. It was a world where danger and opportunity went hand in hand.</p><p>Unfortunately, being in the Archaic World did not just depend on strength but also one&#x2019;s luck. Luck was something that was impossible to control, and thinking of adventuring through the countless worlds that resided in this area of space made Hui Yue&apos;s heart palpitate.</p><p>Still, his eyes glistened with expectation. Although he knew it would be quite dangerous, he was not going to back down. He needed to find the Alchemist God, and he was willing to risk his life to do so.</p><p>&apos;Since it is like this, we cannot force the others to follow us,&apos; Lan Feng sighed, and Hui Yue nodded his head. &quot;It&#x2019;s too dangerous. I will ask if they want to go with us or return to the guardian sects and train more.&quot;</p><p>Although he wished for his friends to go with him, he also understood that the chances of survival in such a place were likely to be below fifty percent. They were all friends he cared for deeply, and he would never force them into such dangerous situations. Only those who felt like joining should join him on this trip.</p><p>&quot;I actually told you the truth because I hoped to dissuade you from looking for the Alchemist God, but I can sense that I was not successful,&quot; King Chujiang said regretfully. &#x201C;Since that is the case let me give you some good advice,&quot; he continued.</p><p>&quot;Worlds that are about to collapse will have a very chaotic energy around them. Their Ancestral Worldpower will be twisting and churning as if it is being ignited by the world itself. Small explosions will happen as the energy is compressed and finally cannot handle the pressure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I knew that the world I entered was breaking, but I continued because I saw an absolutely top-tier treasure. It was a sentient storage treasure, and such a thing is almost unheard of. Only in the Archaic World are you able to find sentient weapons, treasures, items, and so on.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, it dawned on Hui Yue that his Universe Box hailed from the Archaic World. Thinking about this, he wondered if there was a way to get information about the Archaic World if he just traded enough storage treasures to the Universe box. So far it had always agreed to sell information and items for the sake of storage treasures.</p><p>Hui Yue was deep in thought, and no one disturbed him. Only after ten minutes did he return to his senses and sent a genuine smile to King Chujiang.</p><p>&quot;You have done me a great favor,&quot; he said seriously. &quot;Not only have you told me about where I can find the Alchemist God, but you have also provided me with some important information about how to survive in this place filled with old, dying worlds.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue was genuinely happy with the information he had obtained, and he did not mind telling the older man that he considered this as one of the favors repaid. Although it was beneficial to have Diyu owe him, Hui Yue was not greedy. He understood when someone was helping him, and this was something he would always be grateful for.</p><p>&quot;This is nothing compared to what you have done for me,&quot; King Chujiang chuckled. He had a great impression of this young man in front of him, and if possible, he hoped that he could stay in Diyu as part of their strength.</p><p>However, King Chujiang was not stupid. He had long since understood that Hui Yue was definitely going to look for the Alchemist God. Since this was the case, all he could do was hope that this youngster would return home safely.</p><p>&quot;It seems that you are feeling well,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile as he bowed to King Chujiang. &quot;I will retire and leave you to recuperate. If there are any injuries to your soul, do not hesitate to call for me. I will come running with another wisp of Nirvana Phoenix Flame, but I think your soul is completely healed now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Should you need anything from me, then you are always welcome to find me, but I will be leaving Diyu shortly. I need to go talk with my friends and see if any of them wants to come to the Archaic World with me,&quot; Hui Yue said straightforwardly.</p><p>&quot;Hearing how dangerous this place is, I do not wish to force anyone to join me. If they are worried for their lives, I want them to stay behind and train more. Since this is the case, can I request that they stay here in Diyu? I will of course provide them with the cultivation resources they need.&quot;</p><p>Hearing what Hui Yue said, Yanluo and the others chuckled. &quot;They can stay if they wish to do so, however, don&apos;t underestimate your friends,&quot; Yanluo said seriously. &quot;All of them have been ready to go through hell and back for you, just because your next step is more dangerous than before, don&apos;t look down on them or think that they will chicken out.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue felt a little embarrassed and scratched his head, but in the end, he opted to say nothing. Although they were very good friends of his, the beasts had decided to follow him due to him having gained the legacy of the Vermilion Bird and because he was the Crowned Sovereign of the Beast World. Was this really enough of a connection for them to risk their lives?</p><p>Hui Yue did not know, but deep within his heart, he was hoping that all of them would follow him when he went to the Archaic World.</p><p>&quot;Well don&#x2019;t worry, Wei will follow you. I already ordered him to stay by your side; he will not disobey orders. From what I know, he is enjoying adventuring with you,&quot; Yanluo laughed.</p><p>Bowing once more, Hui Yue said his thanks then turned around and left. On the way back he found his communication orb and contacted everyone, telling them to gather in his chambers.</p><p>It did not take long before they were all gathered in his room, and Hui Yue smiled as he saw them.</p><p>&quot;King Chujiang has been successfully resurrected,&quot; he started, and his words caused everyone to be at a loss. Although this was important news, was it really necessary to gather them all up for it?</p><p>Guessing everyone&apos;s thoughts, Hui Yue smiled. &quot;The reason I&#x2019;ve gathered everyone here is because I gained some information from him. The reason he died was because he went to an area called the Archaic World.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Archaic World is a group of ancient worlds which were the first to be created in this galaxy. They contain treasures beyond our wildest imagination and also dangers that we cannot begin to understand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The reason that King Chujiang went to this place was because he was looking for his good friend the Alchemist God!&quot;</p><p>When the words left Hui Yue&apos;s mouth, everyone was deeply shocked. They were all looking for the Alchemist God, but looking for one God in the entire galaxy was the same as looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Since they were not the first group to look for him, it was likely that they could get some pointers.</p><p>But while everyone was filled with happiness and excitement, Hui Yue&apos;s face turned slightly downcast. It did not take long for everyone to notice that something was not right, and they stopped their conversations.</p><p>&quot;What is wrong?&quot; Deng Wu asked concerned. Hui Yue was the one who was most obsessed with finding the Alchemist God, but it seemed as if it was not even making him happy to know where he was likely to be hiding.</p><p>Hui Yue smiled wryly. &quot;It&#x2019;s not that I am not excited like the rest of you,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;It&#x2019;s just that this is going to be the most dangerous trip we have ever encountered so far.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In most places strength is everything. Strength should be able to protect us all, but in this place, luck also matters greatly. If we are lucky then we will all come back alive, if we are not lucky, then we might never return.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I feel terrible knowing that the strength I have spent so long gaining might not be able to protect us,&quot; he said while shaking his head. &quot;Because of this, I want all of you to consider if you want to join me on this trip. There is a very high probability that we will not be able to return, and since this is the case, I do not want to force anyone to follow me.&quot;</p><p>Silence descended on the room, and no one spoke, but quite a few of them frowned. Deng Wu sighed and stepped forward.</p><p>He did not stop before he was standing right in front of a confused Hui Yue, and suddenly Deng Wu lifted his hand and smacked Hui Yue on the top of his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Idiot!&#x201D; He exclaimed. &#x201C;Are we not brothers? Have we not all sworn to follow you to the ends of the world knowing full well it may cost us our lives? We will travel with you. Although it is dangerous, we have braved many dangers before. We will not be there for treasure hunting so we will keep out of the dangerous realms and worlds.&#x201D;</p><p>&quot;Yeah! We have trained for more than fifty years because we wish to be of use to you!&quot; Shen Wei joined in, and soon all of them said what was on their minds.</p><p>&quot;We would have died in the red realm without you coming to save us!&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you hadn&apos;t brought me out of the Divine Beast World, my life would have been wasted as a Saint for the rest of my life. I never would have experienced all this,&quot; Wan Qiao also joined in.</p><p>&quot;Maybe my brother is there,&quot; Rong Xing said with a small smile on her face. &quot;I need to look for him everywhere, why not start in the Archaic World?&quot;</p><p>More and more stood up, their hearts filled with excitement about this new adventure, and all of them stated why they wanted to join Hui Yue on his trip.</p><p>&quot;Everywhere father goes, I will follow,&quot; Lao stated as a matter of fact, and Jo just smiled. Sighing Hui Lei shook his head, &quot;you are my older brother, it is only natural for me to follow you, not to mention someone has to protect my dear Jo from danger.&quot;</p><p>Hearing everyone&apos;s heartfelt words, Hui Yue felt warm inside. A small smile bloomed on his face like a flower in springtime, and he felt great joy from having such loyal friends.</p><p>&quot;I will do everything in my power to ensure that we will all be able to return successful!&quot; he swore, and everyone nodded their heads.</p><p>&quot;If you do everything you can, then we will do everything we can to assist you. If we die, then so be it. We have already experienced much more than what we had ever expected. We have moved forward from where we were trapped for years, and if we were to truly die, we could die with no regrets!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Danger and rewards go hand in hand,&quot; Wei suddenly said, his eye glistening. &quot;Although this will be dangerous, many travel to the Archaic World every day to try and get their hands on treasure. I suggest that we get some information first on the Archaic World. Many places sell information and when we get that we will be even more prepared for what we might encounter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Collapsing worlds are not the only danger on our trip, there are ancient beasts, traps and dangerous formations and inscriptions. There might even be remnant souls wandering about. We need to be prepared for everything, but at the same time, all of us will benefit greatly from this trip. If we return, we should become a true force to be reckoned with!&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
