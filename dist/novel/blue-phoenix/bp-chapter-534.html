None of the experts following them came closer than they were now, and Hui Yue, who spent the whole night observing these three experts, was excited to fight against them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the sun rose in the sky, Hui Yue, Huli, and Cai Jie were all covered by Hui Yue&apos;s soulforce while the beast Gods looked at one another and flew away from them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment they flew into the distance the group of pursuers started following behind them. At first, they seemed hesitant to move, but after sensing that the group of Gods was not slowing down, they finally started moving.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, Huli, and Cai Jie were all covered by soulforce, so currently it was impossible to sense them.</p><p dir="ltr">Huli instantly intercepted the first person to arrive. He arrived quickly because he was only ten kilometers behind them, but the moment he was caught his face turned ashen.</p><p dir="ltr">The two experts behind him instantly stopped when they felt the vibrations from the first expert being blocked. Hui Yue, who was still in the forest followed their movements. If they attempted to flee, then Hui Yue and Cai Jie would be the ones to chase them. They wanted to get rid of whomever it was that had been following them.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue and Cai Jie both got ready to fly after the ones who had stopped, but then suddenly Hui Yue noticed the two experts that had stopped before were moving towards the ground where Huli and the other expert was located.</p><p dir="ltr">By now Huli was fighting the expert that had been following behind them, and since she was much stronger than her opponent, it was almost impossible for her to lose this fight. Even though she was many times stronger than the other expert, she was not complacent. She knew that another two experts were hiding somewhere and she could not allow them to sneak up on her.</p><p dir="ltr">It took less than a minute for the two other experts to reach the location and their eyes swept across the two fighting cultivators.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Where is the expert from the Celestial Sword Sect?&quot; One of the arriving experts asked with a loud voice shocking everyone present.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing their question, Huli narrowed her eyes while the other expert that had already been stopped tried to escape.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are a nuisance,&quot; the second expert that had just arrived sighed. With a wave of his hand, a beam of light shot out and penetrated between the two eyes of the expert Huli had been fighting against. Two drops of blood slipped out, and the expert plummeted from the skies to the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We need to stop them!&quot; Hui Yue said with worry in his voice, and Cai Jie could only agree. These two experts were many times stronger than what they had expected, and Huli alone might not be able to deal with them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Flying into the air, Hui Yue&apos;s face was dark, and his Ancestral Worldpower rushed through his body ready to be unleashed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment Hui Yue appeared the two experts looked at him, and without hesitation, both bowed down.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Young master, Fu Ziyu and Fu Jinyan announce their arrival. Young master Pei Ze told us to protect young master until the sect has decided what to do.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Young master, please allow Fu Ziyu and Fu Jinyan to follow you towards Diyu.&quot; The second person said politely, and while both of them straightened their backs, everyone was completely shocked by the words they heard. Who was Pei Ze? Who were these two Fu brothers? Which sect were they from?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the confusion on Hui Yue&apos;s face, the two Fu brothers looked at one another before they sighed. The one who called himself Fu Ziyu opened his mouth once again.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are guardians of the Celestial Sword Sect. We are not allowed to be direct disciples as our bloodline does not contain the blood of the great roc, but we are allowed to be protectors of the sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We were following young master Pei Ze on his trip to Diyu. However, when he saw you at the banquet in Skydragon Fortress, he ordered us, lowly guardians, to protect you. Master Pei Ze easily noticed the killing intent in the City Lord&apos;s eyes, and thus he sent half of his own guards to protect young master.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Young master, please allow us to know young master&apos;s name,&quot; Fu Jinyan said with a low voice, and Hui Yue who understood their question could not help but be slightly surprised. Seeing these two experts, he was unsure if he should trust them. They seemed reasonable, and they also seemed very respectful. In spite of this, there was a possibility that they were faking it to attack them when they were less focused on them. Because of this, he was still on high alert as he looked at the two guards.</p><p dir="ltr">Sensing his doubt and the fact that he did not trust them, Fu Ziyu and Fu Jinyan looked at each other, &quot;I swear on the dao of the heavens that I am here to protect young master,&quot; they both swore. Hui Yue who did not know about a dao oath looked rather silly while the expressions on the two other Gods, Huli, and Cai Jie, turned much better.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, understanding that something good had happened, looked at the two and smiled gently. &quot;Please don&apos;t blame me for being careful,&quot; he said in a friendly voice. &quot;I am just worried that you are here to kill me. I do not know your sect nor do I have any strong sect supporting me. I made it to the God rank by trusting and supporting myself so hearing that a sect has taken interest in me is far beyond my expectations. Especially that a sect would like to assist me, it is very unexpected.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The two guards nodded their heads. Although one did not make an oath on the heavenly daos lightly, they could understand where this young man was coming from so they did not mind making an oath to put his mind at ease.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My name is Hui Yue,&quot; Hui Yue said without trying to hide his name. &quot;If you wish to travel with us then we would be very honored,&quot; he continued, and the two Fu brothers nodded their heads quickly accepting the offer.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I was wondering,&quot; Fu Ziyu suddenly hesitated before he continued to ask. &quot;You were able to sense us even though you were not anywhere close to us. The only reason you could sense us is if you have soulforce, could you tell us, guardians, if this is the case?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, an expert would not answer such questions unless they could fully trust the ones they told, but these two guards had already sworn an oath to protect him, and thus he hesitated and wondered if he should tell them. In the end, because he had hesitated it was obvious so he decided to tell them. With a mocking smile on his face he said, &quot;Yes, I possess soulforce,&quot; causing the eyes of the two guards to light up.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One of the guards instantly took out a massive orb which shone with light, and after pouring some Ancestral Worldpower into this orb, the face of one of the young masters from the City Lord&apos;s banquet appeared within.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Why are you contacting me Fu Ziyu?&quot; he asked grumpily, &quot;did something happen with that young man you are protecting?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">His voice was clear and straightforward, and although it was rude to himself, he did not seem to mind.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Young Master we were noticed by the new young master,&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;The new young master happens to have soulforce and was capable of locating us even though we stayed quite a distance away. We will follow the new young master and his group to ensure that they do not encounter any danger before reaching Diyu. When we get there, then young master Pei Ze can introduce him to the rest of the sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze&apos;s face which had seemed carefree at first turned surprised and then his eyes widened as he heard Fu Ziyu&apos;s words.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You say that he can use soulforce?&quot; He asked. Although he was sure that this was what Fu Ziyu had said, he had to ask again to make sure.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Fu Ziyu announces to young master Pei Ze that new young master indeed controls soulforce alongside the dao of space. Fu Ziyu wishes to congratulate young master Pei Ze for having noticed such an outstanding individual.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">While Fu Ziyu was speaking with Pei Ze, Hui Yue watched from the side and was greatly shocked by their conversation. He had never expected that someone would speak so bluntly about himself right next to him, and he was rather curious about this orb he was using.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Fu Ziyu, you are to ensure that this new young master reaches Diyu. You can die but he cannot. He is to arrive unhurt so that I can introduce him to our masters. They will be very eager to meet this young man,&quot; Pei Ze finally said.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Pei Ze was a genius of the younger generation, he was also a member of the Celestial Sword Sect. Being a member of the Celestial Sword Sect, he would do anything to make the sect grow. Gaining a supreme expert would solidify their position as a major sect within the galaxy, and he would reap great merits by introducing this genius to the sect.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, he was very eager. As soon as the conversation ended with Fu Ziyu, Pei Ze looked into the white ball in his hand. He hesitated for a short while before he poured his Ancestral Worldpower into the ball and waited for the reply.</p><p dir="ltr">It did not take long before an elderly man appeared in the glass ball.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Ze why do you contact me? Hurry to Diyu so that you can participate in the trial and don&apos;t waste time! You have been given six guards so there shouldn&#x2019;t be any problems for you.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Grand elder, excuse Pei Ze for contacting you, however, I have come across a genius of our sect who has come from a lawbreaker.&quot; Pei Ze said respectfully.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I met him at the City Lord of Skydragon Fortress&#x2019;s banquet. He controls the dao of space, and he also has soulforce! He has the most brilliant wings I have seen in a very long time, but he is unaware of what the Celestial Sword Sect is. I have sent the Fu brothers to look after him, and they are heading to Diyu now. They are taking a long way to avoid bandits, and thus I will be there when he arrives.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although I will be there soon, I felt like this was something that I needed to share with you and the other elders. His parents clearly broke the rule and left the sect, but I have no idea who his parents are. But even so, his potential is amazing! He will be a great asset to our sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The grand elder within the ball was quiet for a long time. After thinking about what he had heard for a whole ten minutes, the elder finally nodded his head, &quot;I will speak with the other elders about this young man. You did the right thing to send the Fu brothers to defend him. Just the dao of space alone would be enough to make us welcome him with open arms and the same goes for his control over soulforce. To have both, we will definitely want to reel him in no matter what.&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
