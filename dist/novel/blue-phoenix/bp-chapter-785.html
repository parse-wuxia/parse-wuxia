Blood welled up their throats, and an enormous explosion ensued enveloping the battlefield for tens of kilometers.</p><p>The collision caused the half-step Overlord to be stunned, his head felt like an egg being cracked, and his vision turned blurry.</p><p>In that moment, he lost all the momentum he had been gathering, and even the attack he was about to launch was interrupted while his opponent smirked. The human half-step Overlord used the opportunity to launch his own deadly attack. He merged it with all the Archaic Energy that he possessed and neatly severed his opponents head from his neck.</p><p>He knew that he owed these two experts thanks, and he flew to see the two experts that had given him this heaven-sent opportunity.</p><p>The human half-step Overlord had been losing, but he managed to turn the entire situation around because of one attack from Lan Feng and Hui Yue so naturally, he wished to express his gratitude to them.</p><p>It required some astonishing bravery to interfere in a battle between two half-step Overlords for someone who had yet to reach the same rank, but they had still done so.</p><p>The human cultivator reached the two experts that were still slightly dizzy and consuming one pill after another while bleeding from their orifices. Their eyes had bloody tears, and blood was flowing from their ears in steady streams. There was even blood seeping out from beneath their nails. In short, they were in horrible shape.</p><p>Their bodies looked to be charred. Some places flesh wounds could be seen while in other places their bones were completely visible.</p><p>Lan Feng was a blue phoenix, but right now he looked more like a barbequed chicken. Most of his feathers had been burned off and there were horrible wounds all over his body.</p><p>&quot;Dammit,&quot; he swore. His words startling the half-step Overlord who was observing them curiously. &quot;If I knew my feathers would be burnt like this, I would never have suggested that stupid attack!&quot; he complained, completely ignoring the gashes all over their bodies, the parts of missing flesh, and the constant ringing in their ears. All that mattered to him was the fact that he had lost his beautiful feathers.</p><p>Hui Yue, who was in an even more miserable state than Lan Feng just laughed out loud when he heard his brother speak.</p><p>&quot;You are so vain! Even in a situation like this, all that matters to you is your beauty!&quot; He grinned, but he had to admit that he was feeling much better than a second ago.</p><p>&quot;I can&#x2019;t help it, I am beautiful by nature. No other creature can hold a candle to my appearance, yet here I am, completely without my feathered might. If Xiao She sees me like this she will run away!&quot; he exclaimed.</p><p>The half-step Overlord was shocked. These two experts were close to death, at least their bodies were, but they were joking as if they had nothing to lose.</p><p>&quot;Ahem,&quot; clearing his throat, the human supreme expert made his appearance known, and both Lan Feng and Hui Yue turned to look at him.</p><p>&quot;I would like to thank you for giving me a great opportunity to take the head of that demon,&quot; he said at first, and both Hui Yue and Lan Feng nodded their heads. &quot;No problem,&quot; Hui Yue answered.</p><p>&quot;I can see that your bodies will not last much longer,&quot; the half-step Overlord said with a frown. &quot;Why don&apos;t you take these pills. They will boost your bodies strength for a while, but after two days, they will decompose.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that two days is not a lot of time, but in your current state... I don&apos;t think you will even be able to last two days. This pill draws on the energy within the body, so if it is a higher ranked body, it will make the pill more effective than a lower ranked body. That is all I can offer you as a repayment for the opportunity you gave me.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue and Lan Feng&apos;s eyes shone when they heard this. This was exactly the kind of pill they were needing. Hui Yue knew that they existed but he had never made them before because he had too much faith in their refined bodies. But now that their bodies were on the verge of collapsing, they really needed some pills that could push out the energy that they were refined from and convert it to strength.</p><p>It was true that their bodies would not last for two days with the wounds they had received, but even if they could just fight for one more day, then that was better than where they were now. If they did nothing they would probably be forced to leave behind their bodies within moments.</p><p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed, and the half-step Overlord smiled as he tossed two pills to the cultivators. &quot;I won&apos;t hold you back any longer,&quot; he said. &quot;Although my fight is done, I need to assist the other two so that we can go and help Yama.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know Yama is proud, but that Blood Demon Overlord is not easy to deal with. He will need all of our help!&quot;</p><p>Having said this, he rushed towards the location of Yanluo and the Manor Lord that he was fighting.</p><p>Lan Feng and Hui Yue looked at one another and grinned before they popped the pills into their mouths. They instantly felt their bodies heat up. Every wound was healed, and they were bursting with energy in no time.</p><p>This energy was like an overflowing current coming from an never-ending source.</p><p>Although their bodies were in poor shape before, they were still refined bodies. They had been refined by the most amazing materials, and as a result, they were filled with enormous amounts of energy. Now that this energy was being drawn out, it was truly a magnificent sight.</p><p>&quot;Well, we need to go help the others,&quot; Lan Feng sighed, and Hui Yue nodded his head. &quot;I am going to check up on my wives,&quot; he added. &quot;You should take a look at Xiao She to ensure that she is still safe.&quot;</p><p>Lan Feng nodded his head. Although the two of them were brothers, and even though they shared a soul, it was not as if they had to follow each other everywhere.</p><p>They had managed to get revenge against An He, and they had managed to get rid of the Blood Demon that the four divine beasts had fought against before. This could already be considered astonishing feats in their own right.</p><p>Now that they had taken down the worst opponents, only the easier ones were left, and they could manage these on their own. There was really no reason to move around together.</p><p>Hui Yue and Lan Feng quickly split up. Lan Feng flew towards the area where the humans and the Blood Demons were colliding in his attempt to locate Xiao She while Hui Yue rather quickly located Wang Ju Long.</p><p>She had been busy killing demons. Many Blood Demons had already fallen to her hand, and she kept killing more and more experts. The ground underneath her was already a mountain of corpses.</p><p>&quot;Ju Long,&quot; Hui Yue called out, &quot;We are going to find the others.&quot;</p><p>Wang Ju Long instantly turned around and came to Hui Yue&apos;s side. She would follow him through thick and thin, hell and high waters without question, and since he said they were going to find the others, she would gladly follow him. It also meant that the most dangerous part was over.</p><p>Wang Ju Long knew that the battle against the Overlords was something that they could not join, and none of the heavenly dao cultivators could prove challenging for Hui Yue with the amount of energy that was surging through his body.</p><p>Just as they looked around, Hui Yue saw that Cai Jie was in a desperate situation again. He was now alone, but he had once more gone deeper into enemy lines than what was wise. He was fighting against seven Blood Demons at once, and all of them were equal to him in strength. It seemed he had been fighting for some time and Hui Yue could see the wounds covering his body.</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s smile faded and his eyes turned serious as he saw that all seven of these demons were raising their weapons ready to make the final, deadly attack against Cai Jie.</p><p>&quot;No!&quot; Hui Yue yelled out and flew at the speed of light to his side. The dao of the heavens spread out, and it was as if heaven itself descended upon the cultivators. The weight was impossible to withstand and all seven exploded on sight.</p><p>At that moment, the drop of blood within Hui Yue inner self stirred. He saw Cai Jie was safe, wounded rather badly, but safe, and the drop of blood trembled in relief.</p><p>The drop cracked open, and from the inside, a blood-red silhouette walked out. This silhouette was the memories of Hui Yue&apos;s previous life, and although they were in the middle of the battlefield, Hui Yue knew he had to merge with them as soon as possible.</p><p>&quot;Ju Long, guard us,&quot; he requested, and Wang Ju Long nodded her head. With her here, no one would be able to interrupt neither Hui Yue nor Cai Jie.</p><p>Cai Jie had sat down to consume even more pills to heal his body and restore his Ancestral Worldpower while Hui Yue was reaching out to touch the memory.</p><p>As his fingers came into contact with the blood-red figure, he suddenly felt as if he had fallen down a massive red maelstrom.</p><p>Everywhere he looked, red was swirling around him. As for how long he was within this swirling red world, Hui Yue did not know. On one hand, it had felt like forever, but on the other, it had felt like it was only a second.</p><p>Hui Yue experienced being born in an immortal city. He experienced growing up and getting to know Cai Jie. He experienced everything that he had once before been told by Cai Jie himself, about how they had lived a rough life but promised one another to be brothers forever.</p><p>He experienced how they were chased by An He, and how he had died by An He&#x2019;s hands while saving his brother.</p><p>Merging with these memories did not bring Hui Yue any new abilities, any new daos, or any new comprehension, but he gained peace of mind.</p><p>He had for a long time guessed that this life was Cai Jie&apos;s brother. There had been a strange intuition that had told him so, but now that it had proven to be right, he felt calm. Cai Jie was his brother in his old life and his new one. This was something that could never be changed, but it was one thing hearing about their memories together, and quite another reliving them. Now he understood exactly how terrible it had to have been for Cai Jie when Hui Yue had died back then.</p><p>Unfortunately, now was not the time to enjoy a heartfelt reunion, and when Hui Yue opened his eyes, he gave Cai Jie a long glance but noticed that he was already standing, ready to fight more demons.</p><p>&quot;Come with us,&quot; Hui Yue said, &quot;We are going to gather up some of the others, and you can fight with us together. That is much safer than being on your own. Leave your back to someone you trust.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue did not ask about why Cai Jie was alone now, neither did he ask anything about who had died so far on their side. All he wanted was for all his friends that were still alive to fight eagerly against their opponents and never give up.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
