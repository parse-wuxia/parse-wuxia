For her to lose everything she had worked so hard to achieve just to be resurrected early would be a fate worse than death. I, as well, will also wait for when we get our hands on the method to refine suitable bodies for us. Even if it takes thousands of years, then so be it, we will wait!&apos;</p><p>Hui Yue listened to Lan Feng intently, but the thought of being able to see and talk to Wang Ju Long tugged at his heartstrings. It was now possible to awaken her! But if he did, it was likely that she would end up hating him for destroying all the hard work she had spent cultivating.</p><p>&apos;Ju Long is in no pain,&apos; Lan Feng sighed once again. &apos;She is unable to awaken but she is now a complete soul, to her, it will not matter if she waits one year or thousands of years, she will not notice the flow of time. It is you who has to be determined enough to be able to go on without her.&apos;</p><p>Hui Yue sighed. He truly wished to resurrect her right now and take her in his arms, but he understood that Lan Feng was correct. He thought back to when they had met at the academy. Back then she had done everything in her power to become a cultivator that others would look up to. Her mindset was such that when he came along and challenged her, she was so stubborn about defeating him that she ignored everything else and sought to overcome only him .</p><p>He understood that if he took her cultivation base away from her, he might as well ask her to die for him, something she had already done once, and this was absolutely something that would not happen again. Thus he decided that he could let her rest. He would wait to hold her till the day where he could form a suitable body for her, a body which would allow her to be completely restored.</p><p>Having made his decision, Hui Yue looked at Yanluo with a decisive gleam in his eyes. &quot;I will wait,&quot; he said. The sadness in his voice was something that anyone could pick up on much less the King of Hell, but neither mentioned it. It was ignored as if it had never happened.</p><p>&quot;I need your help though,&quot; Hui Yue continued. &quot;I have another companion. She has been confined to the Divine Beast World for the last few years because we fear that her father would show up and try to kidnap her, were she not with us. But now we are no longer within the Celestial Sword Sect, and all of us are traveling together, I think it is time for her to be with us again. Could I trouble you to find another room for her?&quot;</p><p>Yanluo asked no questions and just nodded his head. &quot;That is a small task,&quot; he said with a smile. Hui Yue had already done so much for Diyu that Yanluo was willing to go to war for him, if the need should arise, let alone find a room for another guest.</p><p>&quot;I will summon her when we are done,&quot; Hui Yue said, and Yanluo nodded his head. Both became silent as they looked at the soul in front of them which was greedily absorbing the Nirvana Phoenix Flame.</p><p>Although it was but a single wisp, this flame would be powerful enough to last for a full month before the last bit was consumed.</p><p>&quot;There is no more reason for us to stay here,&quot; Yanluo said with a sigh as he turned to leave with Hui Yue following behind. He knew that this would not be the last time he got to see King Chujiang as his soul would need at least three more treatments with the Nirvana Phoenix Flame.</p><p>They went all the way back to the main hall where they had talked together earlier that day, and Hui Yue understood that now he could fetch Rong Xing.</p><p>He entered the Universe Box and then entered the Divine Beast World. There he headed to the capital of Taiyang Kingdom where he knew Ma Kong, Gao Yan, and Rong Xing were currently living.</p><p>All three of his friends had become Gods, but only Rong Xing was actively cultivating and comprehending the dao. Ma Kong and Gao Yan would not be leaving the Divine Beast World. They had to take care of their families and for this reason they had chosen to stay behind. Although they would not be able to help Hui Yue in the outside world, the two of them did everything in their power to assist him with matters inside the Divine Beast World.</p><p>The two of them ensured that there was no internal strife. They ensured that the balance between humans and beasts was not broken and that no one did anything stupid. Under their guidance, the world was flourishing and producing great amounts of life force which was being shared with Hui Yue.</p><p>Rong Xing, on the other hand, was a completely different story. She was going to follow Hui Yue as she had sworn to get her brother back. To restore her brother&apos;s freedom she would do anything, but she also understood that this path would put her in danger.</p><p>If her father heard that she was within a guardian sect of the Celestial Sword Sect, who knew what he would do to get her out and then take her with him.</p><p>To avoid this, Rong Xing had been training within the Divine Beast World. Every month Hui Yue would arrive with plenty of resources for her to use.</p><p>The cultivation resources were rich and Rong Xing had another benefit that many of the other Gods did not have and that was the Formation of Life.</p><p>The Formation of Life had finally been reunited with the Divine Beast World, and it was constantly releasing Ancestral Worldpower into the world. All this Ancestral Worldpower was incredibly pure, and Rong Xing greedily absorbed as much as she could. She had received so much energy from cultivating near the Formation of Life that she was no longer a new God but had been promoted to a proper Primordial Immortal!</p><p>She had also been using Pills of Clarity, and she had managed to comprehend seven daos, all of which were under the major dao of darkness.</p><p>When Hui Yue arrived in Taiyang&apos;s capital, he headed straight for his mansion which still belonged to him. Since she had gone into hiding, Rong Xing had stayed there so that he would be able to find her at a moment&apos;s notice.</p><p>As he entered the mansion he could feel how the energy in the surroundings was being drawn towards the gardens, and as he entered the gardens, he came face to face with Rong Xing who was training.</p><p>Clearing his throat he awoke the woman from her meditation and as she awoke she looked rather confused at Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;Sorry it took this long,&quot; he apologized. Previously he had already told Rong Xing that it would take some time before he would be able to visit again due to their long journey, but now that he was finally here, Rong Xing just smiled warmly at him.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x2019;s leave the Divine Beast World,&quot; Hui Yue continued. &quot;We&#x2019;ll travel the galaxy and look for the Alchemist God. When we have obtained the method to refine bodies then we will go after An He and your father. I am certain we will be able to find Ming then as well.&quot;</p><p>Rong Xing nodded her head. &quot;I&#x2019;ve heard some new things about An He. Let&#x2019;s head out and I will tell you about it afterwards. King Yanluo is waiting for us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me pack a few things,&quot; Rong Xing said as jumped to her feet and rushed into the mansion. In a few minutes she returned with a few storage stones embedded in rings on her fingers.</p><p>&quot;You packed alreadylong ago?&quot; Hui Yue had already guessed the answer, but he still asked the question, and Rong Xing nodded her head, &quot;I couldn&#x2019;t wait. Although I know the risk, I want to leave this world behind and enter the vast galaxy. I want to see the world my brother now resides in.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue understood Rong Xing&apos;s longing to be with her brother again. It had been more than fifty years since she had last seen him and previously they had been inseparable. Although Hui Yue considered Rong Xing and Rong Ming his brothers and sisters, he knew that the twins had an even closer bond than what he could understand.</p><p>&quot;Well then, since you already packed, let&#x2019;s go,&quot; Hui Yue said as he held out his hand. Rong Xing took it without a moment of hesitation and suddenly the world distorted around them. Rong Xing and Hui Yue traveled through the space of the Universe Box before they appeared within Yanluo&apos;s mansion in Youdu.</p><p>The moment they appeared in the hall, Yanluo looked curiously at Rong Xing before nodding his head approvingly. &quot;She has a good foundation,&quot; he praised, and Rong Xing, who had always been very polite, instantly bowed to Yanluo with soundless thanks.</p><p>&quot;Well a maid will come and pick you up soon,&quot; Yanluo said with a shrug of his shoulders. &quot;As long as you are within my mansion, no one will be able to kidnap you, but I suggest you keep as low a profile as possible. Although you are safe now that does not mean you will be safe when you are travelling throughout the galaxy.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue heard what Yanluo said and carved the words into his heart. It was clear that many dangers awaited them, but he was not going to back away just because of the many dangers that they might face.</p><p>A knocking sound could be heard and afterwards a maid appeared in the doorway. &quot;My lord, my lady, please follow me,&quot; she said respectfully, and Hui Yue waved goodbye to Yanluo before he and Rong Xing followed the maid towards Rong Xing&#x2019;s new room.</p><p>The room was neat, it was very similar to the one that Hui Yue had been given and it was not far away from his room either. &quot;Let&#x2019;s gather everyone,&quot; Hui Yue said as he took out his communication orb and contacted everyone. It did not take long before the small room was completely packed.</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s eyes blazed with the will to do battle as he remembered what Yanluo had told him today, and he truly wished to fight An He as soon as possible, but he knew that he had certain responsibilities which he needed to take care of first.</p><p>&quot;I spoke with Yanluo just now,&quot; Hui Yue started and slowly explained everything that Yanluo had told him about An He.</p><p>Everyone listened intently, and no one interrupted with questions, but all of them had unsightly expressions on their faces. They all had a hard time believing that An He had gotten so strong, especially the beast Gods, but they also understood that Hui Yue and Yanluo would not lie about something so important.</p><p>&quot;If he is that strong, we just need to be that much stronger!&quot; Xiao Ning said as a matter of fact, and everyone else nodded their heads. &quot;I suddenly feel like I will have a breakthrough in my cultivation soon,&quot; Yan Lei said with a serious expression on his face as he left the room.</p><p>The others did not speak much, but they too were determined as they left one after another. All of them were more determined than ever to become stronger. They had already been very pleased with their performance, but after hearing how strong An He had become, it was as if someone had dumped a bucket of cold water on their head. They now acutely understood that they had a long way to go.</p><p>Eventually, only Hui Yue, Rong Xing, and Deng Wu were left in the room and seeing the eyes that the two others sent each other, Hui Yue smirked as he quickly took his leave.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
