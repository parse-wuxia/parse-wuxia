It was a process that would take almost a year as his soul could only be strengthened with the Nirvana Phoenix Flame once a month, and his soul was severely injured.</p><p>During this year, Hui Yue would spend two-thirds of the day together with the Alchemist God, hearing about the theory behind alchemy.</p><p>Although the Alchemist God was incapable of concocting pills himself, he was still able to guide Hui Yue through the process.</p><p>Together Hui Yue and the Alchemist God made countless pills. They made so many pills that they just started to give them to the others. Some were useful in fights while others were used for cultivating.</p><p>The ones which were used for cultivating were both Pills of Clarity which focused on the dao and pills which made the body able to refine Ancestral Worldpower faster.</p><p>The other pills, the pills which were used in fighting, ranged from healing pills to pills which boosted one&#x2019;s strength temporarily or even allowed one to control an extra dao.</p><p>Plants were being picked up all over the world, but even so one wouldn&#x2019;t be able to tell that they had harvested quite a number of herbs.</p><p>While Hui Yue spent the majority of his time together with the Alchemist God, he did not forget his friends. The last one-third of the day was spent accompanying his two girls.</p><p>They would cultivate together, walk through the ruins of the sect together, and just enjoy their lives.</p><p>While Hui Yue was busy learning alchemy, the two girls would stay in their courtyard and cultivate. Although Huli had been a strong expert for a long time, she was now weaker than Hui Yue, and as a result, she trained even harder than she had before.</p><p>Sha Yun was aware of her own strength, and due to it she too cultivated as much as she could.</p><p>The benefits of cultivating within the Archaic World was that while one was cultivating the dao, the dense Ancestral Worldpower in the surroundings would ensure that the body was automatically refining it at the same time.</p><p>Just being in the middle area of the Ancient World was even more efficient than trying to refine Ancestral Worldpower in the Celestial Sword Sect which occupied one of the heavenly worlds.</p><p>From this, one could see just how much Ancestral Worldpower was around them.</p><p>This truly was a paradise for anyone who wished to cultivate, but the benefits came with certain risks. Many dangers came with being in the middle area of the Archaic World.</p><p>Many of the friends who had come with Hui Yue were no longer within the old sect, all of them were out exploring the world, looking for treasures or rare herbs.</p><p>Days went by in peace. Sometimes the beast Gods or his friends would come by and see how Hui Yue was doing; they would talk about what they had experienced in this world that was filled with herbs as far as they had searched.</p><p>Xiao Hui had originally planned on staying with Hui Yue and the Alchemist God, but he had forged a great relationship with Lei, Lao, and Jo, and when they decided to start exploring the world, Xiao Hui followed them.</p><p>For him, this world was something he had never explored before. He was one of the pills from the pill pavilion which had managed to absorb the Ancestral Worldpower and eventually gain enough energy to create his own body.</p><p>Since then he had waited in the sect&apos;s grounds for someone to come, maybe another pill which gained a human body and sentience, or visitors from the outside world.</p><p>One of the visitors who appeared was the Alchemist God, and the two had engaged in daily sparring about alchemy which had improved both&apos;s understanding of pill making.</p><p>All that the Alchemist God had learned was now being given to Hui Yue who was like a sponge, greedily absorbing everything that he was taught.</p><p>As time went by, the Alchemist God felt more and more excited. The choice of taking Hui Yue as his student was simply the best choice he had made.</p><p>He had long since heard from Hui Yue that he had been resurrected by a phoenix, and as a result, his soul was many times stronger than the average soul due to his merged memories of his past lives.</p><p>This also made him even more skilled when it came to alchemy. He was a talented individual who was able to understand things almost instantly as he was taught them, and it only took a few attempts for him to fully understand what the Alchemist God was teaching him.</p><p>&quot;Although you learn fast, you still have a long way to go before you are able to refine a body,&quot; the Alchemist God said with a sigh. &quot;When my soul is fully nurtured, then I will be able to teach you how to create a body, and I will help you refine quite a few since I assume you will need a lot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I noticed you took quite a few materials from the sect, and amongst those were some metals and alloys.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Although alchemy primarily depends on herbs, we will need other materials to create bodies. I assume that there are enough metals in your possession to create them, if not we will have to go mining.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mining?&quot; Hui Yue was confused, but the Alchemist God just laughed, &quot;Yes, mining.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This world is marvelous. Although everything is covered by herbs now, there were also other things such as mountains of precious metals here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These mountains are now covered by herbs, but if we need them, we can dig through the thin ground and find the precious metals.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This world&apos;s history is very limited. This world was actually a world where only plants were able to live.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Some people from the outside, back when the Archaic World was whole, arrived at this world and built a sect.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The entire sect, which was the only place for living beings within this world, was famous throughout the Archaic World, but every resource that the sect had came from this world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everyone from all over wished to join to get the benefits of being apart of this sect, but eventually the Archaic World was created, and slowly humans became extinct in this region.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It took a long time for Xiao Hui to become a real living creature. When he had succeeded, the humans had already gone extinct. At the start, he lived within the pill pavilion unaware of the fact that there was light beyond the door.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I stumbled upon him by accident, and since then he and I have been exchanging knowledge. He would expound on his knowledge of alchemy and teach me alchemy&apos;s secrets, things that only a pill would know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In return, I taught him about real life. About what it means to be a living person and about what it means to be able to read, fight, and comprehend the dao.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since then, others have visited us.&quot; The Alchemist God was talking a bit about their current situation. &quot;We welcome all visitors with open arms, but we have not told them about Xiao Hui&apos;s real body.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are many greedy people in the world. If they knew about his identity other than a great alchemist, no one knows what might happen. He has made many pills for himself allowing himself to comprehend two major daos; therefore, he is quite strong.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No one wishes to cause trouble to gain nothing, so everyone who visited us has left after a period of time, but I guess that this is also how rumors about our world traveled to the outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Little Yue, tell me about the world outside. How does it look now?&quot;</p><p>The Alchemist God had left the outside world behind many years prior, but he was still eager to hear what had been going on since his departure. Hui Yue told him many stories about how the current galaxy&#x2019;s powers were situated, but even so, the Alchemist God was still eager to know more.</p><p>Hui Yue told the Alchemist God everything he knew, and time and time again he told the story of his ascension as a Judge of Hell.</p><p>When Hui Yue was busy accompanying Sha Yun and Huli, the Alchemist God would always be with Little Green. Since Hui Yue and Little Green had arrived, the Alchemist God had been smiling all the time; he was truly happy.</p><p>Day after day went by as they concocted pill after pill and discussed the teachings of alchemy. As time went by, they had all fallen into a specific pattern of life.</p><p>Hui Yue would concoct pills and spend time with the girls. The girls would look after the many houses and gardens in the residential area and whenever they had spare time they kept Hui Yue company.</p><p>His friends were all busy exploring the world, and they were often gone for months at a time.</p><p>Soon a year had passed, and laughter erupted from the courtyard as the Alchemist God was filled with excitement. His soul had finally fully healed, and he was ecstatic.</p><p>&quot;Little Yue, I am healed!&quot; The Alchemist God said as he rushed from his courtyard towards the courtyard that was next to his own. His face shone with a brilliant smile, and his eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><p>Hui Yue had been accompanying Huli and Sha Yun, but when he heard the laughter and saw the middle-aged man rush out from the other courtyard, he too smiled and left the two beauties by his side.</p><p>&apos;The old man finally succeeded in healing his soul!&apos; Lan Feng said. Although his words were rather harsh, there was anticipation in his voice. Having the Alchemist God fully healed meant that they would be able to start making bodies soon. Refining bodies meant that Lan Feng would soon be able to leave the inside of Hui Yue&apos;s core.</p><p>Hui Yue could feel that Lan Feng&apos;s voice was shaking slightly. It was clear that he was feeling excited beyond belief, and who could blame him.</p><p>He had been without a body for so long. He had been trapped within a phoenix hairpiece for so long, and when he finally managed to get out, he was then trapped within Hui Yue&apos;s core for a very long time.</p><p>&quot;You have done your teacher a great favor,&quot; the Alchemist God said with a great smile on his face. &quot;To heal my soul is something I had completely given up on.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now that I am healed, I am sure that I will be able to refine a body, and thus I will teach you how to. I know how eager you are to refine bodies as soon as possible.&quot;</p><p>The Alchemist God was aware of the situation with both Wang Ju Long and Lan Feng. Although Hui Yue wished to make bodies for all his friends, the most important people to make a body for were Wang Ju Long, so that she could once more become a real, living person, and his best brother Lan Feng. Lan Feng also needed a real body, and to do so, Hui Yue needed to learn how to refine bodies.</p><p>&quot;Well, let this old man head towards the herb fields. We will need the next many weeks to harvest herbs required to refine bodies.&quot; the Alchemist God said honestly.</p><p>&quot;We will have to travel the entire world to be able to find all the herbs we need and then we need to find the precious metals that will help in the refining process.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Refining a body is different from concocting a pill. Refining a body means that we are refining something without a pill furnace; It is a very hard thing to accomplish, but I believe in you. Now let&#x2019;s set out!&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
