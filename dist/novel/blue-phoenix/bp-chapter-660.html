He understood that it would be impossible for him to gain any more comprehension over the dao on this short trip, and instead, he spent the time sparring with Wei, Cai Jie, Huli, and Pei Ziqi.</p><p>Although he was now the strongest, he had not fully gotten used to all the strength at his disposal, and thus, he needed practice to familiarize himself with the three daos he knew.</p><p>The dao was connected to the soul, so it was his soul which had comprehended the dao. Thus it had become a natural part of the expert&apos;s soul.</p><p>Since Lan Feng and Hui Yue&apos;s souls had merged a bit with one another, the daos that they controlled had completely merged with both souls as well. It was not like with Ancestral Worldpower where Hui Yue needed to ask permission to use the dao of fire. Now, the dao of fire had already become a part of him just as the dao of earth and the dao of wind had become apart of Lan Feng.</p><p>During their trip, the beast Gods, and his friends and family were all deeply focused on cultivating. They did not even leave their rooms whenever a bandit attack appeared. They had left defending the shuttle to Hui Yue and the other stronger experts who had already comprehended a major dao.</p><p>During their trip, the beast Gods, and his friends and family were all deeply focused on cultivating. They did not even leave their rooms whenever a bandit attack appeared. They had left defending the shuttle to Hui Yue and the other stronger experts who had already comprehended a major dao.</p><p>After seeing Hui Yue&apos;s prowess, they failed to believe that any bandits would pose a real threat to them.</p><p>They also had the Divine Halo Formation, but Hui Yue had not activated it.</p><p>&quot;I need the bandits to test out my strength and get used to it,&quot; he argued. &quot;If they saw a Divine Halo Formation, then they are likely to not attack us.&quot;</p><p>Previously in the first bandit attack, they had just forgotten to activate the formation, and now they did not use it on purpose.</p><p>Every time the bandits appeared, Hui Yue would kill them and steal all their treasures. &apos;We are getting rich!&apos; Lan Feng exclaimed excitedly after the third bandit group had been wiped out, but Hui Yue just chuckled.</p><p>He had not been able to get any information about the Archaic World from the Universe Box, but he had managed to obtain even more Worldpower Stones and materials that would prove useful on their journey. For this reason, he was already as rich as a middle-ranked sect all by himself.</p><p>But despite being so wealthy, he would not let any of his treasures go to waste. He would gladly accept the wealth that was kindly delivered to his doorstep.</p><p>&apos;Oh, there are a few formations in this ring,&apos; Lan Feng said, and Hui Yue, who was suddenly curious, opened the ring. Just as Lan Feng had said, there were a set of formations.</p><p>These formations were nothing exceptional, but they were not bad either, and Hui Yue instantly memorized them before he placed them in the Universe Box. &quot;Let&#x2019;s donate them to the Celestial Sword Sect when we get home,&quot; he said with a brilliant smile.</p><p>Most of the items he had found could be used by himself or his friends. There were many materials that he could use to concoct pills or give to Deng Wu who could use inscriptions. But what there was most of was Worldpower Stones.</p><p>By only killing three bandit groups they had already earned around five hundred thousand Worldpower Stones, a massive amount of wealth. Were it not for the Universe Box then this would have been so much wealth that Hui Yue would be grinning in a silly way.</p><p>But Hui Yue did have the wealth from the Universe Box, and because of this, he saw no reason not to take the Worldpower Stones and split them evenly between his friends instead.</p><p>Pei Ziqi, who had been an elder in the Celestial Sword Sect and was now a Dao Protector was considered a wealthy individual, but her personal wealth was only around a hundred thousand Worldpower Stones.</p><p>Seeing how they gained so much wealth in such a short time, her eyes turn slightly red. She secretly hoped that even more bandits would be stupid enough to throw their lives away and come challenge them.</p><p>The further they went on their travels, the more they sensed how the Ancestral Worldpower in the surroundings was thickening.</p><p>&quot;If the energy is already this rich when we are still a few months away from the Archaic World, imagine how amazing it will be to cultivate in the Archaic World,&quot; Cai Jie said smilingly.</p><p>Although he had comprehended an entire major dao, he was still fighting hard to comprehend his second one. At the same time, he also understood that there was no limit to how much Ancestral Worldpower one could have. It was simple, the more, the better, and thus, they all sat down on the ground and absorbed the Ancestral Worldpower as soon as they could.</p><p>There were two ways of cultivating. One was to cultivate one&#x2019;s Ancestral Worldpower; the other was to cultivate the dao.</p><p>When one cultivated the dao, one could only focus on the dao, and everything around them would become unimportant. It was possible to be awakened from this cultivation because of outside interference, but if that happened then everything that one had comprehended would be lost.</p><p>The cultivation of Ancestral Worldpower was many times easier. One would sit still and draw the Ancestral Worldpower from the world into their bodies after which one would let it flow through the core and claim it as their own.</p><p>This kind of cultivation did not require much focus. While cultivating like this, it was possible to still be on high alert and keep an eye on one&#x2019;s surroundings. At the same time, if one were to be interrupted nothing would happen. The Ancestral Worldpower which had already been claimed would stay in the body and at most the energy which had not been brought through the core would dissipate.</p><p>Cai Jie, Wei, Hui Yue, Huli, and Pei Ziqi were all seated on the deck of the ship-like shuttle and were greedily absorbing Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p>Hui Yue had used the blue cloud to surround all of them, and with the help from the blue cloud, everyone had at least twice as fast an absorption rate as they would have had otherwise.</p><p>Hui Yue, who was the owner of the blue cloud, also benefitted even more from being surrounded by it. He was able to absorb energy at three times the normal rate.</p><p>Ancestral Worldpower kept appearing in his body, flowing through it like a river that had broken through a dam and pouring into the Ancestral Worldpower pool.</p><p>Hui Yue smiled as he could feel how he was growing stronger. He was not as strong as Yanluo, but currently, he was at least as strong as King Chujiang had been in his prime.</p><p>They continued onward in silence. No one spoke, and everyone was fully focused on their cultivation.</p><p>The further they traveled through the void, the more people they saw on their journey and the more often they were attacked by bandits.</p><p>In this world, everyone was a bandit. Everyone was tempted by the wealth of others, and only those who already had immense wealth or those who focused solely on cultivating stayed away from attacking other experts.</p><p>Fortunately, not many common rogue cultivators attacked Hui Yue&apos;s shuttle. Most of these cultivators were in small groups of five, and usually, they were in this area to explore the Archaic World for treasures. They had long since understood that whoever was on board this massive shuttle would be way more than five experts and they had to have an outstanding background.</p><p>The last month before reaching the Archaic World they came across more and more smaller realms which had been created by the groups who entered the Archaic World frequently.</p><p>Many of these realms were smaller than even an immortal cities, and they were closed by formations ensuring that only certain invited individuals could go inside them.</p><p>But when they were ten days away from the Archaic World, they came across a major realm. It was the same size as Youdu, and it was bursting with energy. Shuttles were constantly entering and leaving this massive realm.</p><p>&quot;I wonder what this is,&quot; Hui Yue said with a frown. He had only gathered information about the Archaic World and not the surrounding areas, and by now he understood that this was a mistake.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Wei answered with a shrug of his shoulders, but Pei Ziqi frowned and answered.</p><p>&quot;We have people entering the Archaic World for training from time to time,&quot; she admitted, and when she did it was clear that she had some information about this place.</p><p>&quot;This has to be the Blissful Realm. It is controlled by a very strong Crowned Sovereign. Although this is not the world that the Crowned Sovereign has become the sovereign of, she still resides in this realm, and has left the world she controls to others to look after.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a massive hub. It is a place where people can sell their items which they acquired in the Archaic World or buy anything that their heart might desire.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is always a good idea to enter this realm from time to time and hear the newest gossip about the Archaic World. There are always rumors about new realms which appear from deep within the area, or about worlds that have collapsed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since this is the case, we should enter and see what kind of rumors we can hear about. Perhaps there are some rumors about the Alchemist God or the worlds and realms he has been looking for,&quot; Hui Yue said decisively, and the shuttle changed direction and started moving towards the Blissful Realm instead of the Archaic World.</p><p>&quot;Halt!&quot; A voice called out.</p><p>Outside the realm, there were a large group of guards. They were all wearing the same red uniforms and had high-grade treasures in their hands.</p><p>&quot;Hand over ten Worldpower Stones for each person on the shuttle and another thousand Worldpower Stones for the shuttle itself before you are allowed to enter the realm.&quot; A guard said with a smirk on his face.</p><p>It was true that there was a fee of ten Worldpower Stones a person for those who wished to enter the realm, but the thousand Worldpower Stones for the shuttle was something the guard came up with on his own when he saw how grand the shuttle was. It was clear that he wished to earn some extra money for himself and his brothers.</p><p>Hui Yue looked at the people and narrowed his eyes. He had no problem paying for all his friends, but he would not accept someone bullying him, and thus he waved his hand.</p><p>&quot;Sorry guys it&#x2019;s time to wake up,&quot; he said with a sigh, and everyone on board the ship woke from their cultivation. Two moments after, the shuttle had vanished into the Universe Box.</p><p>&quot;We have no shuttle, only us,&quot; Hui Yue said casually, and the guard&apos;s face turned rather ugly.</p><p>By now quite a few had gathered around them. There was always a constant flow of people entering the realm, and quite a few had heard the overbearing request of the guard. When they heard this request, they wanted to see how Hui Yue handled it.</p><p>At first, the guard had thought that there were only five experts, but when he saw all the others arriving from within the shuttle, his heart started beating a little faster.</p><p>There was simply so many experts of the Immortal of Creation rank in this group! It was an elite group amongst elite groups, but the shuttle did not have any seals on it showing which faction they belonged to.</p><p>Because of this, the guard had felt rather safe, and he pushed out his chest.</p><p>&quot;You had your shuttle just moments before. Don&apos;t try to cheat us!&quot; he said enraged, but Hui Yue just glanced at him. &quot;Can you see a shuttle now?&quot; he asked, and the guard felt rather uncomfortable. Shaking his head, he looked at Hui Yue with flaring eyes.</p><p>When riding a tiger&apos;s back it was hard to get off, and now, there was no way he would back down and lose face!</p><p></p></div><p></p>
