The dao surrounding him grew thicker, the strength of his attacks increased.</p><p>Hui Yue knew that he was in a rush if he wanted to behead this demon, and he also understood that he had to be fast so that he could hide the Celestial Sword once more. He dared not use it more than necessary.</p><p>Hui Yue charged forward and the sword chopped down. The demon just snorted disdainfully at Hui Yue. He had not noticed the sword had changed, and instead, was sure that it was the same weak attacks as before. Even though it would cause a bloody wound to appear on his body, it was not at the level that could threaten his life.</p><p>Hui Yue had expected as much and as the sword came bearing down upon the demon a sinister smile appeared on his lips. The sword dug into the demon&apos;s neck and cut through it like a hot knife through butter.</p><p>The demon&apos;s face contorted into a grimace of shock, but then his soul fled his body, only to be gobbled up by the Celestial Sword.</p><p>The moment that the soul entered the sword, Hui Yue felt a heat run through the sword before it returned to its usual temperature and laid motionless in his hands.</p><p>Hui Yue could not sense any changes within the sword after having absorbed the soul, but he was not going to experiment on it now. So instead he hurried to hide the sword within his Universe Box once more and took out his Sword of the Icy Tempest.</p><p>No one noticed the sudden change of swords, and the only thing that people sensed was that the dao in the surroundings had thickened and gotten stronger, but after the sword vanished everything returned to normal.</p><p>Hui Yue grinned maliciously as he was satisfied with the Celestial Sword.</p><p>Having killed two of the supreme experts on the demon&#x2019;s side, Hui Yue took a moment to get a good view of the army beneath him.</p><p>His eyes first landed on Ye Ling, Zhu Jun, Luo Qiang, and Xiao Ning. The four of them had learned how to fight well side by side, and their daos were complimenting one another; they knew each other very well.</p><p>Xiao Ning was standing at the front, taking the brunt of all attacks, laughing at the faces of the demons as he used his inhuman strength and his overwhelmingly strong defense to just block all of their attacks. A shield was hanging on one arm, and a short sword was in his other.</p><p>Ye Ling, Zhu Jun, and Luo Qiang were laughing behind his back as they threw attack after attack at the demons in front of Xiao Ning, killing them in waves.</p><p>They had nothing to fear as they were protected by Xiao Ning, although someone tried to go around him, it was impossible to really get an attack past Xiao Ning&apos;s defenses, and he had a speed that did not match his bulky exterior. He moved with such speed that he could hold down at least ten demon Gods at the same time.</p><p>Seeing these four work together in such a manner made Hui Yue laugh. They were rather cheeky, but in war, every trick was accepted.</p><p>His eyes drifted to Pei Ziqi who was still killing in a frenzy. She was deep into enemy lines and had a trail of blood behind her.</p><p>Shaking his head because he was shocked at how she could continue to have energy after so much killing, he could only hope that she would not suddenly get low on energy and be surrounded, losing her life in the process.</p><p>Wan Qiao was together with Sha Yun, Wang Ju Long, Huli, and Xiao She. Those five women were also giving it their all, but Wang Ju Long was, although fighting seriously, clearly being enlightened. She could feel the dao of darkness all around her, and she was using this chance to comprehend the major dao of darkness.</p><p>Hui Yue squinted his eyes as he watched Wang Ju Long. Not only was she comprehending the major dao of darkness, but it was also clear that she was sensing the dao of death.</p><p>This heavenly dao was constantly present on the battlefield, and it was very familiar to Wang Ju Long. She had sensed it for many years and been a part of it. Now that it surrounded her like this, it was filling her body and becoming a part of her once more. It was allowing for her to control and comprehend the entire heavenly dao of death.</p><p>Hui Yue felt elated. If Wang Ju Long could be able to comprehend the dao of death, then they would be able to fight much more fiercely against the demons.</p><p>His eyes continued to roam across the battlefield. Hu Yong, Shen Wei, and Tang Tian were fighting together as well. They had taken on their original beastly bodies of a rhinoceros, jackal, and flood dragon, and they crushed demons beneath them with their power alone.</p><p>Their new bodies were the strongest bodies in the galaxy coupled with their beastly size and inborn strength made them able to kill up to ten demons at a time.</p><p>Lu Jing, Jia Na, Yan Lei, Zhong Li, and Mu Haolong were also using their original bodies. However, they were fighting one on one, not relying on anyone else to assist them.</p><p>Especially Zhong Li, the Qilin, he was causing massive damage to the demons by constantly using the power of electricity.</p><p>Jo, Lao, and Lei were fighting together, but they were the ones who were taking it the easiest.</p><p>They were not as deep into the enemy&apos;s territory as the others, but they still fought with all their strength and caused demons to die left and right.</p><p>Cai Jie and Wei were both fighting supreme experts, but when he looked at them, he noticed that they were fighting effortlessly. The demons they were up against were not as strong as the demon whom Old Man Ling was fighting, and if anything, they were a little stronger than Hui Yue&apos;s first enemy.</p><p>Knowing that they were safe, or at least had their situations under control, Hui Yue did not pursue the other supreme experts. Instead, he dove head first into the fray and started to slaughter everyone in sight.</p><p>Unlike Pei Ziqi, Hui Yue did not go deep into enemy lines. Instead, he focused on helping out when he saw experts pressured by the demons or slaughtering demons the places where they held the upper hand in the battles.</p><p>Due to this, the demons were slowly losing ground. Originally the demons assumed that they would simply overwhelm their enemy because they had more supreme experts, but now it was going the other way.</p><p>The supreme experts that they valued highly had been easily slain, and the common demons were being slaughtered.</p><p>This was the second time they had tried to take over this city, and the second time they had met resistance beyond their expectations.</p><p>Suffering continuous defeat was not beneficial for their campaign, and the demons seemed to understand that things were not going as planned.</p><p>Some tried to turn around and flee while others fought with undying fierceness.</p><p>Unfortunately, for the fleeing demons, there was nowhere for them to run. In front of them were savage experts with a vengeance against them and behind them was a sea of demons that constantly tried to participate in the battle and kill as many humans as possible.</p><p>It was impossible for the demons to break into a uniform retreat as there was no leader in their midsts. The supreme experts that the weaker demons listened to were all preoccupied. They were locked in fights with the enemy&#x2019;s supreme experts, and whenever they tried to back away, the opponent would charge recklessly at them with their weapons raised high and their daos twisting around them.</p><p>The supreme demons had a hard enough time fighting to keep their own lives, thus they did not have the time to survey the overall situation of the fight.</p><p>On the ground in the melee where everyone seemed to turn into bloodthirsty maniacs, Hui Yue and his friends were scouring the battlefield.</p><p>Although the city was losing many human and beast cultivators, it was nothing compared to the losses of the demons.</p><p>The demons lost ten to twenty experts for each human or beast cultivator that died. They had lost their momentum, and they fell into a disorderly group that did not know what to do. Their defeat was imminent, it was just a question of how many demons they could slay before they were able to retreat.</p><p>Pei Ziqi had managed to get through the entire army of demons and emerge on the other side. Her face showed clear confusion when she arrived on the other side and there were no more demons to slaughter, but when she noticed the fleeing demon experts a snicker appeared on her lips and she began to butcher anyone who tried to retreat rather than advance.</p><p>Although she was at the back and was killing the deserters, she knew that if the entire army chose to retreat, then no matter how much strength she still had left, it would be impossible for her to stop them all. Since this was the case, she would just kill as many as possible and ensure that the demons suffered a heavy blow.</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light appeared by her side. When she turned to look, she saw Hui Yue and Cai Jie appear near her.</p><p>The two of them had finished what they were doing. Cai Jie had stopped playing with the supreme Immortal of Creation and killed him, and Hui Yue stopped rushing around saving beasts and human cultivators.</p><p>Both of them had noticed that Pei Ziqi was about to barricaded the back of the army by herself, and had ensured that so far, none had managed to escape the warzone.</p><p>But they knew as more and more demons turned tail and fled, she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to keep it up.</p><p>Hui Yue and Cai Jie had not spoken, they just decided at the same time to assist her. The three of them were incredibly fast. They rushed from one end of the army to the other, and heads were constantly rolling everywhere they passed. Their actions caused fear to erupt in the hearts of the demon cultivators.</p><p>At the front was a whole army of demons and beasts, and they were overwhelming in both numbers and strength.</p><p>Behind them were three supreme experts that slaughtered them like chickens.</p><p>No matter which way they turned, certain death waited for them and not all of them dared to flee just yet. No one had ordered a retreat, but what these normal soldier demons were unaware of was that there was no longer anyone alive who could order a retreat. All their supreme experts had perished.</p><p>The entire army&apos;s morale deflated. More and more demons started to lose hope as they saw their fellow brethren trampled over by the human experts.</p><p>While the demons became panicked and filled with fear, the humans and beasts were filled with courage, killing intent, and hope for their city.</p><p>The more they advanced, the stronger they felt, and the easier it was to slay the demons. All the supreme experts had gone to the back of the army and split it into sections, ensuring that not even one demon escape. The main army attacked from the front, and the entire demon army was crushed underneath the combined power of the human and beasts.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
