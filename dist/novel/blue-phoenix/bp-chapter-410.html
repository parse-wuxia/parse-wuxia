She could tell that Hui Yue had never before made a medicinal pill, however, here he was, an hour and a half into the examination, and the pill he had created had such a strong aroma that it had to be perfect. The medicinal scent and the clarity of the color were what one would use to determine just how much of the medicinal herbs had survived the refinement process. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The aroma that came from Hui Yue&apos;s pill caused some of the apprentices close by Hui Yue to become greatly shocked causing them to lose focus and fail at their refinement process. These new alchemists knew that they did not have the time to redo the pill and a sour look appeared on their faces. They were likely to have succeeded had it not been for that ridiculously strong aroma they smelled. </span></p><br><p><span style="">By Hui Yue&apos;s side, Zhong Hei was able to concentrate fully on his herbs and their refinement. He too had reached a crucial point concocting his pill; the stage where one had to add in the small pearl. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue observed the rest of the alchemists to see how they were faring. &#xA0;Some had given up, while others were fully concentrating on their cauldrons still trying to create the pill in question. Only one other apprentice alchemist had finished his pill, and the aroma that arrived from his jade vial was not any less than the one coming from Hui Yue&apos;s. The white-haired young man was shocked to see that he was not the only one who had created a perfect pill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I knew he would refine a perfect one,&quot; The woman mumbled to herself as she nodded her head. He was a known figure within the alchemy world of the Taiyang kingdom. His teacher was the absolute strongest alchemist in the entire country, and he had taught his student well. He would not allow him to take the exam before he had over a ninety percent success rate on the Lion Strength pill. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was unaware of any of this, and thus deep within his heart, he felt reverence towards this other expert. He did not have the cauldron that assisted Hui Yue, nor did he have a cultivation base as strong as Hui Yue which helped him better control his flame. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Having considered these two things, Hui Yue understood just how hard it was to get a perfect pill, and he acknowledged that the other man was in a realm far above him in alchemy.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While Hui Yue was deep in thought, another strong aroma originated from the seat next to Hui Yue and he was shocked once more as he looked to the side. He saw that Zhong Hei had managed to create a perfect pill just as well as he had. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Having created this pill, Hui Yue could feel the energy inside his body surge once more, and he smiled contended. He was more than satisfied with the increase in power he had gotten while concocting this pill. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The exam is over!&quot; The woman called out and once more everyone present stood up. They formed a line and looked at each other. Of the group, only three had managed to create a pill, and the three who had succeeded had all created perfect pills. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The woman was shocked. As the exam begun she had expected one person to succeed, the young man with the best alchemist as his teacher. Hui Yue and Zhong Hei were two dark horses, and she had not expected would be able to create such stunning results.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;It seems our Alchemist Guild has gained three three-star Alchemists in one go.&quot; The woman said with a smile on her face.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;All of you who did not succeed, you can come again next month and sign up for the second exam once again. The ones who have succeeded follow me.&quot; The woman said and left the room. Hui Yue, Zhong Hei, and the third young man followed behind her as they had been told to. All of them were filled with pride as they moved through the front hall of the Alchemist Guild. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Moving through it, they were taken into another room where there were two people waiting for their arrival. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Here you will be gifted a robe which shows that you are part of the Alchemist Guild. While wearing it, you will be given discounts around town and will obviously enjoy some special privileges.&quot; She explained as the three of them accepted the robes. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You also need to get your badge. This badge is important. If you wish to get your discount here in the Alchemist Guild, then you need to show your badge. The higher rank you are, the cheaper the materials will be.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Having explained this, the two items had been gifted to Hui Yue, Zhong Hei, and the young man. However, none of them were eager to wear the cloak. For now, stored them within their storage treasures. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I will take my leave; you are welcome to experience the many things that alchemists use the alchemist guild for; Buy materials, take on quests that have been posted, or sell things you have made to the guild. Anytime you are in need of anything feel free to come to the guild, and we will do all we can to assist you.&quot; She said before she left the room. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was not interested in selling his pastes because he had decided to gift them to the Ma and Rong families, and his first medicinal pill he decided to keep for now.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Buying herbs at the Alchemist Guild was also useless for him as he could get them cheaper from the Ma family&apos;s Black Market Auction House. Therefore, he stored his badge in the Universe Box and with decisive steps started to leave the room.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Hui Yue!&quot; Someone called out to him. As he turned around to look, Hui Yue found that it was Zhong Hei. &quot;I am genuine in my gratitude. I truly wish to do something for you to show my gratitude. If you need anything don&apos;t hesitate to find me, I will be living at the Black Lion for now. You can come find me there at any time.&quot; The young man said before he turned to leave.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing his words Hui Yue&apos;s pupils shrunk and a shiver ran through his spine. This young man Zhong Hei knew far too much about Hui Yue; he even knew that he frequented the Black Lion. The more he learned about Zhong Hei, the more worried he became. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&apos;Don&apos;t worry about him too much. Just don&apos;t contact him again and we should not have to deal with him. I doubt he&apos;ll come looking for you at our mansion.&apos; Lan Feng said with a smile on his face. &apos;Let&#x2019;s rush home. It is about time you learn all the formulas you got from the Ma family and the ones in the Universe Box.&apos; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue agreed and started rushing home. While moving, he thought about the alchemist&apos;s contest. He was interested in joining, but he was not certain if he should. Drawing too much attention to himself was not what he wanted to do right now. What he wanted was to train in peace and quiet. He wished to become a Saint as soon as possible and creating items and pills turned out to be a great way to train. He already had a great many attacks at his disposal, so that was not what he needed to focus on now. He had his beast form, the Nine Tribulation Thunderstorm, the Sword of the Icy Tempest, not to mention Earth Tremor. Learning more abilities would not assist him currently, what he needed was raw power; he needed his internal energies to flow stronger and stronger.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Returning home, Hui Yue found that Huli was not waiting for him in his room but was standing in the hallway, walking back and forth as if she was incredibly impatient.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Huli, I&apos;m back,&quot; He called out, and the cute fox instantly stopped and jumped into his arms. Happiness was clear over her adorable face. &quot;Something good happen?&quot; He asked, and the fox nodded her head. Unfortunately, it was impossible to tell what had happened as the fox could not communicate. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Come with me; I need to train some more,&quot; He said, and the smile on his face froze slightly as he was reminded once more that Sha Yun had not returned. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Sitting down on the bed, he closed his eyes and found a bag filled with storage stones. Placing all these storage stones within the Universe Box, Hui Yue entered the box with his consciousness. He was instantly greeted by the white-robed spirit.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The spirit was usually haughty, arrogant, and hard to deal with however every time Hui Yue arrived with a large stack of storage stones, the spirit would look at them greedily. If he offered the storage stones, then the spirit was much easier to work with.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue asking the spirit to find something for him was not simple, however, asking to find something and then giving storage stones for trade was the best option. The spirit was always willing to exert a bit of effort to find the items Hui Yue was in need of. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;What can I do for you today?&quot; The spirit asked curiously as he saw the large stack of storage stones in front of Hui Yue. It was clear that he wanted them as soon as possible. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I am in need of all the formulas for an alchemist which the old man left behind,&quot; Hui Yue said but the words just caused the spirit to snort. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You want all the formulas, but you only brought that many stones? What we can do is one formula for one stone. I won&apos;t go any cheaper.&quot; The spirit said stubbornly, and Hui Yue was shocked when he heard that there were so many formulas within the vast space of the Universe Box.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;That is fine with me.&quot; Hui Yue hurriedly said with a nod. Although he could not get all the formulas, he would be able to get quite a few. That would make it easier for him to increase the number of pills he could create. The more challenging the pill, the better it was for his internal energy cultivation. Therefore he was willing to study and perfect his alchemy. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The spirit worked quickly and soon a large portion of scrolls appeared in front of Hui Yue. His eyes glistened with excitement as he bowed deeply and left the Universe Box, returning to his body. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Without wasting any time, Hui Yue looked through one formula after another; the more he read, the more excited he became.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&apos;I won&#x2019;t be joining the alchemist&apos;s contest.&quot; Hui Yue finally sighed. &apos;Although I could win by relying on these formulas from another world, it would cause too much commotion if I do it.&quot; Hui Yue sighed deeply while picking up the memory stone containing all the formulas belonging to the Ma family. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Just as he had put the memory stone to his forehead and the information had been transmitted into his mind, he suddenly heard someone running towards him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Yue! Yue!&quot; Wang Ju Long called out. Her voice was hurried, and her eyes shone intensely. &quot;There is news about Sha Yun!&quot; </span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
