He thought that he was now very strong since he was capable of destroying mountains and cutting the seas, he had never expected that the ones who commanded the heavenly dao had such an overwhelming power.</p><p>Hui Yue finished his Ten Suns formation and sent it straight at the Alchemist God. Seven suns burning brightly each larger than the last descended on the world and the temperature in the surroundings rose drastically.</p><p>&quot;Well done! Formations are a different kind of strength, and this formation is surely out of the ordinary. If I don&apos;t remember incorrectly, it is called the Ten Suns formation and the scroll was within the Universe Box.&quot;</p><p>Having said this, the Alchemist God lifted his hand and waved it, and with that one wave, the seven suns vanished. There were no ripples of energy and no signs that it had even existed in the first place. It had been completely overpowered with but a simple wave of his hand!</p><p>Hui Yue was stunned, but he understood that this was someone far more powerful than him. He had to constantly attack the Alchemist God, but at the same time, he also had to avoid being attacked.</p><p>Just now he felt that something was coming for him, so he scrambled away from his position and headed for another wall he had created with his dao of earth. But the moment he was visible, the Alchemist God once more waved his hand, and all the large walls collapsed.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t hide.&quot; He said, his voice still casual and carefree, and Hui Yue understood that he had to go face-to-face with the Alchemist God if he wished to not be bullied too bad.</p><p>He summoned the dao of fire, the dao of earth, and the dao of wind. He also reached out for the star, the figure in his core, and his dao of time and dao of space were also being used to their limits.</p><p>Spacelocks appeared around the Alchemist God, but they crumbled almost instantly. Similarly, using the dao of time to try and change the passing of time for the Alchemist God had no effect.</p><p>Windblades were created and started to cut at the Alchemist God, but when making contact with his body nothing happened. Orbs of fire and sea of flames appeared, but they were extinguished with a wave of his hand. Earth spikes, earthquakes, and a large fist made of soil didn&#x2019;t slow him down in the slightest.</p><p>&quot;This is not fair!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed as he dodged to the side because a pill came flying at him.</p><p>One could argue that a pill was in no way dangerous, but it had been shot forward with such power that it had become a dangerous projectile that was impossible to stop, and the momentum behind it was enough to cause great damage to anyone and anything it hit.</p><p>Dodging to the side, he saw the pill turned to dust as it drilled a great hole into the stage floor of the arena. If it had touched Hui Yue, although he had a perfect body, he would have been injured.</p><p>&quot;Fair? Who said this would be fair?&quot; The Alchemist God chuckled as he sent another three pills towards Hui Yue who had to do everything in his power to avoid them. Three out of four paths had been blocked, and he knew he had no other option than to retreat.</p><p>&quot;This is to teach you the difference between those who have comprehended a heavenly dao and those who have comprehended a major dao.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You might be strong, but there is are still a handful of people in this galaxy who have comprehended even more. They are the true rulers, only below the Overlords themselves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fight!&quot; The Alchemist God said as another four pills rushed towards Hui Yue. He knew that this time he could not avoid all four. Having to pick one of them to hit him, he chose to move towards one, and then he tried to narrowly escape its path, but it still cut straight past his thigh destroying his clothes and drawing blood.</p><p>Hui Yue responded in a flash. Just as when he waved the Sword of the Icy Tempest, he managed to summon forth the freezing temperature. Snow started falling, and he could use the sword to deflect the pills.</p><p>&quot;Damn these pills are too powerful!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed in shock. After deflecting one of them and feeling how his hand trembled and the sword almost broke apart. There was simply too much power within the pills that were sent towards him.</p><p>&quot;Honored master, is this not a waste of pills?&quot; Hui Yue yelled as he kept jumping back and forth. He was rather frantic. It was clear that the Alchemist God was just playing with him, but more and more wounds appeared on his body.</p><p>He dared not deflect more than absolutely necessary because he knew that if he deflected too many, then his treasured sword would show signs of cracking and then break.</p><p>Although the Sword of Icy Tempest was not a treasure on the same level as those sentient treasures, it was still a treasure that had been refined through the Nine Heaven&apos;s Blood Forging, but next to these ordinary pills, it was rather hard to measure up because of the sheer power that was behind them.</p><p>Even Little Green who was watching the battle could not help but feel that the Alchemist God was truly bullying Hui Yue.</p><p>Hui Yue was using every single dao that he knew of, he was using every attack that he knew. He had exhausted his soulforce trying to determine where the pills would arrive next, how to avoid them, or how to be injured the least.</p><p>Now he was exhausted and had no other option than to use Ancestral Worldpower to cover his entire body in a protective layer. He could not move as fast as he could at the start, he could only just avoid the majority of the pills, but more and more came to make wounds on his body.</p><p>&quot;You are pretty good at taking a beating, not giving up as long as you have just the slightest bit of energy,&quot; the Alchemist God nodded his head and approved of Hui Yue with a single glance.</p><p>But, although he approved of Hui Yue, he did not let up on his attacks at all. He continued to attack ruthlessly, sending pill after pill towards Hui Yue and beating him black and blue.</p><p>He did not stop before Hui Yue was completely exhausted and could no longer move.</p><p>&quot;Sparring with you has been fun,&quot; the Alchemist God said shamelessly as he looked at Hui Yue with a grin on his face. &quot;You never give up even in the face of complete strength, but although this might have seemed like me bullying you, it has pushed you past your limits and allowed you to get more used to your body.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. He was aware that what the Alchemist God said was correct.</p><p>Although he had been beaten badly, he had been forced to fight for a long time. During this battle, he had needed to spend his full effort not to get beaten silly, and he had also felt that his soul and body had fully merged with one another. They no longer felt foreign to one another.</p><p>Another pill was thrown out, but this time it was without much force, and the pill landed right in front of Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;Take this one, make sure to be ready for your next lesson in an hour.&quot; Having said this, the Alchemist God turned to leave, and Little Green quickly took her leave with him.</p><p>After this, Hui Yue spent ten hours a day learning from the Alchemist God and ten hours refining a body. After this, he would relax the final four hours of the day, refine Ancestral Worldpower, and simply just talk with the three women.</p><p>Wang Ju Long had become a God all of a sudden, and he did not want to waste her time. She had gained a very good understanding of the dao of darkness because her time as just a soul made her very perceptive when it came to this specific dao. Therefore, Hui Yue could not help but wonder whether or not she would be even better at the heavenly dao of death when she reached that level.</p><p>Wang Ju Long did not waste any time. She spent four hours together with Hui Yue, but after this, she would spend all her time cultivating. She was not going to allow for herself to fall behind. She had always been a superior cultivator, someone above her peers, yet now she was not as strong as the others, and it was clear that this bothered her.</p><p>Hui Yue was not always successful in refining his bodies. He had reached a successful refinement rate of seventy-five percent, but even so, many materials were wasted while he was creating bodies for his friends.</p><p>As soon as the friends returned from their travels, they would stay in the sect until they had gotten a body, and afterwards, they would move to the sparring field and get used to their new bodies.</p><p>None of them had the privilege of being taught by the Alchemist God, and therefore it took them up to a week to grow into their new bodies.</p><p>The third to get a body was Sha Yun. When she entered the body, Hui Yue was very curious as to whether or not she would end up with human legs, but after merging with the soul, she still had her snake tail.</p><p>The Alchemist God also refined another body; this was a body for Xiao Hui. Although Xiao Hui was extremely adept at concocting pills and alchemy, he had never refined a body before.</p><p>No one had thought that it was even possible to refine a body before the Alchemist God had done so, and since he had never had the power to do so while speaking with Xiao Hui in this world of herbs, it wasn&apos;t a technique he passed on to him.</p><p>Now that the Alchemist God could finally teach Xiao Hui a bit about refining he did not hold back and taught him everything he knew.</p><p>Hui Yue did not feel jealous about this. He understood that most of what he had already learned was something that the Alchemist God had learned from Xiao Hui.</p><p>Hui Yue was eager to have a body for everyone, but he was also aware that he could not leave this world before he had learned everything that the Alchemist God had to teach him.</p><p>He was his legacy apprentice; it was only natural for him to learn all the skills of his master.</p><p>&quot;Teacher, will you be coming back with us to the outside world or do you plan on staying within the Archaic World?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously.</p><p>&quot;I plan on staying,&quot; he said seriously. &quot;This is heaven for an alchemist. The world is as stable as can be. There are sylphs and spirits hiding all over the world, and there are all the materials I could ever dream about here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are few things that could make me leave this world. So right now I do not feel like moving anywhere else. But do not worry, I will do what I can to impart all my knowledge to you within another year.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. It was partly sad and partly exciting to know that his time with the Alchemist God was coming to an end.</p><p>He had searched for the Alchemist God for quite some time. He had known that meeting this man would be a major event in his life that brought earth-shattering changes to himself and all his friends, and this was indeed the case.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
