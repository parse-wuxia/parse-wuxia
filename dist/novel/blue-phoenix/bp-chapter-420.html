The Butterfly&apos;s pill was an incredibly rare poisonous pill. It was a pill which could kill anyone without a doubt. It did not matter if the person was a Saint or a Disciple. No matter who they were, they would die. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Such a poisonous pill was exactly what Wang Ju Long wished to have in her collection to study. If she had time to examine the pill she should be able to use her ability to create some new poisons on her own. Although it was impossible to copy this pill or any other medicine made by an alchemist, Wang Ju Long was good at copying and creating poison powder inspired by the pills she had examined.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Raising her sign, Wang Ju Long was the first person to bid on the pill. Both she and Hu Yue hoped that no one else wished to purchase such a unique item. Unfortunately, it turned out that they were mistaken. Three signs were raised after one another, and the price was close to seventy gold coins by the time Wang Ju Long placed yet another bid. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The bidding started slowing down, and suddenly there were only two experts left to struggle against each other. One of the experts was Wang Ju Long, and the other was an elderly man near the front. Both were incredibly stubborn as neither backed down and seeing this everyone turned completely silent, curious to see who would win the pill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While these experts were watching Wang Ju Long, their eyes also landed on Lao, Jo, and Hui Yue. See these two their eyes opened wide from shock and their jaws dropped.</span></p><br><p><span style="">It was clear that these two children were King ranked experts and the man by their side was without a doubt the Grand Marshal of the Beast Army.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The elderly man also noticed the power of the group which Wang Ju Long came from. &quot;My life is more important than this pill,&quot; The man mumbled to himself, but even so his heart was hurting with longing for the poisonous pill. Shaking his head, he could only blame himself for not being strong enough, and a self-mocking smile appeared on his lips as he allowed for Wang Ju Long to make the final bid.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Sold! The winning bid for the Butterfly Pill goes to number four hundred and seventy-four. The final price is ninety-five gold coins!&quot; The woman on stage was almost as ecstatic as Wang Ju Long. Selling poison pills was usually not profitable in the least. One needed to be interested in poison to even start which excluded many people. Almost everyone considered it is a skill for cowards, so nobody chose that path. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Even so, today quite a few such pills had appeared and the price they sold at was quite high; she would make quite a bit from commission.</span></p><br><p><span style="">On the other hand, Wang Ju Long had saved up money for years while healing people and she had the ten spirit coins that Hui Yue gifted her. The price was not something that made her depressed. She was willing to use more than half of her money to purchase the pill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Next, we will be staying in the world of poisons.&quot; The beautiful woman said as yet another pill was placed on the stage near her. &quot;This poisonous pill is different from the Butterfly&apos;s Pill. This is known as the Blood Corroding Pill. It is a slow moving poison. When someone ingests this pill, their blood will very slowly start to corrode. It is, like the Butterfly&apos;s Pill as there is no antidote, but this pill does not work on Saint ranked experts, only Emperors and below.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue looked at his lover to see whether or not she was interested in this poison as well, but her eyes were filled with uncertainty. The pill only worked on Emperors, and she knew the people Hui Yue fought were almost all Saints. She wanted to be useful to him, and therefore this pill was too weak.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Let us start the sale of this Blood Corroding Pill at fifty gold coins!&quot; The woman called out excitedly, but the excitement quickly turned sour when she noticed that Wang Ju Long did not want the item.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The elder man, however, did not feel depressed about the fact that she was not bidding, to him, this was the perfect chance. He did everything in his power to win the pill. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Although a few others bid on the pill, they quickly backed out, and the elderly man won it for seventy gold coins.</span></p><br><p><span style="">He was so excited that his eyes were shining. They shone with even more greed when the next poison pill appeared on the stage. In total seven poison pills appeared. Wang Ju Long purchased every one which was effective against Saints. Unfortunately, there were only three such pills, and so the elderly man purchased the other four. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The elderly man had quickly understood that the ones Wang Ju Long was bidding on were things she truly wanted and he did not feel like going into a bidding war with someone who had so much influence. If they got annoyed by him pushing the price up, it was very likely they would find him to get revenge. He decided not to upset them and he still got his hands on four poison pills because of this he was very excited.</span></p><br><p><span style="">After the poisons were auctioned, the pills which Lao was interested in appeared. These were pills which boosted one&#x2019;s affinity for their elemental. He bought a large portion of such pills, and a satisfied smile appeared on his face after the round of bidding was finished. Although he had almost spent all the money that Hui Yue had given him, he knew it was a good investment. This would allow for his strength to increase by an amazing amount.</span></p><br><p><span style="">After these pills, it was time for pills with Yin energy to appear. Hui Yue was surprised when he saw that some of the pills were the white pills from the grave. While other pills also had Yin energy, none of them were as potent as the pills from the grave. To Hui Yue, it was obvious why this was the case. The owner of the grave was from another world, a heavenly world, and therefore it was natural that his pills were far more outstanding than the pills which originated from this lower ranked world.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The fight for the Yin pills was incredible to watch. So many experts wanted to buy the Yin pills that they were willing to pay an extravagant price to gain them. Some of them even reached the price of one spirit coin.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The ordinary Yin pills were also interesting for some of the poorer families, those who could not afford to participate in the bidding wars of the more outstanding pills. </span></p><br><p><span style="">As the final Yin pill was sold, the Yang pills appeared. This caused Jo to instantly move to the edge of her seat as she held her sign ready to bid.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as the pill was introduced Jo lifted her hand and called out with a clear voice, &quot;one spirit coin!&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">The voice resounded through the entire auction, and everyone was floored by the high bid. Even Hui Yue was taken by surprise as he heard her voice, but after a second a smile appeared on his lips. There were a total of ten Yang pills of various strength, and it just so happened that she had the same amount of spirit coins.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Thinking about it, Hui Yue was not very surprised. They needed to have Yang pills for every single day of auctions so it was only natural that they would only sell ten a day. It had been the same with the Yin pills. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The young lady four hundred and seventy-five has bid one spirit coin. Anyone wishing to bid higher?&quot; The lady on stage asked with a large smile on her face. The prices she had gotten during this auction were definitely satisfactory. </span></p><br><p><span style="">No one called out and Jo won the first pill. The second pill came out, and the same happened followed by the third pill. Everyone seated at the auction was starting to get a headache; it was clear that Jo was not willing to let even one of the pills go. Her clear voice kept resounding through the area, and everyone looked at her only to see a young child with a terrifying aura. The entire group she was a part of was terrifying.</span></p><br><p><span style="">After the sale of the last Yang pill various miscellaneous pills appeared. Some made it possible to change one&apos;s appearance or aura. Another made it possible to completely hide one&apos;s aura. One could make you invisible, and another could make you countless times more attractive. Many of these pills, although useful in some situations, were not usually very expensive, they were mostly fun or entertaining. The auction ended with the customers in a great mood, having laughed at what these pills were capable of doing.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Let us pick up the pills before we return to the marketplaces.&quot; Hui Yue said as the auction ended, and with a flick of his hand, a new golden coin storage stone appeared which he gave Jo. She had spent all the money she had. Although she had saved up some money previously, all of it had been used on food, and the money Hui Yue had given her, had all been spent on Yang pills. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Here is another ten spirit coins.&quot; He said, and afterward he also filled Lao&apos;s golden storage stone with more spirit coins. Neither Lao nor Jo rejected them, but Hui Yue could see that Wang Ju Long was not going to accept them. With a sigh, he could do nothing but put the coins for her back.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Master Hui!&quot; Someone called out as a middle-aged man came towards them, his hand waving and a smile was on his face. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;General Ji,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile towards the person coming their way. He had met this general while heading to the Grave of the Unknown. He had been working under the third prince at the time, but who he was working for now, Hui Yue did not know.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;To meet mister Hui here and have the honor to see these two outstanding geniuses, perhaps you can introduce me?&quot; He said with a smile on his face. It was clear that his intention was to befriend the two children, but neither Lao nor Jo were dumb. They could instantly see his intention but even still they smiled at the elder.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;General Ji, these are my two children, little Lao and little Jo. It is indeed true that they are geniuses, they have managed to reach the King rank at such a young age. We are very proud of them.&quot; He said with a smile while looking dotingly at the two children.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing the words, General Ji was shocked. Not only him, but many experts had been hanging around to hear the conversation between the general and Hui Yue. When they confirmed their assumption that the children were, in fact, Kings, they were deeply shaken inside. Their cultivation speed was truly monstrous. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;General, you&#x2019;ll have to excuse us, we need to pick up our items.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile before he gently led his family towards the desk were one paid for the pills they had won. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Father, aren&apos;t we too abnormal?&quot; Lao suddenly asked as he looked at Hui Yue, but the older man just patted his head. &quot;Abnormal? Perhaps. But I do not care about stuff like this. I want you to be safe. Your life is far more important than being normal.&quot; Hui Yue said solemnly, and Lao nodded his head. Who cared if they were abnormal. What was important was the fact that they could become strong.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
