The Deng family had somehow gotten hold of an outstanding mechanism that no outsider to the family knew much about.</span></p><br><p><span style="">It was obvious that these mechanisms were hidden beneath stone and wooden sheds close&#xA0;</span><span style="">to the rivers outside Riluo City. They were currently constructing over seven&#xA0;</span><span style="">different buildings all at once.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The Deng family also sent out a message conveying that they would buy all the land&#xA0;</span><span style="">available at a river with a strong current and that they would reward the&#xA0;</span><span style="">sellers handsomely.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The first of these buildings were finished half a year after they started the&#xA0;</span><span style="">construction, and the winter was now retreating. The snow was melting but the&#xA0;</span><span style="">cold winds and short days still had precedence in the season.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The news about the Deng family gaining these blueprints from Li Fen, the esteemed expert,&#xA0;</span><span style="">had caused the Deng family to have the upper hand within Riluo City, and&#xA0;</span><span style="">currently they were the strongest family, not counting the Rong family.</span></p><br><p><span style="">During this half year Hui Yue had fought a brave battle against his cultivation and had&#xA0;</span><span style="">reached the peak level of the ninth-star Student rank, however, he felt as if&#xA0;</span><span style="">something was missing for him to be able to make a further breakthrough.</span></p><br><p><span style="">At least Hui Yue was in no hurry as he walked around the academy grounds. He was&#xA0;</span><span style="">satisfied with his current cultivation and as he was now, there was no longer&#xA0;</span><span style="">any use for his medicinal pills so he had gifted them to the Rong twins as a&#xA0;</span><span style="">token of gratitude.</span></p><br><p><span style="">At first the two of them had refused to accept the pills, only conceding when Hui Yue&#xA0;</span><span style="">said that he had bought them for money he had gained from the Black Market&#xA0;</span><span style="">Auction House and that he would feel much better if they would accept his&#xA0;</span><span style="">gratitude.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Having said that much, the Rong twins could no longer decline and took the pills, happiness&#xA0;</span><span style="">evident upon their faces as they quickly excused themselves, heading straight&#xA0;</span><span style="">to their individual courtyards.</span></p><br><p><span style="">During this past half year the relationship between Deng Wu and Hui Yue had grown&#xA0;</span><span style="">increasingly friendly. The two of them shared a big secret which they would&#xA0;</span><span style="">never be able to tell anyone else about, and at the same time they also wished&#xA0;</span><span style="">to find a way to use these esteemed experts&#x2019; knowledges in the best way.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Qing had given Hui Yue a list of certain plants he should eat at specific times every&#xA0;</span><span style="">day and they would help him in increasing the amount of essence he could gather&#xA0;</span><span style="">at a time, in turn increasing the amount of Qi that he could refine at any&#xA0;</span><span style="">given time.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue in turn informed Qing how Lan Feng had broken the seal, but unfortunately stabbing&#xA0;</span><span style="">someone&#x2019;s heart was not a very useful attempt for Qing.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Firstly, if he were to stab someone in the heart, the two of them would die. Unlike Lan&#xA0;</span><span style="">Feng, Qing had not gathered up all his energy within the past four thousand&#xA0;</span><span style="">years, instead he had been sharing it with Deng Wu in allowing him to advance&#xA0;</span><span style="">by leaps and bounds.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Secondly, even if little dragon had been capable of stabbing someone in the heart and&#xA0;</span><span style="">successfully create a reincarnation, they would once again be at least ten&#xA0;</span><span style="">years behind.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue knew that little dragon currently was mainly used as a talisman which could&#xA0;</span><span style="">disguise Deng Wu&#x2019;s true cultivation and at the same time see through all&#xA0;</span><span style="">disguises and provide good advice. However, Qing could not transfer any of&#xA0;</span><span style="">his martial art skills, and eventually Hui Yue gifted one to Deng Wu.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The skill Hui Yue gifted to Deng Wu was as highly ranked as the ones he himself used.&#xA0;</span><span style="">It was a skill known as Dancing Qi Pillar and it&#x2019;s as a High Duke Ranked Martial&#xA0;</span><span style="">Art Attack Skill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">This skill solidified Qi into a pillar of light which would move around based on the&#xA0;</span><span style="">owner&#x2019;s will and intentions. Those who got struck by the pillar would suffer&#xA0;</span><span style="">tremendous damage. Although Hui Yue liked the name and the skill, he was aware&#xA0;</span><span style="">that his Transforming Weapons was far superior in strength and he could not&#xA0;</span><span style="">spend time on learning all these skills just yet.</span></p><br><p><span style="">For those around Hui Yue and Deng Wu, it was interesting to see how the two of them&#xA0;</span><span style="">interacted; no one felt as if it was their place to comment on it and instead&#xA0;</span><span style="">they enjoyed how Deng Wu had calmed down and became an almost normal youngster.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was sitting inside the classroom, looking outside at the frozen ground and wondered&#xA0;</span><span style="">how long it would take before summer returned. He had long since decided to&#xA0;</span><span style="">quit searching for more information about the Great Sin and the Dark Age as&#xA0;</span><span style="">nothing seemed to be available to him and instead he prioritized growing&#xA0;</span><span style="">stronger.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Everyone within the academy kept telling him that one day he would get to know about the&#xA0;</span><span style="">Dark Age. One day when he was old enough. So for now, gathering strength was&#xA0;</span><span style="">what mattered.</span></p><br><p><span style="">In the other end of the classroom was Wang Ju Long, present like always, however, this&#xA0;</span><span style="">day he was not meditating as he usually did, instead he was staring at teacher&#xA0;</span><span style="">Li Yuan with great interest.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&#x201C;Students,&#x201D; he said with a tired voice and shocked expression as he noticed that both of&#xA0;</span><span style="">his star students were actually paying attention to him this day. &#x201C;As you most&#xA0;</span><span style="">likely know already, the Riluo City&#x2019;s Royal Academy tournament is going to take&#xA0;</span><span style="">place next month. I need to sign you up for this. Everyone is required to&#xA0;</span><span style="">attend, and everyone will gain a price.&#x201D;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue and Wang Ju Long looked at each other, both pairs of eyes were filled with a&#xA0;</span><span style="">stubbornness and an urge to fight, which caused their teacher to sigh deeply.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue rushed down and signed up on the papers teacher Li Yuan had brought, and Wang&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ju Long followed right behind before doing the same.</span></p><br><p><span style="">After signing up, the teacher ended the lesson and gave the youngsters a paper with&#xA0;</span><span style="">the general information about the tournament.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The tournament had eight groups of a thousand in each group. The groups were split&#xA0;</span><span style="">up into which year they were from. The fights were then split into lower&#xA0;</span><span style="">brackets and it was an instant knock out tournament.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Eventually, after winning in one of the eight groups, they would fight another group before&#xA0;</span><span style="">they would qualify to the semi-finals and from there to the final itself.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The prizes were extravagant. Everyone were to get at least a medicinal pill; however, what&#xA0;</span><span style="">really interested Hui Yue was the prices given to the top eight.</span></p><br><p><span style="">First prize was a set of leather armour inscribed with lower ranked spiritual inscriptions.&#xA0;</span><span style="">These inscriptions were capable of deflecting the majority of attacks from foes&#xA0;</span><span style="">of equal strength or below.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The second prize was twenty Qi Congregating Pills which would make any cultivator salivate&#xA0;</span><span style="">just by thinking about it.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The third prize was a set of leather gloves which had been inscribed with a specific&#xA0;</span><span style="">attack inscription, allowing a single fireball to be shot out every half hour.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The rest of the top eight were to get ten Qi Congregating Pills each.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Another prize, which did not matter much to Hui Yue, was that the top two in each of&#xA0;</span><span style="">the eight groups were allowed to move into one of the courtyards located at the&#xA0;</span><span style="">various mountain tops, and those courtyards were enough to make most of the&#xA0;</span><span style="">commoner students gasp in surprise.</span></p><br><p><span style="">This was the Riluo City&#x2019;s Royal Academy Tournament, thus it was held for an audience&#xA0;</span><span style="">consisting of the entire Riluo City, however, compared to the Royal Academy&#xA0;</span><span style="">Tournament which took place three months from now in the capital, this was&#xA0;</span><span style="">nothing but a small gathering.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was excited as he left the classroom. It was finally time to try and put all his&#xA0;</span><span style="">effort into practice. He rushed back, although he was not rushing back to his&#xA0;</span><span style="">own courtyard, but instead rushing towards Deng Wu&#x2019;s. It was time to show Wang&#xA0;</span><span style="">Ju Long who was the strongest of the two of them.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was currently standing within Deng Wu&#x2019;s courtyard. His clothes were sticking to his&#xA0;</span><span style="">body as sweat was dripping down his back and his face. The last three hours had&#xA0;</span><span style="">been used for sparring against Deng Wu and Hui Yue finally allowed a smile to&#xA0;</span><span style="">appear on his face.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are a monster,&#x201D; Deng Wu said, shocked as he looked at all the damage which had been&#xA0;</span><span style="">done to his home. &#x201C;Young master Wang is definitely in for a surprise, however,&#xA0;</span><span style="">you forget that I am also participating in the tournament and so far you can&#x2019;t&#xA0;</span><span style="">beat me.&#x201D;</span></p><br><p><span style="">A smile adorned Deng Wu&#x2019;s face, however, it quickly disappeared when he noticed the&#xA0;</span><span style="">smug grin which Hui Yue was displaying.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true, but are you likely to allow your true cultivation base to be shown?&#x201D; he&#xA0;</span><span style="">asked mischievously, &#x201C;I doubt you will actually manage to get through to top&#xA0;</span><span style="">eight unless you unleash at least some of it.&#x201D;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Deng Wu remembered that it was indeed true that no one else knew about his strength and&#xA0;</span><span style="">an average talent was not supposed to suddenly jump this much in his&#xA0;</span><span style="">cultivation base.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right,&#x201D; he sighed dejectedly. &#x201C;You better win this thing for me then. I will look forward&#xA0;</span><span style="">to see how you do.&#x201D;</span></p><br><p><span style="">The smile upon Hui Yue&#x2019;s face widened and he gave a thumbs up before he rushed out of the&#xA0;</span><span style="">courtyard, running towards his own home.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Returning home to his own courtyard, a smile was still evident on Hui Yue&#x2019;s face as he&#xA0;</span><span style="">swirled his hands and two knives appeared. These knives were white as the&#xA0;</span><span style="">finest jade and crackling with pure energy. The knives were both as long as Hui&#xA0;</span><span style="">Yue&#x2019;s forearms and the handles were fit perfectly to Hui Yue&#x2019;s hands.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue knew that Transforming Weapons without a doubt was the most challenging of all&#xA0;</span><span style="">the skills he had practiced so far, and after more than half a year of training&#xA0;</span><span style="">he had only managed to perfect one type of weapon out of the numerous to choose&#xA0;</span><span style="">between.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Back when Hui Yue started practicing, he had realised that his skill at handling knives&#xA0;</span><span style="">was as terrible as if it had the first time he tried wielding it. Back then,&#xA0;</span><span style="">shock had filled the young man as he had assumed that he could easily wield&#xA0;</span><span style="">weapons as he had practiced it for multiple years in his old world. However,&#xA0;</span><span style="">even if he had been using it back then, it was still almost eleven years since&#xA0;</span><span style="">his reincarnation and within these last eleven years, Hui Yue had only focused&#xA0;</span><span style="">on cultivating and learning specific Martial Art Skills.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as Hui Yue noticed that his cultivation was improved on the expense of no longer&#xA0;</span><span style="">being able to remember how to properly move according to his former world&#x2019;s&#xA0;</span><span style="">instructor&#x2019;s teachings, he instantly decided to once again skip the lessons&#xA0;</span><span style="">given by teacher Li Yuan and instead use those additional hours a day to focus on&#xA0;</span><span style="">his wushu training, starting at the basic level.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Although Hui Yue&#x2019;s reincarnated body had never experienced this kind of training before,&#xA0;</span><span style="">he quickly managed to get past the basics as he had previous experience by&#xA0;</span><span style="">soul. Currently, although he was far from his previous abilities, he was still&#xA0;</span><span style="">not one who could easily be defeated.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue&#x2019;s smile grew as he looked at the two knives in his hands and he swirled them&#xA0;</span><span style="">around, playing with them before he moved towards a newly acquired target dummy.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Playing with knives and practicing the body was one thing not usually emphasized within&#xA0;</span><span style="">the academy as the majority of cultivators focused solely on their martial art&#xA0;</span><span style="">skills to deal with both offence and defence, however, Hui Yue had decided to&#xA0;</span><span style="">combine his martial art skills together with his previous knowledge. This way&#xA0;</span><span style="">Hui Yue no longer relied solely on the skills but managed to improve them,&#xA0;</span><span style="">merge them, with his own body&#x2019;s movement.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As Hui Yue started practicing this new type of fighting, he had trained only within his&#xA0;</span><span style="">courtyard so that his fighting style did not get revealed before the&#xA0;</span><span style="">tournament. The tournament was time for redemption, the tournament was the time&#xA0;</span><span style="">to show that Hui Yue was not just equal to Wang Ju Long.</span></p><br><p><span style="">He was more than just the white-haired genius. He was a silver monster.</span></p><br><p><span style="">These emotions had caused Hui Yue&#x2019;s training to grow wilder and more intense and&#xA0;</span><span style="">unfortunately the courtyard had paid quite the price for it. The beautiful&#xA0;</span><span style="">walls had been filled with deep gashes, the majority of the trees had been&#xA0;</span><span style="">slashed so deeply that they collapsed and the ground was marred with craters&#xA0;</span><span style="">and slashes.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue had eventually needed to get help from a grandmaster with an elemental affinity of&#xA0;</span><span style="">wood. Wood was the affinity which allowed for life to spring forth and this&#xA0;</span><span style="">cultivator managed to return the courtyard to its previous appearance.</span></p><br><p>The price to restore the courtyard was an extravagant seven spirit coins, as Hui Yue required that she swear a blood contract never to reveal the fact that she had worked for him. Still, he found that the money was well spent.</p><br><p><span style="">The day after, he purchased a few target dummies created by a Grand Master with Metal&#xA0;</span><span style="">and wood as elemental affinities.</span></p><br><p><span style="">These target dummies were shaped as humans and they were adorned with inscriptions&#xA0;</span><span style="">which allowed them to have different uses. One was to stand still and allow for&#xA0;</span><span style="">the cultivator to hit it constantly where it would repair itself after each hit.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The second option was to activate another inscription and the target dummy would react to&#xA0;</span><span style="">attacks. It had no Qi but it had enough ability to avoid attacks.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Creating the dummy and the inscriptions were done by the metal affinity while the wooden&#xA0;</span><span style="">affinity was used to constantly repair the dummies.</span></p><br><p><span style="">These dummies were without a doubt their weight worth in gold but the price was five&#xA0;</span><span style="">hundred gold coins each.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue once again smiled as he activated his two dummies and got ready for a session&#xA0;</span><span style="">of training. So far, Hui Yue was capable of having his double knives active for&#xA0;</span><span style="">half an hour, and the next half hour the sounds of battle could be heard from&#xA0;</span><span style="">within the courtyard.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&#x2018;Phew,&#x2019; Hui Yue sighed before a yawn contorted his face. Having fought two dummies for&#xA0;</span><span style="">almost three quarters of an hour, as he had exhausted his entire Qi spiral, he&#xA0;</span><span style="">felt tired beyond belief.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&#x2018;It looks quite good,&#x2019; Lan Feng said approvingly after having watched the melee display.&#xA0;</span><span style="">&#x2018;You seem to have perfected the knives and tomorrow you can start playing&#xA0;</span><span style="">around with another type of weapon.&#x2019;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Excitement grew within Hui Yue as he heard this.&#xA0;</span><span style="">He had long since wished to try out a sword, but because of Lan Feng&#x2019;s&#xA0;</span><span style="">requirement of perfecting one thing at a time, he had not tried it out yet.</span></p><br><br><br><br></div><p></p>
