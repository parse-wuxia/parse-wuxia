His previous enthusiasm was nowhere to be found, and Hui Yue could not help but snicker slightly. It was clear that the beasts had acted differently from what he had expected.</p><p dir="ltr">Who these two contrasting humans were, Hui Yue did not know, but their auras were no less than that of the Divine Beast Gods, and their arrival made the beast&apos;s side much more powerful. As it stood now, the demons didn&#x2019;t have a chance.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;And here I thought I could take advantage of Bai Hu being gone.&quot; The demon sighed while shaking his head. &quot;If the four of you are together, and use your formations, then I will have no chance, but the three of you alone are not that dangerous.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Who would have thought that you&apos;d throw away your face and fight me like this! I don&apos;t know if I should be honored or insulted.&quot; The demon&apos;s face was clearly showing that it was no honor but rather an insult. This caused the Azure Dragon to break into a loud laugh which was even more intimidating than when he was overpowering.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We already spoke about this.&quot; He said with a shake of his large head. &quot;You are a fool if you think working together leaves us no face. Even if it did, what truly matters is our lives. If that means that we have to team up against you then so be it. Teaming up against an enemy causes us to lose nothing, not face, not our friends, not our world, and not our lives.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The way the Azure Dragon spoke was filled with strength. He was completely certain in his beliefs, and no matter what the demon said, it was impossible for him to change the opinion of this dragon and his companions so much so that all of them were laughing loudly, mocking the demon in front of them.</p><p dir="ltr">The more they laughed, the more upset the demon became and thus his face twisted with extreme anger. &quot;Good! Good!! Laugh at me all you want to.&quot; The demon said his voice full of anger. As he spoke one purple cloud after another appeared in the sky until the entire heavens were covered. The entire world was lit with a strange purple light.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was feeling worried. This change showed that something dangerous was going to happen, and what worried him the most is that it was in the heavens above. Although he had previously been safe in his crater, this was likely no longer the case.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Glancing around, although Hui Yue was amazed by what was happening in front of him, he found that what interested him the most was finding a safe hiding place. Although this world was but a memory, it seemed that he could still become injured or killed.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I bet this was when they all died.&quot; He thought to himself. &quot;This is something that seems almost impossible to guard against.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s face was pale, and he could not help but curse under his breath. Who on earth made a test like this? It was more like a death trap.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Hui Yue could not help but feel amazed. If he really had to die, then this was not the worst way to go. To see what actual powerhouses were, his horizon had been broadened.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Is An He as strong as these experts?&quot; Hui Yue wondered for some time. Just the thought of him being so powerful caused a shiver to run down his spine. Sighing, Hui Yue could only shake his head. &quot;I still have a long way to go.&quot; He decided.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I wonder if there is something I can hide beneath.&quot; He thought as he looked around. Suddenly, a smile spread on his lips as he darted up from the crater and ran towards the direction of the beasts and demons.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This will be a gamble.&quot; Hui Yue mumbled as he picked up his speed. With a glance at the sky above he ran at his fastest speed towards the Black Turtle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Like an arrow shot from a bow, Hui Yue covered the ground towards the four Divine Beast Gods much swifter than earlier when he had traversed the same distance. The urgency was what made him panic and push his strength to its limits.</p><p dir="ltr">The faces of the Divine Beast Gods and the two human cultivators were grave but not listless, and Hui Yue hoped for all the world that his gamble would pay off. Just the slightest mistake and he would lose his life.</p><p dir="ltr">Reaching the Divine Beast Gods, he instantly headed straight below the turtle, hiding beneath the shell while praying. He prayed that the turtle was not going to lay down while defending itself; that it would not move and that it was able to easily withstand whatever attack was about to be unleashed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue stood beneath the turtle, astonishment filled his face as he noticed that the turtle was still chanting incantations; however, the sound was so low and his lips were not moving so unless one was standing right below him, one would never notice.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly the dimly lit purple sky flashed with a bright light. A bolt of lightning descended from the heavens and made the entire world shudder. Hui Yue could not help but feel a cold sweat start to pour. The energy contained within these lightning bolts was much more fierce than anything he had seen before. Every bolt was more intense than the previous causing mountains to be reduced to stones and powdery mist. Fissures as great as canyons appeared on the ground, and the entire world trembled as it was reformed by this purple tribulation lightning.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at this lightning, Hui Yue was at a loss for words. He had an attack which was slightly similar to this one. He too had the power to call down lightning and summon a tribulation, but comparing it to this was the same as comparing an ant to an elephant. It was not simply a difference in strength, there was also some hidden truths of the world within every bolt of lightning. This was something Hui Yue still had not been able to grasp.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at these many bolts of lightning that descended to the ground, Hui Yue seemed to gain enlightenment. This was what his attack was supposed to be like!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He could summon the nine heaven&#x2019;s tribulation lightning with each bolt being more powerful than the last, but only now did he understand that what he called the nine heaven&#x2019;s tribulations lightning was not the true nine heaven&#x2019;s tribulation lightning! What appeared in front of him was the lightning&#x2019;s true shape.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When the nine heaven&#x2019;s tribulation lightning appeared, the entire sky turned dark purple. As the bolts rained down, the sky changed color! As time went on the sky was no longer purple but red. This red sky rumbled dangerously and allowed the release of even more terrifying lightning bolts. All these lightning bolts destroyed parts of the world, and the demon started laughing once more.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I might not be able to kill you all; I might not be able to take your world, but watch me destroy it!&quot; The mace in his hand was lifted into the sky, and the sky changed from red to dark red before it turned orange and then yellow.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will show you the true nine tribulations that I stole from the Revered Monk&apos;s inheritor. This attack is made to overthrow the heavens! This is an attack to slaughter Gods! An attack to destroy the worlds! How such a pathetic, pacifistic monk like him could ever come up with such an attack, I do not know, but I am forever grateful!!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Hui Yue stiffened. His gaze became hostile, and his blood started boiling. The Revered Monk could only be one person, and this person was him in his previous life! He had merged with this monk, and all the monk&apos;s memories were now shared. It was true that the monk had left a legacy to others, but to think that this demon had personally taken it with force&#x2026; This caused his killing intent to soar.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His previous demeanor of just wanting to see what happened had changed. Hui Yue no longer wished just to see what happened between these powerhouses, he wanted the demon to die.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If he is not already dead then I will personally kill him after An He is gone!&quot; He swore through gritted teeth with anger in his eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue had inherited the monk&#x2019;s calm personality, and despite the fact that he was very influenced by this monk, he had also merged with other memories. Currently, the killing intent from the red wolf was raging within him, but he forced it to be subdued. He was not so stupid as to try anything, this was only a memory after all.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Xuanwu stop playing around. Although we can deal with this kind of tribulation, once it turns black we will no longer be able to do so. If that happens, even if we do not die, our world will definitely collapse!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Calm down.&quot; The turtle grunted, and with a final chanted incantation, his entire body started to shine with a golden light. &quot;The black warrior shows his might.&quot; The beautiful human woman said with a sigh as this golden light slowly expanded. At first, it only covered the Black Turtle&#x2019;s body, but soon it covered all the Divine Beast Gods and the two humans. However, it did not end there. It kept spreading out covering more and more ground with its golden light, and eventually even the demon was covered!</p><p dir="ltr">While the energy did not seem to do anything to the Divine Beast Gods or the two humans, the demon had tried to retreat when he saw the golden light, but when it wrapped itself around him, Hui Yue noticed a look of panic in his eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am not this easily destroyed!&quot; He yelled out and soon the sky turned black as purple energy started to swirl around the demon.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had already expected that these beasts were using their most powerful abilities now. The formation made by the Black Turtle was truly frightening, but the most frightening part was the size of it. It was clear that it was covering the entire world while protecting against the terrifying nine heaven&#x2019;s tribulation lightning. To be able to protect a whole world with one formation, how much power was needed to sustain it?</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not fully understand how much energy was needed, but he knew it was a huge amount, and the fact that the turtle was capable of doing it showed his strength. Hui Yue found this even more terrifying than the nine tribulation attack that the demon had initiated.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at the demon, Hui Yue suddenly felt a pressure so overpowering that he spat out a mouthful of blood. He staggered backward, and his entire body trembled. He had not expected that these Gods had been hiding power all the way up to now, but now the demon was using his full power for the first time! The purple energy around his body was so dense, the killing intent so fierce, that the shockwaves created were absolutely terrifying. Someone like Hui Yue could only withstand them for a short time.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, the formation is in place. I should not fear the lightning bolts any longer!&quot; Hui Yue whispered to himself before he once more retreated from below the turtle&apos;s shell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">At first, moving away was hard. Every step he took was challenging. His body was heavy, and his breath ragged. Blood was falling from the corner of his lips as he felt his internal organs being crushed, but the further away he went, the less pain he was in. Being able to retreat made things much easier on him, and although his speed could not compare to the speed he had while rushing to the safety of the turtle&apos;s shell, he was still quickly moving towards the crater in which he had hidden before.</p><p dir="ltr">Behind him, he felt more and more shockwaves appearing. These had various and different kind of energies within, and feeling them, he knew that a battle had commenced. Still, he dared not stop and turn around to look; he had to hide himself in the crater. Although he was greatly excited about the ongoing battle, keeping his life was the most important task. He had more than one reason to stay alive.</p><br></div><p></p>
