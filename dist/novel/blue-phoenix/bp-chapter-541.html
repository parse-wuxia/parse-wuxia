His other hand came crashing down and landed on his cheek. His leg rose and descended downward on his chest right as his first hand came down again and landed hard on his face once more. After that, he brutally kicked the tower master from above sending him flying towards the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">Just before he hit the ground, another kick landed on the head of the tower master causing him to shoot up into the air again where his face was met by yet another clenched fist which jabbed straight at the side of his head. This series of attacks caused the pained tower master to began losing his consciousness when Hui Yue&#x2019;s leg shot out once more, hitting the tower master&#x2019;s right side. After being kicked, he shot out like a ragged doll slamming into the wall.</p><p dir="ltr">The young man was breathing heavily. He had executed a series of attacks while his body had been covered by the dao of inferno to increase his damage. Every single punch and kick contained the rest of the energy that Hui Yue could currently control, and he had finally succeeded. He had managed to cause the other expert to collapse and lose consciousness.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this, the two Fu brothers were about to enter the tower when they noticed a strange expression on Hui Yue&apos;s face. There was a maniac and stubborn air about him as he moved towards the unconscious tower master.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly a black cauldron appeared in front of Hui Yue. &quot;So you want to refine souls huh?&quot; He asked with a hoarse and weak voice, &quot;well then, let me refine your soul.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The Fu brothers, who were looking in on the room, were shocked when they heard these words, but suddenly the entire chamber turned black. They had no way to see what was going on inside, and although they wished to break in, they dared not do so in case their actions caused Hui Yue to be injured. They did not doubt that whatever had happened was caused by Hui Yue as the unconscious expert had no way of waking up so swiftly. Even they would have suffered under the sudden onslaught of attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">The black energy was indeed summoned by Hui Yue. He had closed his eyes and entered his core where he drew on the strength of the red mist and blue cloud.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The dao of devouring had erupted fueled by his final reserve of Ancestral Worldpower.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Fu brothers outside of the tower were filled with worry when they suddenly heard a loud reverberating wolf howl; a howl of success.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, within the black world, had successfully ripped the soul out of the tower master, and with his tired body, he forced the soul into the chaos cauldron.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Forcing the soul into the chaos cauldron, Hui Yue used his soulforce to refine the soul; the soul changed from a soul of a person to a ball of energy which he could absorb. This soul was the strongest soul he had ever encountered and absorbing it would truly increase his soulforce and his fighting strength. It would also increase the amount of Ancestral Worldpower that he would be able to absorb.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The body of Gods were like a container. It could only hold a specific amount of Ancestral Worldpower. The stronger one&apos;s soul became, the more Ancestral Worldpower one could contain.</p><p dir="ltr">The way to nourish one&apos;s soul was done over time. Being exposed to Ancestral Worldpower would nourish one&apos;s soul, but it could also be done the way Hui Yue was increasing his strength; simply by consuming the souls of others.</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue was in the tower, his friends slowly emerged throughout the mansion. They looted anything worth money, killed anyone who put up resistance, and destroyed anything which did not hold any interest to them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While these Gods were flying to the tower, the young boy was left alone in front of the mansion filled with worry.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will watch out for Hui Yue,&quot; Fu Ziyu assured the others. &quot;While we wait, the rest of you should help evacuate the citizens below.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, the beast Gods instantly did as they were told, but Huli ignored anything that the Fu brothers said and stayed outside the windows that were covered with black energy. Although she was worried, she could feel something familiar from this black energy.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The energy enveloped the room for a full three hours. No sounds came out, no signs of struggle could be heard or seen, and the black energy just stayed in front of the windows blocking everything.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The energy stayed in place for a full three hours before it finally retreated and Hui Yue stepped out of the room. It had only been three hours since he had fought against the tower master and therefore Hui Yue should have still been quite worn out, but the man who appeared in front of them was bursting with energy. His body almost seemed radiant as it was absorbing Ancestral Worldpower from the surrounding areas. They could feel that now he had absorbed more energy than he could hold previously, making the Fu brothers understand that something had made Hui Yue&apos;s strength soar.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The two Fu brothers were shocked, but Hui Yue just ignored them as he flew towards Huli and gently caressed her face as a sad smile appeared on his face.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The souls had already been refined when I arrived at the tower,&quot; he said with a depressed voice. &quot;There was nothing I could do to return them to the circle of reincarnation, and I decided not to waste their energy as it would have just dissipated into the universe anyways.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not lying when he spoke. Although he had absorbed the souls of the mortals, he would have done what he could to return them to the circle of reincarnation if he had the chance. Unfortunately, he did not have this chance. Although he felt sorry for them, he had chosen to absorb their energy. The only other option would be to let them return to the heavens and the earth and become energy for others to absorb.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had not only absorbed the souls of these mortals, but he had also absorbed the soul of the tower master who was the real reason for his sudden increase in power.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Fu brothers had strained their ears to hear what Hui Yue said to Huli and when they heard that he had consumed the souls, they were shocked once more. This young man who had so many secrets also knew the dao of devouring and was capable of consuming souls? Everyone had heard that consuming souls could increase one&#x2019;s strength, but this was the first time they had ever seen it themselves; it had truly shocked them senseless. Fu Ziyu involuntarily took out the glass ball once more and was about to contact Pei Ze when he realized that now was not the best time to do so. Therefore, he quickly put away the glass ball.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Where are the others?&quot; Hui Yue asked as he looked around and noticed that Cai Jie and the beast Gods were nowhere to be seen. Spreading out his soulforce he felt that the ten of them were all at the stables where the humans had been placed, and he instantly flew towards them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Fu brothers followed suit, and Huli was flying right on his side with her arm hooked around Hui Yue&apos;s. Back in his presence, her face filled with happiness.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The young boy who had called for help was standing at the entrance of the stronghold. His face was pale, and his eyes looked anxious.</p><p dir="ltr">The first place that Hui Yue went was to this young boy. When the boy saw Hui Yue, his face lit up with an unexplainable happiness. He finally looked like the child he was.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We finished off the man who has killed all these people,&quot; Hui Yue assured the child. With a wave of his hand, he lifted the child and flew towards the stables.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they arrived, the stench of blood and death was heavy in the air. The beast Gods were opening up all the cages. The humans who had been imprisoned slowly stepped out, their eyes filled with disbelief and their bodies shaking.</p><p dir="ltr">As the last gate was opened, Hui Yue spoke. His voice reverberated through the entire stables so that everyone could hear what he was saying.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have killed the master of this stronghold and his henchmen. We have already destroyed the entire mansion&#x2019;s interior, and there is nothing left here for you. I would suggest you all go back to your homes and cherish your lives.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue landed the child instantly left his side and ran towards the cage where he had been trapped. It was clear that in his heart, although he was filled with gratitude towards the Gods, he was only a child. He could not help but fear what might have happened to his beloved sister.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking through the horde of people and pushing his way into the depths of the cage, the young boy was finally filled with relief when he saw his sister. Her eyes seemed void of hope, and she had collapsed right outside of the cage they had been held in for so long.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sister! Big Sis!&quot; Hui Yue heard the child call out with his clear voice, and the young woman who had been filled with hopelessness opened her eyes. A brief flash of emotion and confusion went through her eyes when she heard the voice, but she quickly descended into hopelessness again.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Big sis I am here! I am fine!&quot; The young child cried out as he held on to his sister with his small hands. Upon seeing him, the woman who had been filled with hopelessness had a face filled with shock. Looking at her younger brother her hands trembled as they touched his soft cheeks; her hands gripped his shoulders hard, and tears welled up in her beautiful eyes before she started crying loudly while hugging the young boy with all her strength.</p><p dir="ltr">The hopelessness she had been feeling slowly vanished. Her body&apos;s strength returned, and her emotions which had been in turmoil since the day he had escaped finally returned to normal.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You stupid child! Why would you try to run away? Don&apos;t you know you could have died?!&quot; The sister scolded but her voice was tender and filled with worry for this child in front of her.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But sister, if I had not run away how could I have gotten help?&quot; He asked slightly indignant. He was very proud of himself. He was filled with relief that he had managed to protect his sister. He had saved her in time!</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing these words, Hui Yue smiled slightly. He knew that she was just filled with worry for her little brother. He was glad to see the two reunite.</p><p dir="ltr">Moving back to the other Gods, he smiled and took to the skies, &quot;Let&#x2019;s go.&quot; He said with a smile on his face. &quot;These humans will manage on their own. We don&apos;t need to worry about them any longer.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There is food here. Get some and go back to your cities,&quot; Hui Yue&apos;s voice sounded through the grounds once more before he scanned the area with his soul force a final time. There were no dangers left within the stronghold, and the humans would be able to manage on their own from now on. It was time to continue on to Youdu.</p><br></div><p></p>
