The pills he could concoct from them would allow one to gain a better attunement towards the dao that the beast had been skilled in.</p><p>Although this kind of pill required other materials as well, it was quite highly ranked among dao comprehension pills, but also one that some looked down upon. This was because it was a more evil method as it required the corpses of either beasts or humans to be created.</p><p>Hui Yue did not care much about the public&#x2019;s opinion on such pills. He understood that if he wanted to feel the other daos, then he would have to use such methods, and he would also need to be in environments that promoted the specific dao.</p><p>But they had fought millions of beasts in the Spirit War, and Hui Yue had so many corpses that selling a mountain of them was not a problem. He had more than what he could use for now, and if he did need more later on then, it was better to either hunt them or buy them at that time.</p><p>Because Hui Yue had so many treasures in his Universe Box, he did not feel that what he took out was anything special.</p><p>Seeing Hui Yue&#x2019;s behavior and all the treasure he had casually taken out, the owner of the realm was greatly shocked. She looked at Hui Yue with incredulity unsure of how to make heads or tails of what she was seeing.</p><p>Hui Yue just kept sipping his tea casually as he narrowed his eyes and observed the elders at work.</p><p>The group of elders would occasionally glance at Hui Yue while discussing lively amongst themselves about how much the current treasure they were evaluating was worth.</p><p>&quot;He was brought here by her! That means he is an esteemed expert and we have to pay a fair price for them,&quot; one of the elders whispered, and the others, although slightly sour at heart, nodded their heads.</p><p>Had this been anyone else then they would have haggled about the price and offered a lower sum to earn more money, but the mistress, herself, had led him here, so it was clear that his status was not low. Since this was the case, there was no way they could cheat him.</p><p>Hui Yue knew of this, and therefore he was quite calm. He knew that his friends had been living off his good graces and almost all the Worldpower Stones they now owned had been gifted from him.</p><p>Therefore splitting up the proceeds from this transaction was quite important to him. The spoils of their trip belonged to all of them, so getting these Worldpower Stones would mean that they had earned the stones themselves and because of this they would feel much better about spending them.</p><p>Hui Yue understood his friends well. Doing something yourself was always better than relying on someone else to do it for you, and the feeling of satisfaction it brought was simply indescribable.</p><p>It took the elders a good four hours to go through every single item in the room and determine how much they were worth.</p><p>After deliberation, they wrote a number on a piece of paper and handed it over to Hui Yue who raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p><p>Worldpower Stones were hard to come by. They could be mined in specific worlds, but the task required a lot of energy and was in no way easy. As a result, they were used as currency.</p><p>Getting a million Worldpower Stones was almost impossible unless someone was extremely powerful, yet right now, on this piece of paper was a price of fifty-seven million Worldpower Stones.</p><p>&quot;This is the best we can pay,&quot; one of the elders said nervously as he looked at the surprised Hui Yue, unable to make out of whether or not he was positively surprised or angry.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ll take it,&quot; Hui Yue said without thinking twice. The price already far exceeded what he had expected to make, and he was sure that his friends would be more than happy to get so many Worldpower Stones.</p><p>The elders were also happy. Although they would be giving out an enormous amount of Worldpower Stones, there was still a margin for profit with the price they had given. They were after all businessmen and earning money was in their blood.</p><p>The profit margin for them, on these items, was around a million worldpower stones. Although it was a lot of money for normal experts, it was truly a small amount for a transaction of this size.</p><p>The Blissful Pavilion was one of the places that sold items to the underground marketplaces throughout the galaxy, and they earned a tidy sum from this partnership. They also had direct contact with collectors and sold directly to the richest experts in the galaxy.</p><p>Many of the things that Hui Yue had displayed were things that they already had buyers for. This was another reason that they dared sell the items at such a high price with such a small profit margin. Having someone who was guaranteed to buy the items from them was a security that they needed.</p><p>Had they not had these collectors and experts in mind, then they would have at most have paid thirty million Worldpower Stones. Generally, they did not want to hold onto items for too long, but since they already had buyers, they were already guaranteed their money back.</p><p>Hui Yue did not care about any of these things. He was no businessman, so he did not know exactly how many thoughts had gone into their consideration before they came up with their offer, all he cared about was earning Worldpower Stones.</p><p>Accepting a storage stone and sweeping through it with his consciousness, he ensured that the right amount of stones were within. Hui Yue smiled and cupped his hands before he left.</p><p>Having gone with him to the Blissful Pavilion could already be considered returning the favor he had shown her by not insisting that her guards perish for their greedy behavior.</p><p>&quot;I have the Worldpower Stones,&quot; Hui Yue said with a great smile on his face as he looked at all his friends that had gathered around him. &quot;There are more than two million Worldpower Stones for each of you!&quot; he exclaimed excitedly as he tossed the storage stone towards Wei who awkwardly caught it. He was afraid to drop and shatter it. If he did then everything that was inside would be lost forever.</p><p>&quot;Share it amongst everyone, and tomorrow we will leave,&quot; Hui Yue laughed, and the others were excited. &quot;I don&apos;t need any,&quot; Lan Feng said lazily as he stretched.</p><p>He had been given a large amount of Worldpower Stones by Hui Yue, and unlike the others, he did not feel bad at all about taking wealth from Hui Yue.</p><p>Hui Yue and Lan Feng&apos;s relationship was closer than blood brothers. They were willing to scale mountains of knives for one another or go through hell and high water for each other&#x2019;s sake. No matter what they would never back down if it were for the other&apos;s sake.</p><p>It was also because of this that everything that belonged to Hui Yue also belonged to Lan Feng. All that belonged to Lan Feng also belonged to Hui Yue. Even their daos were shared, how could they care about something like mere Worldpower Stones?</p><p>The others sent a grateful look towards Lan Feng. They knew he was purposely staying away from the spoils for them to have more, but they also knew that if they said anything, then he would deny it.</p><p>Even Lei, Jo, and Lao were eager to earn their own Worldpower Stones, and their young eyes glistened with excitement as they looked at the storage stone in Wei&apos;s hands.</p><p>Wei felt conflicted. He knew that there was a part for him too... But was that really okay? He was but a simple guard, yet now he would be getting more wealth than he had ever even seen before. He would be so rich that he could live for ages without doing anything.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t think too much about it,&quot; Pei Ziqi smiled as she placed a hand on his shoulder. &quot;We are here to keep him safe, but he would say that we deserve our own fortune. It would be a slap to his face if we did not accept our share. We are more than just guards; we are friends after all.&quot;</p><p>During their travels, Wei had gotten along well with Pei Ziqi. Both of them were here to protect Hui Yue, so they had something in common, and when he listened to her words, his eyes turned slightly red as he nodded his head.</p><p>They were more than just servant and master; they were friends. Being friends meant that they should accept what was given to them.</p><p>In the end, everyone apart from Hui Yue and Lan Feng shared the Worldpower Stones. They each got more than two million stones, and they had a hard time hiding their happiness. The corners of their lips were constantly rising into great smiles that spread across their face without any restraint.</p><p>They bought every single dish in the inn and a great amount of wine and started celebrating in the restaurant downstairs.</p><p>Hui Yue and Lan Feng were laughing when they saw how happy the others were, but they said nothing and just enjoyed the party. All of them drank their fill and ate till their stomachs hurt.</p><p>Laughter constantly erupted from the restaurant as they spoke about their journey so far. All of them were excited and happy.</p><p>Pei Ziqi even told a few stories about her past and the big wars she had participated in.</p><p>Wei talked about life as a member of the Yanluo Guard and his hardships before he became one, and Hui Yue listened happily.</p><p>Suddenly, Huli snuck by his side and placed a hand in his. &quot;I am not saying this because I am impatient,&quot; she began with a frown on her face, &quot;but now we have been engaged for quite some time. I suggest that we finish our business in Youdu and make a body for that dead king guy. Then let&#x2019;s return to the Celestial Sword Sect and marry me, Sha Yun, and Wang Ju Long. I have been waiting for a very long time, and I have to admit that I am getting impatient.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue was surprised, but then his eyes softened as they roamed across the room and landed on Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long who were standing with Jo a bit away laughing and chatting carelessly.</p><p>&quot;I think you are right,&quot; Hui Yue nodded his head. &quot;I think it is indeed time for me to show both you three and the rest of the world how serious I am about you all.&quot;</p><p>Having said this, Huli&apos;s eyes beamed with happiness, and she slung her arms around his neck, hugging him tightly.</p><p>If Hui Yue had been able to see her face, he would see a lonely tear making its way down her cheek and indescribable happiness in her deep, black eyes.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
