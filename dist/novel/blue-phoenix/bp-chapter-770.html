Hearing what they said caused a smirk to appeared on his lips and he couldn&#x2019;t help but once more praise the patriarch.</p><p>He had heard everything they said, and although he hinted at his own cultivation being above the others, he had not known for sure if they understood.</p><p>Whistling a lively tune, Hui Yue followed behind the elder that led him towards a building that was separated from the others.</p><p>He could already hear that the place was bustling with life, and he knew that his friends and servants were waiting for him inside.</p><p>&quot;This mansion is reserved for important guests that visit our Su family,&quot; the elder said with a hint of pride in his voice. &quot;The building is well maintained and always in the most pristine condition. It is ready to be used, but there are only eight bedrooms. Therefore, we only have room for seven of your friends within this mansion including you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The rest have been placed in other guest houses all over the Su family compound, but I am embarrassed to say that they are not as magnificent as this one.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. In fact, he did not mind if they all lived much simpler, but he would never say that out loud.</p><p>&quot;I am sorry for the inconvenience of showing up with such a large entourage,&quot; Hui Yue apologized, and the elder bowed deeply. &quot;I dare not accept your apology; it is our honor to have such an esteemed expert visit us. Should you need anything, do not hesitate to ask the maids. They will do their best to accommodate you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you take a liking to any of the women in this family, please do not hesitate to ask for her either,&quot; the elder continued. &quot;It would be our honor to serve you, and even better if we could be joined in marriage.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue who had looked amiable this whole time suddenly choked on the air he was breathing and almost coughed out loud in shock from what he had been told.</p><p>&quot;Uh, thank you... I guess?&quot; Hui Yue was aware that he was like a celebrity to many of these experts, but he had never expected that the family would be so eager as to throw their own women into marriage just for the sake of getting a better relationship with him.</p><p>&quot;Please feel at ease while you are in the Su family, you can go wherever you please and see whatever you wish to. If you take a liking to anything, then feel free to take it no matter what it is.&quot;</p><p>This was a complete show of faith. To say that he could take whatever was risking the future of the Su family. Either Hui Yue was a young master who disdained everything they had and as a result, would take nothing, or he would take anything that his eyes fell upon now that he had been given the green light.</p><p>Fortunately, for the Su family, Hui Yue was the kind of person who had no greed for other people&apos;s items. Thus he would never covet their treasures; he would leave them be, even if they were priceless.</p><p>Hui Yue and the elder entered the mansion and found his friends. Everywhere they went maids would bow deeply and hurry away.</p><p>Some of them blushed while others panicked, but all of them had their hearts filled with reverence. They had all been handpicked and could be considered beauties. They were exceptionally skilled at what they did, but even so, they would be nervous when they stood in front of such a renowned figure.</p><p>Just as Hui Yue met up with his friends, his soulforce stirred. He felt a group of experts appearing at the edge of his detection, all of whom were approaching rapidly.</p><p>Hui Yue frowned. He did not know why a group of experts would suddenly appear, but he had a bad feeling about it. Could it be that the Blood Demons that had launched an attack?</p><p>But they should be unaware of his strength, and therefore, be sending this group straight to their death.</p><p>Although he could sense that there was one person who had comprehended five major daos, there was no one who had comprehended a heavenly dao amongst them. Thus he did not fear this group.</p><p>Upon further observation, Hui Yue noticed that all of them had brown eyes. None of their eyes were purple so his theory about it being Blood Demons instantly went down the drain.</p><p>&quot;They are most likely from the family that the Su family depends on,&quot; Lan Feng commented with a low voice next to Hui Yue. His face having his trademark mocking smile on it as if he were looking down on the world, and Hui Yue sent him a wry smile.</p><p>After their dance with death, their souls had merged even further. They were now so entangled that it was impossible for one to live if the other died, and it was also possible for them to get a sense of what the other was thinking and not just feel their emotions.</p><p>Although they shared their thoughts and their souls were merged, they were still individual people. They had their own opinions, their own ideas, and their ways of dealing with things alongside their own emotions.</p><p>Hui Yue was not surprised that Lan Feng caught his thoughts about the incoming cultivators as he felt that Lan Feng himself was very curious about it, but when he heard Lan Feng&apos;s reply he felt a little dejected.</p><p>There would be no battle with the demons, these humans had come to gain favor with him, and they had no other aim than to try and see if they could somehow become friendly with the genius of Diyu and the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p>Realizing this, Hui Yue sighed. He turned around and placed his focus on his friends again. Everyone was gathered and looked at him with eyes filled with expectation. Even the Lin siblings were there, looking curious about what was going to happen.</p><p>&quot;We will stay for a few days,&quot; Hui Yue announced. &quot;We will allow for Su Xiaoyun to have a proper goodbye to her ancestors, her family, and her friends. When she has finished, we will set out for Diyu.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The final battle is drawing near. Neither humans nor Blood Demons can continue in a war of attrition like this; we are simply losing far too many people.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have an impression that although the Blood Demons are aiming for us, they have something big planned, and whatever it is, it will spark the final battle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When the final battle occurs we need to have our own half-step Overlords alongside our Overlord ready. We also need as many Heavenly Dao cultivators as possible ready to fight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But all of this is something we will discuss once when we reach Diyu. I need to speak with Yanluo to know exactly what our plans are. We cannot speak on the communication orb because of the chance of being listened in on by someone else.&quot;</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads. Although communication orbs were fairly safe, it was still possible for strong cultivators to listen in on the subjects that were being discussed. If Hui Yue used the dao of life, then he too would be able to listen in on other people&apos;s conversations; he was just not interested in having such a hobby.</p><p>Everyone knew that important information would never be exchanged through communication orbs.</p><p>&quot;Well for the next couple of days, be on your best behavior as we are in the Su family as their guests. Don&apos;t tease or bully anyone and make sure that they have the impression of us being thoroughly polite.&quot;</p><p>Just as he was about to warn them even more, like a worrying mother, something that caused all of them to be filled with tenderness, someone knocked on the door. Hearing it, Hui Yue turned around.</p><p>He was slightly surprised. This group of experts were intruding on the Su family&apos;s compound. Although they were stronger than the Su family, and the Su family depended on them for protection, it was rather rude to go straight to a guest and not announce their arrival to the patriarch and the elders first.</p><p>&quot;Young hero Pei Yue,&quot; someone called out, and Hui Yue waved his hand, causing the door to open.</p><p>&quot;I am Pei Yue,&quot; he replied with an arrogance that had not been there before. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p><p>This arrogance was mainly because he knew that those families expected a certain degree of arrogance in a young master, and because he wanted to act like a young master in front of these people who did not even know proper etiquette.</p><p>Hui Yue had disliked the Su family before arriving, but now that he had met the Su family&#x2019;s patriarch, and understood what he was like, he had taken a liking to him. To see him embarrassed like this did not please Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;I am Zhu Jinyao,&quot; he introduced himself. &quot;An elder of the Zhu family from within the eastern region. We are one of the biggest families within the region and the Su family is under our protection.&quot;</p><p>&quot;One could go as far as to say that when you visit the Su family, you are in fact visiting a branch of our Zhu family.&quot; The elder smiled sleazily and cupped his hands as he leaned in towards Hui Yue. His eyes glistening with greed, and he was expecting Hui Yue to praise him.</p><p>&quot;A branch of the Zhu family?&quot; Hui Yue repeated with laughter. &quot;I understand that the Su family seeks protection from the Zhu family, but Su and Zhu are not the same family. How could they be a branch family of yours?&quot; he asked mockingly, and the elder&apos;s face turned grim.</p><p>It was clear that he had stepped all over the face of the Su family by calling them a branch family. Everyone from the Su family present was feeling uncomfortable, but no one dared to speak out. However, Hui Yue spoke all the words that they were yelling in their head.</p><p>&quot;Senior uncle why are you so polite to this young man? I understand that he is a genius from some sect, but is he really that much better than the rest of us?&quot; a young man spoke out as he entered the room behind the elder of the Zhu family.</p><p>The elder snickered on the inside as he heard this, but on the outside, he stayed humble and hurriedly said. &quot;Don&apos;t talk nonsense, this is a proud son of the heavens, a dragon amongst men! We are as good as mortals next to him; we cannot hope to ever compare with such grace.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, the young man seemed to understand something and nodded his head repeatedly, while Hui Yue just looked at them amused.</p><p>Hui Yue was not new to intrigues; he understood what this elder was planning.</p><p>If he placed Hui Yue on a pedestal, he had nothing to lose. If they truly came to blows, then Hui Yue would lose face, even if he won. Unless he could win with one move.</p><p>This young man was not a genius of one of the major sects of the galaxy. Nor was he a proud son of the heavens as they had named Hui Yue. He was but a genius of the eastern region.</p><p>If he could defeat Hui Yue, he would become the new king of the younger generation; he would be the king of all geniuses in this era.</p><p>If he could last for a period of time, it would still gain him great fame as his opponent was Hui Yue.</p><p>Even if Hui Yue were to win in some way or another, he would be losing as everyone would expect him to win.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
