I do not know how vast the galaxy is, or how skilled the geniuses above me are.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was born in this eastern region and have lived here all my life where my talent has been praised far and wide. Thus I would be honored if you would be so kind as to have a friendly exchange of pointers with me.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue said nothing at first. He just stood there and looked at them with a small smile on his face.</p><p>&quot;You want to spar with me?&quot; He asked amused as if he had heard the best attempt at humor in a long time, and his friends behind him were chuckling when they heard Hui Yue ask this question.</p><p>&quot;Just a friendly spar,&quot; the young man agreed, his face turning slightly red as he was agitated now that they were giggling at him. Was it really that funny for him to ask to spar?</p><p>&quot;Sure, we can have a friendly spar, but are you sure you do not want to challenge one of my friends instead? They are not as strong as I am, but they are capable of providing quite a fight for you.&quot;</p><p>The young man sneered, &quot;I want to see what a real genius is! Don&apos;t tell me that you are afraid?&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, the chuckling from his friends stopped, and their eyes turned dangerously dark. Killing intent started soaring in the room, and the young man unconsciously stepped backward his eyes wide. He started fearing that they might kill him on the spot.</p><p>&quot;Please forgive this young one,&quot; one of the Zhu family elders instantly stepped forward and bowed deeply, &quot;he does not know how to recognize Mount Tai, and accidentally insulted you.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue still just smiled and cocked his head slightly while looking at the young man who had challenged him.</p><p>&quot;Well then, why don&apos;t we have a friendly spar,&quot; he said after a bit of consideration.</p><p>The young man was ecstatic when he heard this. He smiled as if he had already gained a great honor. &quot;You there, lead us to your family&apos;s martial grounds,&quot; he ordered a servant who was standing to the side, and the poor servant was so frightened that she instantly nodded her head.</p><p>&quot;This way young sirs,&quot; she said with a trembling voice as she led Hui Yue, his friends, and the ones from the Zhu family out of the building and towards the fighting grounds.</p><p>Along the way, many of the members of the Su family noticed that something was happening, and the elders of the Zhu family did not mind telling everyone about the exchange of pointers happening. Soon the rumor spread through the entire Su family, and they all gathered at the outdoor grounds, eager to see what this supreme expert was capable of.</p><p>Everyone here knew about the young master from the Zhu family. They knew he was a special person with innate gifts for cultivation and that he was a talented individual who was almost impossible to match in the entire eastern region.</p><p>But they knew nothing about Hui Yue&apos;s true strength, and thus everyone was unsure as for whom they thought would win.</p><p>As they reached the martial grounds, Hui Yue just casually moved to the middle of the arena. His hands were held behind his back, and he looked as casual as could be. He looked as if he did not even put this spar in his eyes.</p><p>His casual demeanor and how he was observing everything around him with great curiosity kept bothering the young master. He grit his teeth, but he understood that he was incapable of doing anything about it.</p><p>If he was even the tiniest bit rude towards Hui Yue, this young master did not doubt that he would end up dead in some ditch, and it would be unknown who of these followers had killed him.</p><p>Although he was sure of his own strength, even he was not blind. He could see that there were a whole bunch of supreme experts, some of them even resembled dao protectors, and if they were truly dao protectors, then they would be very strong indeed. Definitely stronger than him.</p><p>&quot;I will give you ten moves,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile. &quot;I will not attack you, nor will I protect myself; I will just stand here and allow for my body to take your attacks.&quot;</p><p>An uproar exploded forth in the surrounding areas; everyone was stunned at how Hui Yue looked down so much on the young master from the Zhu family. No matter how one looked at it, he was being looked down upon.</p><p>The young master of the Zhu family had comprehended two major daos, and this result was already astonishing for someone his age. He had never before experienced the feeling of being looked down upon, but none of these people were aware that Hui Yue had a refined body. His body and soul had merged with four major daos and a heavenly dao. If he could be wounded by two major daos, then there would be something seriously wrong with him.</p><p>While everyone thought that Hui Yue was arrogant beyond belief and that he would be severely injured, the Zhu family members were all snickering in their hearts certain that they would be able to win this bet. To give ten moves away like that and even say that he would not need to defend, that was the same as throwing away his face.</p><p>On the other hand, Hui Yue&apos;s friends were all calm. They all knew the truth about Hui Yue&apos;s strength, his strong body, and his outstanding daos; they knew that it was impossible for his body to gain even the slightest scratch from this young man.</p><p>They did not mock about, as soon as Hui Yue had spoken, the young master of the Zhu family charged at Hui Yue with a treasured sword in his hands.</p><p>This sword was likely an heirloom item from the Zhu family; it gave off a cold aura as if it was made from ice. The air it crossed started to turn crisp as if it was a frosty morning.</p><p>The slash was brilliant. It was as if ten yeti&apos;s had come to life and the temperature of the entire martial arts ground dropped.</p><p>Still, Hui Yue stood as still as a mountain with a curious expression in his eyes as he looked at the sword.</p><p>The Zhu young master had not superimposed any daos on his sword. All he was using was his bodily strength. Although his sword was a treasured item, it was nothing compared to a body made from rare and priceless materials that had grown in the Archaic World, soaked in Ancestral Worldpower from their birth till they had been harvested thousands of years later.</p><p>The sword descended and landed straight on Hui Yue&apos;s nape of the neck, a metallic sound sounded out, and dust rose from the ground, covering the two of them.</p><p>Hui Yue felt a slight chill on his skin and noticed that his robe had been cut neatly into two. Frost flowers were blooming on either side of the blade, but the skin had not been penetrated, not even a drop of blood had been spilled.</p><p>As the dust slowly lay itself down again, everyone was staring at the two experts that were standing face to face. One with a hideous expression on his face while the other wore a casual, slightly mocking smile.</p><p>&quot;You managed to ruin my clothes. Well I guess that is to be expected, it is a treasured sword after all,&quot; Hui Yue&apos;s voice reverberated through the silent field, and everyone was standing stunned at the sight. This young man had withstood such a powerful attack with his bodily strength alone!</p><p>&quot;I went easy on you!&quot; the young master said through gritted teeth. &quot;I did not use any daos because I did not want to make it unfair for you who said you would depend on your bodily strength to withstand my blows. But it seems that I truly underestimated the geniuses of the younger generation that come from a major family.&quot; He spat out every word as if it was hurting him to say them, but Hui Yue said nothing in return, he just continued smiling a smile that insulted him further.</p><p>The Zhu young master retreated a few steps before two of the major daos in the surrounding air started to swirl around him. It was the major dao of light and darkness, something that surprised Hui Yue greatly. These two major daos were contradictory, but this youngster had still managed to comprehend both of them showing that he had either a great lucky chance or he was very persistent and stubborn.</p><p>Darkness and light intertwined into one another as they superimposed themselves on top of the sword. Shortly after swordlight shot out towards Hui Yue.</p><p>Hui Yue, on the other hand, had promised to stay still during the ten exchanges of blows and to keep his word he steeled himself for the impact.</p><p>Had it been any other two major daos then he would not have had to take it seriously, but these two were opposites, and they strengthened one another.</p><p>As the swordlights landed on him, he felt how his clothes were ripped apart; he noticed that his skin obtained a slightly red mark from every attack, but this time the Zhu young master had used three attacks at once, only to cause a slightly red mark to appear on Hui Yue&apos;s shoulder.</p><p>&quot;This is getting quite embarrassing,&quot; Hui Yue gave an awkward chuckle. &quot;If I didn&apos;t know better then I would assume you were trying to undress me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can&apos;t you aim for my heart or my head or something?&quot; he asked.</p><p>At first, everyone was frightened when they heard this. Aiming for his head would mean that he would have his face injured, and no one would want to see that, but after realizing what it was Hui Yue had said, and looking at how his robe was starting to be in tatters others started giggling. It did indeed seem as if the only result that this young man had gotten was to destroy his clothes. Even the red mark had returned to normal by now.</p><p>The Zhu young master could say nothing. He had already given it his all in the previous attack, but he had been incapable of doing anything. It was not until now that he realized that he truly was a frog at the bottom of a well. Although he had claimed to be one before, he had not truly believed in it, but now that he understood that even his strongest attacks could do nothing to Hui Yue; only now did he understand how weak he was. There was always a taller mountain and stronger cultivator out there; one should never overestimate themselves.</p><p>Feeling despair, he threw out another six attacks in rapid succession, knowing full well that when he finished these ten moves that he had been given, he would be defeated, and rightfully so.</p><p>Just as the final attack landed on Hui Yue&apos;s body, Hui Yue took a step forward. With this step forward he also merged with the heavenly dao of life around him. A strong gale blew, and an explosion of power erupted from Hui Yue&apos;s body. This explosion crashed straight into the chest of young master Zhu, sending him flying for hundreds of meters and spitting up blood.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, it seems I was a little too rough,&quot; Hui Yue apologized, but the truth was he could not have been much gentler. All he had used was the residual energy that came from merging with the heavenly dao of life and that alone had sent him flying.</p><p>There truly was a great difference between the tiers of the dao, and it was not until now that Hui Yue understood just how strong he had truly gotten.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
