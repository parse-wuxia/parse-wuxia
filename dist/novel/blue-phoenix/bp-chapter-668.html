The storage treasures on his body and the treasures he had put up for sale were long gone, and so were the people who had robbed him in broad daylight.</p><p>&quot;You there!&quot; one of the men went towards a stall next to the unconscious man, and his killing intent flickered. His eyes gleamed with hostility as he looked at this merchant.</p><p>&quot;Tell me what happened here!&quot; he demanded, and the man who was selling items could only smile wryly and say exactly what had happened.</p><p>Many could not help but think that the woman from before was too ruthless, while others actually felt that Huli had been lenient. The women present that had seen the incident felt that they would have instantly killed any man who dared suggest such a thing to them.</p><p>But although they thought like this, none of them said anything. The big group of twenty or so experts was truly overwhelming, and their killing intent proved that they were not people one could easily provoke.</p><p>&quot;So they are trying to escape the realm already!&quot; the man who had threatened the seller said with a grim expression on his face. &quot;We need to avenge seventh brother! He was mercilessly beaten up by some slut; I will not accept it. Let us Blood Vultures find them and make this woman our slave!&quot;</p><p>The man exclaimed loudly, and while his own group was energetic and laughing because of it, everyone else looked elsewhere. They could not help but feel that this group called the Blood Vultures were heading straight towards their deaths.</p><p>Yes, their group consisted of twenty members, but their seventh brother was beaten so badly that he could not even fight back. It was clear that if they did not have some extraordinary strength then all of them would face the same fate.</p><p>While this group of mercenaries were causing a ruckus in the ruins, Hui Yue and his friends were heading towards the closest peak. They had no reason to stay within this realm any longer and wished to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>Fortunately, the ruins were situated in between a valley and two large mountain ranges. One of these mountains was taller than the others, and it towered high above the clouds so that one wasn&apos;t able to see the peak of the mountain.</p><p>&quot;Time to climb!&quot; Ye Ling smiled, and the others nodded their heads. Climbing a mountain could be a big task for some, but these experts were all God ranked cultivators, and they could climb the mountain as easily as flipping their hand.</p><p>Flying was not an option, but they managed to get to the top of the mountain in less than half an hour, and as they reached the top, they could feel that the gravity around them was becoming less and less pressuring. As they reached the peak of the mountain, they could no longer feel the pressure of gravity bearing down upon them.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x2019;s go,&quot; Hui Yue sighed and together they all flew into the sky above. It did not take long before they reached the brilliant ring of light that was surrounding the world.</p><p>The group vanished through the light barrier just as another group of experts arrived at the mountain&apos;s peak.</p><p>This group was filled with killing intent, and their arrival was domineering. &quot;You can run, but you cannot hide!&quot; the leader growled, and the group, including a ragged, angered seventh brother, flew straight to the light barrier as well.</p><p>They did not hesitate at all as they exited the world, and started looking around them to see if they could recognize a large group of experts. Especially the seventh brother was looking around eagerly. He was the only one who had seen them before, and thus he knew it was up to him if he wanted to get revenge.</p><p>More than one group of experts were leaving the shining ring surrounding the world, but only two groups were big enough to be the ones they were looking for.</p><p>&quot;There!&quot; the seventh brother said as he saw Huli&apos;s back and instantly recognized her. She was the most alluring woman he had ever seen before, and it was easy for him to recognize her no matter where she was.</p><p>&quot;Pretty,&quot; the leader approved as he nodded his head. &quot;There are also two snake-women. You can keep the woman you found, but the two snake-women are mine,&quot; the leader said while licking his lips.</p><p>The group of brothers and sisters all seemed a little unhappy, but the leader just laughed, &quot;Don&apos;t worry.&quot; He said, &quot;I will share with everyone when I have had my taste. And look at all those men! I am sure our sisters can find a few they like. If not we will just sell them all as slaves.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, the group felt much better. Some were chuckling while others were already dreaming about what they would do with these snake-women.</p><p>&quot;Something is wrong,&quot; Xiao She said with a shudder as if she could sense what these people were speaking about. She turned around to see a group of experts heading for them.</p><p>&quot;Someone is coming!&quot; She exclaimed, and everyone stopped in their tracks. They turned around and looked at the group that was rushing towards them. Many of the men had lecherous expressions on their faces as they looked at Sha Yun and Xiao She.</p><p>&quot;It&#x2019;s that bastard from the marketplace!&quot; Huli instantly recognized him, and she was now in a horrible mood. She still remembered what he had said to her, and looking at him, she could see that he still had some perverted thoughts about her.</p><p>&quot;I should have just killed him!&quot; Huli growled as her feral instincts kicked in. The other beasts all turned hostile as they saw the expressions on the faces of these pursuing experts.</p><p>&quot;Throwing your lives away?&quot; Hui Yue said as he saw the other group rush towards them, and he could not help but smirk. &quot;Well if you think we will be defeated then you will be disappointed!&quot; he chuckled as he withdrew his Sword of the Icy Tempest from the Universe Box.</p><p>The moment he withdrew it, he sent his Ancestral Worldpower into the sword causing the temperature in the surrounding area to drop drastically.</p><p>In the middle of the void, small snowflakes suddenly started to fall, and every one of the enemies they touched turned cold and slowly froze.</p><p>They had to use their Ancestral Worldpower to fight against these snowflakes, and therefore, they could not fully focus on their fight.</p><p>At this point, the leader felt that something was amiss. His group had twenty experts, but the group in front of them had twenty-five experts. There were nine beast Gods, Pei Ziqi, Cai Jie, Hui Yue, Xiao Ning, Ye Ling, Zhu Jun, Luo Qiang, Hui Lei, Jo, Lao, Rong Xing, Deng Wu, Huli, Wei, Sha Yun and Wan Qiao.</p><p>If one just compared total members, Hui Yue&apos;s side held the advantage, but when it came to strength, they might not be stronger. Everyone in the opposing group were Immortals of Creations where only the nine beast gods, Pei Ziqi, Cai Jie, Huli, Wei, and Hui Yue were Immortals of Creation, and only Pei Ziqi, Cai Jie, Huli, Wei and Hui Yue had comprehended a major dao.</p><p>The rest were still trying to comprehend one, and because of this, they were weaker than the others. Still, no one knew how many of these twenty Immortals of Creations had managed to comprehend a major dao.</p><p>&quot;A fight!&quot; Pei Ziqi&apos;s voice was filled with delight. &quot;I love fighting! I was not supposed to fight unless you are in severe danger, but honestly, we&#x2019;ll just say that you are in danger now. Your opponents look strong, and there are so many of them. No one can argue that it isn&#x2019;t a good time for me to help you fight!&quot;</p><p>Pei Ziqi was arguing with herself. Although she was not allowed to join in on too many fights or too many of their plans, she could not help herself when she saw so many powerful experts right in front of her.</p><p>&quot;Screw it, you only live once!&quot; she exclaimed, and suddenly the dao of darkness, the dao of light, and the dao of wind exploded out from her body ready to chop her enemies to bits.</p><p>Hui Yue had never before seen Pei Ziqi fight before, and now that he was watching her, he was rather astonished. He had always known that she was strong, but to think that she had managed to comprehend three major daos on her own was simply outstanding.</p><p>&quot;Well, if I don&apos;t join in soon, the fight will be over before I even kill anyone,&quot; Hui Yue sighed before he yelled out. &quot;A thousand Worldpower Stones to the one who kills the most experts! Also, you get to keep the spoils of war from the ones you kill!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s voice was loud enough for everyone to hear, and the opponent group&apos;s faces turned ugly. Did they think that they would be pushovers?</p><p>The fight had drawn a lot of attention. Some were watching just out of curiosity while others wished to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>If two sides fought each other to a standstill, then they could come in and reap all the rewards.</p><p>Swords slashed against each other and weapons could be heard colliding in midair.</p><p>Explosions sounded out as dao attacks faced dao attacks and people were pushed back all over the place.</p><p>The battleground was chaotic. Jia Na was throwing punch after punch at the opponent in front of him. Every one of his punches were fortified with the dao of tidal waves causing the following fist to constantly contain more and more power as he built momentum and pushed back his opponent.</p><p>Sha Yun was not an Immortal of Creation, and she knew that she stood no chance alone, but she was not worried. Her red whip flashed back and forth while she fought together with Lao, Jo, and Hui Lei.</p><p>Jo took care of all the close combat fighting. After having fought the hellhounds time and time again, she had gained an acute feeling of danger and was able to agilely avoid every attack that would have seriously injured her.</p><p>Sha Yun&apos;s main task was to control their target. Her whip would perfectly keep the opponent incapable of attacking, and they entangled his weapons and arms at times.</p><p>Although he could break free of the whip quickly, he still wasted a short moment every time to do so. During these moments of immobility, Lao and Hui Lei would launch all their attacks at him.</p><p>Although this group were not Immortals of Creation, their cooperation was flawless. They sustained no injuries, and they managed to whittle down their opponent, wounding him time and time again until he could no longer withstand the pressure. Their opponent&#x2019;s body was filled with holes from Earth Spikes, one of Sha Yun&apos;s favorite dao attacks.</p><p>The beast Gods were all at a disadvantage against Immortals of Creations which had comprehended a major dao, but it turned out that most of these experts had not comprehended a major dao. Therefore, they could fight on even footing. Just like Jia Na, all of them had their merged attacks, and thus they slowly gained the upper hand in the confrontations.</p><p>There was a handful of opponents that had comprehended a major dao, but in the end Pei Ziqi took on four experts on her own. When Hui Yue looked at her all he saw was an eager smile that bloomed on her face as she threw attack after attack at these experts, forcing them into a sorry state.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
