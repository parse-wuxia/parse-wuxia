One after another, these experts had appeared and created miracle after miracle. For someone to make an attack which increased all their attributes was already outstanding, but another had managed to create an eternal flame, and one had managed to make a fusion between soul shadows and the fire. Now, even more outstanding was how Ancestral Worldpower had fused with the snake-woman&#x2019;s very own element.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This caused the power of her Earth skills to increase tremendously, and not only that, now all her strength had increased so much that one could not imagine just how strong she had become. Her rank might not have increased, but her combat ability had improved greatly. Her skill was in no way inferior to the original Phoenix Descent in overall strength gained which the divine master created on a whim all those years ago.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Fourteen days had gone by, and now more than half of the group had awakened, and only Jo, Cao Jie, and Hui Yue were left silently contemplating.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It only took an additional day for Jo to wake, and when she did her entire body became a flame. Moving around, she managed to create a whole sea of flames around her. Rings of fire radiated from her body and one ring after another sprung to life. Spreading out, they incinerated the landscape around them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the destructive power, the bull was taken aback. This attack was definitely the most offensive one of all the attacks that had been created so far, and it was clear that Jo&#x2019;s perception when it came to skills was so far the best amongst them all.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The bull could not help but shudder. Although he was strong, and a lot higher ranked than these experts, he had not expected them, especially not the two children, to be as frighteningly sharp as they were. Their talent was truly limitless!</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at Hui Yue, he sighed. It seemed to him that Hui Yue was the leader of this group but of all the experts there was only one whom he feared would not make it past this trail and that person was Hui Yue. He was simply too cool-headed and acted as though the attack he was contemplating upon was not difficult at all seemingly not putting any effort in.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time only Cai Jie and Hui Yue remained contemplating, the time slowly started passing by. Soon three weeks had passed, but neither Hui Yue nor Cai Jie showed any signs of awakening from their trances. At this point, Cai Jie was clearly in pain. His face was twisted in an enduring grimace while Hui Yue still looked as serene as if he were walking through a park.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After five weeks everyone started to worry about Hui Yue. Seeing the changes in Cai Jie&#x2019;s expression day in and day out they understood that he truly was gaining insights into this attack known as the phoenix descent, but Hui Yue did not seem to gain any insight at all. His body was as cold as a deep lake, and not even a trace of heat could be felt from him. Was Hui Yue truly not able to sense this attack? They all had a hard time believing this. Hui Yue was the strongest in their group after all. Continuing without him would be pointless, so their hearts quivered with worry.</p><p dir="ltr">After seven weeks Cai Jie finally opened his eyes. His entire body released a terrifying aura which exploded outwards, and behind him, this Ancestral Worldpower which kept appearing around Cai Jie&#x2019;s body turned into a large flaming sun. This sun was constantly raising and lowering itself as Cai Jie levitated from the ground and behind him, the sun started its descent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The bull was amazed. This was as close to the original Phoenix Descent as he had ever seen. The attack he saw lacked the original shape and a little strength of the original phoenix descent, but it looked very similar. It descended upon the world and covered everything within in a flaming sea which just kept growing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Protecting everyone around him, the bull lifted his arm and a small energy shield appeared in front of everyone. The bull ensured that no one was injured. He was truly astonished and wondered if this was the time that their trial would come to an end. He could not go back on what he had said before. Since there was no time limit to this trial, all he could do was wait for Hui Yue to open his eyes and admit that he had not understood the ability that had been transferred into his mind.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be discouraged.&#x201D; Cai Jie said the moment he noticed Hui Yue&#x2019;s odd appearance. &#x201C;Although he might look different from how we did, remember that Yue has always been different from us. When has something happened which he has not overcome? I believe in him, and I will keep believing in him. Let&#x2019;s wait and see what miracles he will bring.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing Cai Jie&#x2019;s words caused everyone to suddenly feel much better, but the bull was surprised. Cai Jie clearly had the ability to become the leader of this group, yet even so he was not willing to take over. Even now he firmly believed in his martial brother&#x2019;s ability to pass this trial.</p><p dir="ltr">It took an additional month for Hui Yue to open his eyes. When he did the entire world seemed as though it was void of any heat. All of the pressuring atmosphere from before instantly vanished, and all of it seemed to have been swallowed by Hui Yue&#x2019;s body.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this phenomenon the bull was shocked. He could not come up with any reason for what was happening, nor was he able to fully understand it. Something beyond his understanding had been created by a mere Saint!</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at Hui Yue, the bull suddenly felt excited. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see what attack you have comprehended from this ability.&#x201D; He said with great expectations and Hui Yue nodded his head but did not instantly start.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Senior, can you please look after them? Although I can use this attack, without senior&#x2019;s protection, I fear that I will accidentally kill them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, everyone was shocked. An attack so strong that Hui Yue could not control it? An attack so strong that they needed the protection of this senior? Could it be that it was more powerful than the one Cai Jie had created?</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Do not worry about your friends; I will protect them.&#x201D; The bull said excitedly, and just like before small shields of energy surrounded his many friends.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding his head, Hui Yue retreated fifty meters away and as he did his body turned into a blur. Unlike the others the flames that appeared on Hui Yue&#x2019;s body were blue, and his entire body slowly vanished before it took the shape of a large phoenix.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had become this flaming phoenix, and with a few flaps of his wings, the blue flamed phoenix took to the skies and let go of a resounding cry which shook the heavens and earth before he dove straight for the bull and his friends.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The speed with which he moved was simply inconceivable, and the fact that he could control this massive flaming phoenix took all his friends by surprise. But the one who was the most shocked was the bull. Seeing how Hui Yue had become a blue flaming phoenix and was descending upon him caused his heart to swell with pride. It caused him to remember the appearance of a red phoenix thousands of years ago before when his master had displayed the might of the phoenix descent to him. except this time it was even more powerful that the one he had seen.</p><p dir="ltr">The blue flames left in their wake sheer destruction. Not only was the ground shattering, and all the stones melting, scars appeared on the surface of the earth. The sheer power and destruction this attack caused everyone to turn speechless. This attack was so outstanding, so awe-inspiring that no one knew what they were supposed to say. Everyone could only stare at Hui Yue with their mouths agape and their eyes wide open. This attack he had comprehended was way above the Saint level. Hui Yue had proven once again that he was the strongest amongst them all; he was truly a supreme expert amongst experts.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even the bull could only laugh at himself for having thought that Hui Yue was not able to comprehend this ability. Now that he saw that the blue flamed Phoenix Descent almost collapsed the entire world they were within, his eyes were sparkling with excitement.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Well done!&#x201D; He could not help but praise before he nodded his head as the world around them twisted and turned. The wasteland they had been within for months vanished in one go, and suddenly they found themselves in what seemed to be a desolate mountain range. All around them mountain peaks could be seen. These mountains ascended into the sky so high that clouds covered them and no one could see the top.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They were standing in what seemed to be a valley between the mountains. Here they suddenly saw a number of shadows appear in front of them. These shadows that appeared slowly took the shape of humans, but they did not stop there. Their shape kept changing until all of them had the shape of the group of experts which had entered.</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;This is the Trial of Teamwork!&#x201D; The bull began, but he quickly quieted down again. Looking behind him, he found that Hui Yue had collapsed after using such a strong ability. All his energy had been used up, and he needed to restore this energy before he was able to continue the trials ahead of them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It only took Hui Yue a good three hours before he awoke, and as he did, his eyes were filled with astonishment as he looked at their new destination. He had collapsed the moment he had used the Phoenix Descent and did not even notice their change in location.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Hui Yue&apos;s astonished expression, the bull cleared his throat. &#x201C;This is the Trial of Teamwork. This trial is simple. You need to defeat yourselves. Although this trial might seem easy, it is not as easy as you might think because as you improve so will your copies. As you gain strength so will they. The only thing that they will not gain is the ability to work together. They will have your current abilities of teamwork but this will not evolve any further.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Once again, there is no time limit. All that I need is for you to defeat your copies! Now enjoy the fight!&#x201D; The bull said, and just as before he had expected these young people would instantly unleash their strongest attacks and attack their copies; however, none of them moved at first.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, they formed a group where they sat down and started talking to one another.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;We cannot just attack. This is a test of teamwork, not a test of strength. To defeat them obviously takes us working together. Our current teamwork is not the best, so let&#x2019;s take this opportunity to learn just how well we work together.&#x201D; Hui Yue said, and the others nodded their heads, all of them excited.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing their behavior, the bull was surprised, but he nodded his head in acknowledgment. It was indeed a good decision not to rush into this battle. Although they had strong attacks, this was not the only thing that mattered. The copies had strong attacks as well, and if they met face on they were likely to end up wounded. Knowing this, Hui Yue had stopped them and now they were all thinking up different plans and tactics while their shadow copies were patiently waiting for their first challenge.</p><br></div><p></p>
