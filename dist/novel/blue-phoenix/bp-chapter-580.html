He had never before heard about descendants of the great roc who possessed more than one bloodline, as a matter of fact, he had heard that it was impossible to have multiple bloodlines. Some time ago a few elders from the Celestial Sword Sect had tried to make it appear for more than a millennia, but they eventually gave up the idea.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet here, right in front of his very eyes, was Hui Yue. Hui Yue was clearly displaying two kinds of bloodlines, and although he had never seen the wolf bloodline amongst the great sects, this was astonishing news! Even so, Hui Yue just grinned.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t take me too lightly,&quot; he said seriously as he pounced at Wei with lifted hands, his claws in a position to strike.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue had no intentions of actually wounding Wei, he understood that if he wished to fully test himself, he had to go all out. A roar escaped his lips that made the entire room reverberate as he lashed out at the guard. His arms swiped down as the gravity around them suddenly increased tenfold making it difficult for Wei to avoid his attack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Not bad!&quot; Wei praised through gritted teeth as his Ancestral Worldpower flowed out and once more formed a barrier around him. The impact caused sparks to fly everywhere as Hui Yue&#x2019;s sharp claws came into contact with it. The sound of an explosion boomed as both Hui Yue and Wei were shot backward and landed heavily against the walls of the room.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hissing in pain, Hui Yue slowly stood back up. Although it was as hard to break Hui Yue&apos;s defense as it was to break a mountain, he still felt pain and almost coughed up blood from the impact.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Wei was not much better off as his defense was equal to Hui Yue&apos;s. Not because of him having a defense like a mountain but because he was an Immortal of Creation, but even so he too felt pain from the impact and being slammed hard against the wall of the room.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire room trembled and the wall had cracks spreading on it. Hui Yue and Wei were both stunned as they saw this and looked at each other rather ashamed about the fact that they had broken the chamber. They had never expected that the meditation room, which seemed to be able to contain the many different daos they used, could not control the impact from their fight and thus they had no other choice other than to stop their match before they completely destroyed the room.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Seems like we should stop,&quot; Wei said with a wry smile on his face as he started touching his back making sure that his clothes had not broken in the clash just now. Hui Yue, who also understood that they could not continue their fight in the room, slowly returned to his human shape and wrapped a new cloak around himself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although we had to stop, I feel like I got something out of it anyway,&quot; he said honestly while flashing a grin at the guard by his side.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You have plenty of tricks, that is for sure,&quot; Wei agreed with a pained expression on his face. It had been a very long time since he last felt pain and just now the pain from being slammed into the wall of the meditation room lingered in his body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are quite strong; your dao of gravity is amazing at restraining the enemy, and your wolf form increases your strength tremendously. Although there is still a gap between you and a peak Primordial Immortal if we are only gauging the strength you have already displayed. I am sure you have even more hidden techniques you haven&apos;t used, and even I will am unable to say if you will last.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pausing for a moment, Wei scratched his head in embarrassment and smiled slightly, &quot;I do hope you win,&quot; he finally said. &quot;I think you will be a good judge and I would be quite proud to say that I know you personally.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If you do become a judge then I will ask to be placed in your service,&quot; he said seriously, and Hui Yue felt warm at heart when he heard his words. &quot;Thank you; it means a lot to me.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Wei was there to be his guard, Hui Yue saw him more like a friend than anything else.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the two of them sat down and started discussing the short sparring match they just had a knock was suddenly heard on the door. When they opened it, a timid young woman was standing outside.</p><p dir="ltr">She dared not look at either Hui Yue or Wei as she fidgeted around with her hands. Finally, after a few seconds, she opened her mouth to talk, but stuttered, &quot;Myy my lord, Kking Yanluo has ordered to move you to another room tthat has a meditation room that isn&#x2019;t cracking.&quot; Pausing and twisting her hands, she continued after a bit, &quot;He also said that you should not destroy any more rooms for now and that he believes in you.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The more she spoke, the lower her voice became and at the end both Hui Yue and Wei had to lean forward to be able to catch the words that escaped her lips.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue and Wei straightened their backs, and both looked rather embarrassed as they remembered that they were here as guests, yet even so, they had destroyed a meditation room and disturbed Yanluo. Both of them sheepishly scratched the back of their heads as they realized this.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are very sorry,&quot; Hui Yue said with a slight smile on his face before he gestured for Wei to follow behind him. The two were ready to leave yet when they tried to do so, the woman just stayed where she was. Her head was bowed and her hands were still fidgeting in front of her.</p><p dir="ltr">They stood like this for some time before Hui Yue cleared his throat. &quot;Um... We should get going,&quot; he said with a friendly smile on his face causing the girl to jump at the sound of his voice, and like a frightened mouse, she turned to leave the room and lead them to a room a few doors down.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This will be your new room. Please enjoy your stay here in the Second Court of Hell!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having said this, she pushed open the door and then turned straight away and quickly fled.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Stunned Hui Yue and Wei looked at one another before they both started chuckling. The poor demon girl had been so frightened that she had no courage to even look at them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking their heads, both Hui Yue and Wei entered the room and looked around. It was similar to the room they had had before, and there was also an adjoined room here for Wei.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Settling in, they quickly closed the door and found a pair of chairs where they continued their discussion about the fight. They talked about how Hui Yue could improve and the things he should not do.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was calming speaking with someone about fighting, and both Hui Yue and Wei were so engrossed in their conversation that they forgot the embarrassing fact that they had broken a meditation room.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is such a shame that we are stuck here in these rooms,&quot; Hui Yue finally sighed as he looked out the windows. &quot;I am sure that this palace has plenty of rooms where we can practice our skills and spar with one another, but we are not allowed to leave the room. And we have to stay here for two weeks with no real way to train our fighting skills.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was usually not one to complain, but this tournament was incredibly important to him. He could not help but feel that it was a waste that he could not spar more with his guard, but Wei just shook his head, &quot;It might work for you, but the others do not have anyone to spar against.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Everyone here, except yourself and the two others from the two major clans, will end up in Diyu. If we beat them by mistake, we will suffer later in our career. Considering all of us guards are Immortals of Creation, it is almost impossible for us to lose therefore it is not something people would volunteer to do.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;How petty,&quot; Hui Yue sighed. &quot;It should be an honor to fight with the guards, and it is natural that we will get beaten considering you are all stronger than us. Just because of such a reason, we should not make it hard on you in the future.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The two men both sighed and sat there in silence for a short while before Hui Yue&apos;s eyes gleamed. &quot;It will be quite some time before the experts gather for the tournament, so I better spend the time improving myself.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Should I focus on increasing my Ancestral Worldpower pool, or should I start comprehending another dao?&quot; Hui Yue was unsure for some time but Wei shook his head, &quot;You already know quite a few daos and getting another dao is never a bad idea, but in your case, it might not be a great help considering all the daos you have comprehended are split between the major daos. You are no closer right now to comprehending a major dao than anyone who has comprehended one dao alone.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But even so, having an extra dao is always a lifesaver. I would not be against you comprehending another dao. Of course, you will not be able to fully comprehend it in a short while, but you should still be able to gain some insights you could use while fighting.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;On the other hand, accumulating Ancestral Worldpower is always a good idea since it allows for you to grow stronger. Every attack is filled with more force the more Ancestral Worldpower you have, and you can fight for longer periods of time the more you have. However, this is also a sticky situation since you have the dao of devouring. You can just absorb the energy in the air around you and directly turn it into your own energy, not to mention that you are capable of stealing the energy of your opponent.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;So, what I mean to say is that it does not really matter which one you pick. Both have benefits so either way, you will increase your strength.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But keep in mind that there is not really a lot that will happen. You are a God now, the amount of time you have until the tournament starts is too short; you will not gain much during this time.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Why don&apos;t I tell you a secret,&quot; Hui Yue suddenly said with a grin on his face as he looked into the air in front of him. &quot;You know, I was born as a mortal and had to train every day assiduously to increase my strength. I am now a Primordial Immortal, and not a new God anymore so how old do you think I am?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing the question Wei was taken aback for a moment, but he furrowed his brows after some time and looked at Hui Yue. &quot;You were born a mortal? But your father is Pei Tian? So your mother was mortal?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue just nodded his head, not going into details about it, but Wei seemed surprised to hear this. &quot;Shocking!&quot; He said, but then he shook his head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your talent is immeasurable, and you broke the assessment orb which means that your cultivation speed should be quite outstanding.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I guess you are just shy of two hundred and fifty years old? I mean you are a part of the younger generation so you cannot be much older than that.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Hui Yue laughed before shaking his head. He raised one hand and displayed all five fingers, &quot;I am not even fifty years old yet!&quot; He exclaimed, and his words caused Wei&apos;s already wide eyes to turn much bigger, and he stuttered in surprise, &quot;Fifty years since you became a God?!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue shook his head, &quot;Not even fifty years since I was born.&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
