For this expert to do this, though, they would need to have a treasure similar to the Universe Box, something many experts wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors said that a newly Crowned Sovereign had appeared which had taken the world away with him. However, the rumors about this new Crowned Sovereign were simply outrageous and hard to believe, and the patriarch of the Celestial Sword Sect and Pei Tian did their best to further perpetuate these rumors.</p><p dir="ltr">Some said that the Crowned Sovereign was, as a matter of fact, an expert who had lived for eons and taken a liking to the world after which he took it away with him.</p><p dir="ltr">Other rumors said that it was actually the Alchemist God himself who had reemerged and taken over the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Some thought it was an Asura; a bloodthirsty killer who was roaming the galaxy and needed a world full of mortals he could slaughter for his dao.</p><p dir="ltr">The rumors floated around everywhere and they became more and more outrageous, but the patriarch and Pei Tian managed to succeed in hiding the truth about Hui Yue being the new Crowned Sovereign of the Divine Beast World.</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue was cultivating, his communication orb turned warm. Looking at it, he saw the face of Pei Tian and his expression was rather worried as he looked at Hui Yue with tenderness.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have some information for you,&quot; he said with a sigh. Originally he would have preferred not to tell this child about it, but in the end, he had no other option than to tell the truth to keep him safe.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We did some investigations about you and noticed that the Divine Beast World is now gone from its position in the galaxy. We were told that it recently got a new Crowned Sovereign before it vanished and it is easy to guess that this new sovereign is you,&quot; Pei Tian said straightforwardly, and his words caused Hui Yue to freeze. &quot;We are aware that to move away a world you need something similar to the legendary Universe Box, and we are not the only ones who have reached this conclusion,&quot; Pei Tian sighed. &quot;Although many rumors about the new Crowned Sovereign have started to spread, some people will be able to find the truth, so I suggest you be very careful for the next many years,&quot; he said with great care and consideration in his voice. &quot;Use the name Pei Yue when you travel outside. It will tell people that you are a member of the Celestial Sword Sect, and don&apos;t mention to anyone that you come from the Divine Beast World.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Right now only you, the ancestors, and the patriarch know about this as the fewer who know, the better it will be. Although you will be known as the bastard of the Celestial Sword Sect, that will be many times better than being known as the Crowned Sovereign of the Divine Beast World with your current level of strength.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear to Hui Yue that this elder truly cared about him, and this caused him to feel warm at heart. Although he had not merged with the memories of his previous life just yet, he was certain that this man was his father a lifetime ago. Even though he could not acknowledge it, Hui Yue still decided to do anything he could to make life easier for this elderly man.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I thank ancestor for having made me aware of the situation,&quot; Hui Yue said with deeply felt gratitude. He had never before expected that removing the Divine Beast World would cause such a commotion.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t stand on ceremony with me young one,&quot; the ancestor instantly said with a smile on his face. &quot;Refer to me as uncle. You are after all of the third generation, if I am not your father, I will at least be your uncle.&quot; The ancestor said with a voice filled with affection. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thank you for your warnings, Uncle,&quot; Hui Yue repeated saying uncle this time. He too had some gentle feelings for this older man. Although he had not merged with the memories of the wings just yet, he had already started to understand some of his emotions, and the emotions he felt towards his father was clearly affection.</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding his head, the ancestor felt a knot in his stomach untighten as he saw the affection in Hui Yue&apos;s eyes. Nodding his head, the communication orb once more filled with mist as the figure vanished.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Seems like I better not use my real name for some time,&quot; Hui Yue said out loud, and Huli, who was right behind him, nodded her head. She placed her arms around his shoulders and gave him a hug from behind.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your decision to take the world with you was the right one. Had you not done so, then An He would have likely returned and destroyed it. That or any number of cultivators would cause problems for the world when they realized that its rank on the heavenly ranking started to rise drastically. This way, now that it has gone missing, everyone will be thinking about the Crowned Sovereign, but no one will be able to tie it to a new member of the Celestial Sword Sect. Make sure you never use the name Hui Yue until you are strong enough to protect yourself.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The only one who knows your name is An He, and right now I think he is very busy with something since he did not have the time to fight you when you became a God. So I think you should not worry too much about your name being leaked. Spend this time of silence to strengthen yourself in the trials and then afterwards at the Celestial Sword Sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although you are going to be considered the bastard of the Celestial Sword Sect, you are so talented that the sect won&apos;t care too much about this, and considering you are a third generation disciple you should get quite a bit of cultivation resources.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Roaming through her storage stone bracelet, Huli finally withdrew a large jade bottle and opened it. Inside was a sea of pills, and she took one of them out and handed it to Hui Yue. Handing the pill over a smile adorned her face, and she looked very proud of herself.</p><p dir="ltr">This pill was one that Hui Yue had seen before. The pill was none other than the Pill of Clarity; a pill which allowed for one to focus on a specific dao and increase one&apos;s ability to comprehend the dao for a certain amount of time.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This pill is one I know you recognize. This entire bottle is filled with these pills made by the Alchemist God, and although I already sold one, I have plenty left.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Even the Celestial Sword Sect cannot afford to feed you Pills of Clarity the way I can. Right now the most important thing is that you need to finish comprehending the dao of the sword, and thus you should use this pill to finish in&#xA0;it in one go.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who had been with Huli for a long time, did not say anything unnecessary. He just accepted the pill and gave Huli a gentle kiss on her forehead before he jumped on the bed. He sat down with his legs crossed and closed his eyes as he placed the pill in his mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">Huli, who had not expected anything else, just smiled as she saw the unconcealed happiness on Hui Yue&apos;s face. She knew that comprehending the entire dao of the sword would not be difficult. It was only a question of time before finished it, and with the help of the Pill of Clarity, he could comprehend it at a much faster speed.</p><p dir="ltr">Seated on the bed, the aura around Hui Yue&apos;s body sharpened. It became much like a real sword as he sat there. This aura around him formed a sword made from white mist.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One beam of swordlight after another erupted from Hui Yue&apos;s body and exploded forth with incredible speed and destructive power. If Huli were not blocking every single one of them, then the entire room would have been destroyed countless times over already.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Every time someone came to the room, either members of the Celestial Sword Sect or servants wishing to provide food for the young master, they were all turned away by Huli.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This continued for a full seven days before Pei Ze was the one who arrived, and although Huli wished to block him, she also knew that he was most likely here because of something important, so she allowed him to enter.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yue is currently training,&quot; Huli said as she reached out her hand and blocked another wayward swordlight from slamming into the wall and drilling a hole through it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the way Hui Yue and Huli were training, Pei Ze was surprised. He could feel that currently Hui Yue was comprehending the dao rapidly and the surrounding atmosphere was roiling and churning as the dao filled the air within the room as Hui Yue comprehended the mysteries behind it.</p><p dir="ltr">The speed with which he was comprehending the dao was so swift that Pei Ze was turning pale as he watched this scene.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at the pale expert, Huli chuckled slightly before she shook her head. &quot;The reason I have declined everyone&apos;s attempt to contact Yue is because he is under the influence of a Pill of Clarity,&quot; she said honestly, and although Pei Ze had the impression that he was under the effect of some pill he never believed it would be such a rare pill.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The formula for the Pill of Clarity originated from the Alchemist God, but it had long since been leaked to everyone else. Although the formula was widely known, one needed to incredibly skilled in the dao of alchemy to produce a Pill of Clarity, and even the master alchemists at the Celestial Sword Sect had difficulty creating such a pill. From this, one could see just how rare these pills were.</p><p dir="ltr">The fact that Hui Yue had taken one to comprehend the dao of the sword, a dao which was simply too common, shocked Pei Ze almost as much as it had when he had displayed his third generation wings.</p><p dir="ltr">Huli, seeing the shocked expression on Pei Ze&apos;s face mused for a moment before she waved her hand and a small round pill appeared in her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Take this one and keep it a secret,&quot; she said seriously as she handed a Pill of Clarity to Pei Ze who accepted it with both hands. Although Huli was the beast companion of Hui Yue, Pei Ze had the impression that she was just as mysterious as her master.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Wait...&quot; Pei Ze said stunned as he looked at the pill in his hand. &quot;This is the mark of the Alchemist God!&quot; He exclaimed completely shocked. It was one thing to obtain a Pill of Clarity, but to get a Pill of Clarity concocted by the Alchemist God was simply too outstanding. These pills were so hard to come by that it was almost impossible to buy them for money.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What is your relationship with the Alchemist God?&quot; Pei Ze asked curiously, but Huli just looked at him with her calm and casual eyes. &quot;I cannot tell you unless Yue wants you to know. For now, we should just wait for him to finish comprehending the dao of the sword. Considering the strength he is showing right now when he is releasing swordlight; he is incredibly close.&quot; Huli finally said and Pei Ze, who did not wish to make enemies with this beast companion, just nodded his head. He made a mental note to make sure to ask Hui Yue later about what exactly their relationship with the Alchemist God was.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
