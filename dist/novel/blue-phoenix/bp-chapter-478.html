This time they did not request for any proof. Hearing Hui Yue say that it was the case was already enough for them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Now that we have that out of the way let&#x2019;s take care of the Dungeons of the Divine.&quot; Hui Yue said with a brilliant smile on his face as though what he had said was something as simple as telling them his name.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gods all felt as though they had fallen from the sky and landed in a world they had never heard of before. Their new master, the person who seemed so weak, actually had so many hidden trump cards that caused even them, who had been Gods for thousands of years, to feel a headache. They had no urge to fight him as they now understood that although the amount of Ancestral Worldpower he had was below theirs, his strength might not be that far behind.</p><p dir="ltr">The first person to pull himself together was the bull. He had already seen many of the miracles this young man had shown, and it made sense that he had some strength that others could not see.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;So what is our plan?&quot; The bull asked curiously, and although the other Gods were all still deeply shocked, they quickly regained their composure. They were exalted beings and although they were deeply shocked, they did not allow for this shock to stun them. If they were easily stunned, they would not have been able to live as long a life as they had.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was not only the Gods but all of Hui Yue&apos;s friends that also turned to look at Hui Yue. They were just as curious about what they were going to do, but all they saw was a carefree grin on his face. With a shrug of his shoulders, he said. &quot;It&apos;s simple, we go and wreak havoc. We kill anyone from the beast corps we see and release any of the Laws that we come across. We destroy the ceiling of the first cave and let everyone see that there is a world above.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t kill the civilian unless they go against us but don&apos;t allow for any of the corps&#x2019; members to go free.&quot; Hui Yue repeated the order and together with the others, he moved towards the stairs. Without hesitating even for a moment, he moved down into the darkness below.</p><p dir="ltr">When Deng Wu and the others moved through this set of stairs before there had been torches on both sides of the stairs illuminating the path but now there was nothing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Frowning Hui Yue lifted his hand and a bright ball of fire appeared in his palm. The ball of fire lit up everything around them so that they could easily see their surroundings.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was quiet as he looked at the stairs in front of him. His nose vibrated slightly, and his eyes turned dark as he noticed that the stairs they were walking down had dried blood smeared all over them. They could smell the stench of rotten flesh and metallic blood.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Something is wrong.&quot; He said, but it was unnecessary for him to speak as everyone had guessed that something had happened.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The further down the stairs they went the worse the stench became. Soon they also saw some of the corpses which had caused the terrible smell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These bodies all seemed as though some terrifying beast had appeared and rippled them to shreds. Some had their heads almost severed while others had their bodies sliced in four pieces slashed by massive claws.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Every corpse wore or had the marks of the Dragon Corps present, and Hui Yue could not help but wonder what could have happened. How come the experts above ground did not seem to know what had happened down here. It was at least a few months since this had happened, considering the state of these corpses.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone covered their mouth and nose with clothes as they sped through this area rushing to the bottom of the stairs. The further down they went the more death they encountered.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They moved at the fastest speed possible that allowed the Saints and Emperors to follow them and thus the trip was actually rather short. However, to them, it felt as though it had taken an eternity. By the time they reached the end, Jo ended up vomiting on the floor. Her face was pale and sweat was pouring from her face and body.</p><p dir="ltr">She was not the only one looking sick, Wang Ju Long and Sha Yun were also incredibly pale. Surprisingly, even the necromancer, Deng Wu, was uncomfortable with the situation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the stairs was large cast iron door which had been closed. It was so heavy that one needed immense strength to break through it. Although it would bring some trouble to the Emperors and Saints, it was not even a challenge to a God ranked cultivator. When Hui Yue lifted his hand and pushed the door open, it burst into pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">No one knew what to expect when they entered the Dungeons of the Divine, but none of them expected what they found.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The mansion which belonged to the Dragon Corps had been completely trashed. There were signs that many pyres had been lit signifying that someone had been cleaning up after many deaths. People were moving through the rubble, all of whom looked sick, but nonetheless, they were working. The air within this world was polluted, and the smell of death permeated it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What happened here?&quot; Hui Yue asked as he went to one of the first men he saw. He had nothing to fear from this place and thus he was not on guard.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at Hui Yue, confusion was evident in his eyes. The man he spoke to cleared his throat. &quot;Are you from one of our sister dungeon systems?&quot; He asked curiously. &quot;I thought everyone knew that this Dragon dungeon system had been contaminated with disease and only a few have been allowed to migrate to the other systems.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are indeed from one of the other dungeons.&quot; Hui Yue said seriously as he nodded his head. &quot;We came to investigate the cause for so many people suddenly wishing to join our tunnel system.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see.&quot; The man nodded his head as though the explanation made sense, and Hui Yue could not help but see that the others were grinning behind him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, it is simple. Three months ago an expert appeared. He was flying in the sky over the capital and called for all the Dragon Corps members to appear. After he arrived, the majority of the corps were forced to leave. No one knows where they went, but because of that there were less than half of the force left.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Then one night this person reappeared and called for the rest of the Dragon Corps to appear. He laid waste to the entire Dragon Corps headquarters and killed any guard that appeared in front of him. When he had killed them all, he suddenly vanished.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We cleaned up the dead, but because so many people died, it was hard to avoid having the majority of our city become sick. We are trying to ensure that none other of the caves become infected, but it is hard.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head and turned to leave. He saw that there was hope in the man&apos;s face. Hope for survival. Hui Yue spoke no more with the man, but both he and his friends had heard the words spoken by this man, and they all knew what had happened.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Considering that they are fleeing to other caves, this cave should be the the only one where they have been punished.&quot; Hui Yue mused but then he shrugged.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We don&apos;t have to kill anyone here.&quot; He said casually as he looked into the sky. &quot;Tear down the roof!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">As his words rang out, Ancestral Worldpower erupted from Hui Yue&apos;s body and blasted into the ground above. A beam of red energy poured from Hui Yue&apos;s body illuminating the entire underground cave. The energy burned the air, making it much fresher and seemingly absorbing the aura of death.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as this energy touched the ceiling above ground, there was a struggle. The entire cave started trembling, and fine dust started to fall to the ground like gently falling snow. No massive stones fell, nor did the cave show any signs of collapsing, but the formation which kept the ceiling from being able to be dug through was slowly being eroded by Hui Yue&apos;s Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p dir="ltr">The formation was as old as the Dungeons of the Divine themselves, and it had never been created as a formation that would last for eternity. Because of this, Hui Yue was quickly able to overcome it.</p><p dir="ltr">The moon and the sun which had hung in the sky of the cave, in the formation on the roof, slowly dimmed as the formation was destroyed. It was clear that it was no longer possible to keep illuminating this world if the formation was gone.</p><p dir="ltr">Terror! Pure terror! Everyone felt horrified as they saw the sun and moon fading. They knew that were it not for these two phenomena then they would live in a world of darkness, and now some unknown person was trying to get rid of their only source of light.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of these citizens who were in a frenzy jumped towards Hui Yue, but around him was a circle of extreme experts. Anyone who went for him was pushed backwards. The lucky were just knocked unconscious; the unlucky died on the spot. The Gods were simply not able to control their sheer power.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s Ancestral Worldpower dug into the ground and slowly managed to turn the stone into nothing but fine dust that kept falling to the floor. Soon a gust of wind entered the cave, and the look of the citizens became stunned. The moon and the sun had completely vanished, but from above, from this big hole in the ceiling, the humans saw light! They saw a soft light slowly descending through the roof, and even more, they felt the fresh breeze which brought with it a scent of rain and nature.</p><p dir="ltr">It was not that these citizens had never experienced rain or the wind before. However, the wind they were used to was stifled as the air they had beneath ground was much denser. The rain they had was lukewarm, and it was never really cold, but here was a sharp cold wind bringing with its freshness and a promise of a new life.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had used a bit of his Ancestral Worldpower to erode this piece of the earth, but he was far from his limit as he pushed out more power, the hole expanded. Soon his constantly expanding red Ancestral Worldpower filled the sky of the entire capital. With its expansion more and more dust fell to the ground. More and more of the sky and outside world were revealed to these people in the dungeon. At this moment they felt like turtles in a well! Only now did they realize that the world was simply vast beyond measure!</p><p dir="ltr">The man whom Hui Yue had asked for information had stayed close to Hui Yue this entire time, and at some point, he had felt hopelessness. He had not joined the frenzied citizens in attacking because he felt there was no point, but now, for the first time in three months, he felt excitement. He felt as though he had been given another lease on life, and he fell to his knees. He was kowtowing on the ground with tears streaming from his eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">All over the city, the same display happened over and over again. One person after another sank to their knees, kowtowing to the strange thing that was happening in the sky. They all knew that a God had descended from the heavens to bring them out of their misery!</p><br></div><p></p>
