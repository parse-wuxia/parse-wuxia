Knowing this, they were quite nervous, but Hui Yue just smiled at them.</p><p>&quot;We will kill our foes as fast as we can and take the pressure from you all,&quot; he promised, as he felt his heart racing from anticipation.</p><p>He was sure that this would be a great battle no matter who emerged victorious in the end.</p><p>&quot;Who would have thought that they took you so seriously,&quot; Hu Yong said with his rough voice and massive body.</p><p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jia Na asked, and Hu Yong smiled just shaking his head.</p><p>&quot;All of them are proud sons of the heavens who have killed humans time and time again. They are arrogant and believe in their own ability above all else, but even so, they have been forced to flock together to deal with our dear Yue.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This must be a great loss of face for them,&quot; Wan Qiao agreed with a nod of her head.</p><p>&quot;They seem to have not brought the rest of their minions though,&quot; Lao said rather observantly. &quot;They must have thought it would be too much of a shame if they had their followers seeing them working together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It could also be that they know bringing them here would just mean their death,&quot; Jo said ruthlessly. Her eyes gleamed with a sinister light, and a vicious smile was on her lips. She was ready to attack.</p><p>Wang Ju Long said nothing. She stood next to Huli and Sha Yun, and the three of them looked lovingly at Hui Yue.</p><p>Huli had gained great insight into the dao of darkness, allowing her to fully control both the dao of Wind and the dao of darkness.</p><p>Huli&#x2019;s strength had soared greatly, and so far the only one who had not comprehended a major dao was Wang Ju Long. She was still comprehending the major dao of darkness, but it took longer than normal because she was at the same time also gaining insights into the heavenly dao of death.</p><p>Tang Tian, Hu Yong, Shen Wei, Lu Jing, Jia Na, Yan Lei, Zhong Li, Mu Haolong, Wan Qiao, Lan Feng, and Da Hu all slowly allowed for their bodies to expand. They started transforming and taking on their beastly forms.</p><p>Tang Tian was a flood dragon; Hu Yong was a giant rhinoceros. Shen Wei was a jackal; Lu Jing was a three-headed dog. Jia Na was a sea serpent, a long snake-like existence. Yan Lei was a turtle, not of the same heritage as the Black Turtle one of the four divine beasts, but another less magnificent turtle race. Zhong Li was a qilin, a mythical and very rare creature that was as rare as a phoenix, and Mu Haolong took on the massive shape of a bull that would trample the earth and fear no one. Da Hu was a white tiger, and Lan Feng was a blue phoenix.</p><p>All these beasts were quite massive, and they took up a lot of space. Seeing all the beasts transform before the fight showed just how serious they were about this upcoming battle.</p><p>The Blood Demons and humans had the disadvantage that their bodies were smaller than the beasts&apos; and thus they did not command as much strength as their race.</p><p>By fully using their strength alongside the fact that most of the beast Gods also commanded two major daos meant that they would be able to bridge at least some of the differences in strength between them and the supreme experts from the Blood Demon&#x2019;s side.</p><p>A nervousness hung in the air, but Hui Yue had faith in his friends and their ability to manage. He said nothing, just smiled faintly.</p><p>&quot;Human, you dare challenge all of us? Face death!&quot; one of the demons called as soon as they were within range to be heard, and Hui Yue could not help but sigh.</p><p>He did not know who was who concerning these experts. He just knew the aliases that the humans had given them and their preferred way of killing.</p><p>&quot;You have brought a whole menagerie with you,&quot; said another Blood Demon full of derision as he looked at the beasts behind Hui Yue, but he was completely ignored.</p><p>Instead, his eyes narrowed as he caught sight of a young Blood Demon. He had the appearance of a child, but the atmosphere around him was truly bizarre. It was as if even the other demons were wary of this cultivator.</p><p>&quot;Seems like I really cannot afford to underestimate these Blood Demons,&quot; Hui Yue muttered to himself, and as he looked at this young boy, the boy also looked back at Hui Yue.</p><p>The moment their eyes met, Hui Yue felt a shiver run down his spine. This was without a doubt the most formidable foe he had ever had to fight.</p><p>The eyes of the child also rose slightly after meeting his, but there was an arrogance, a certainty, in his eyes like he felt no threat at all from Hui Yue just curiosity.</p><p>Hui Yue sighed. &quot;It is better to be underestimated,&quot; Lan Feng said on his side as his feathered wing patted Hui Yue on the head. The scene was rather comical, and the demons who were unable to hear what he said were filled with confusion. What exactly were they doing?</p><p>Being reassured, Hui Yue felt better. He was feeling much more confident, and he also realized that if he truly couldn&apos;t kill them, then he and all his friends would die.</p><p>&quot;Should I help him?&quot; while Hui Yue had steeled himself and reached a higher mental state; the elder was pondering indecisively. His face was filled with confusion, and he paced back and forth while wrapping space around him so that no one noticed that he was present.</p><p>&quot;I wanted him to struggle and perform a great deed for humanity at the same time. At first, I had thought he was arrogant like any other genius and would have declined these three tasks, but I guess for the sake of his friends, he accepted the trials.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I figured that he would not even pass the first trial, but now that I have given him a second one, I assumed that he would be able to pass it. It was only ten experts in one year, but who would have thought that his means were so ruthless. Not just ruthless to others, but also incredibly ruthless towards himself!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I never expected him to fight them at the same time; this is simply suicide! Does he have some tricks up his sleeve, or does he have some power that I still do not know of? He seems so calm, but he is still very young.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If he dies because of a trial I gave him then his old man is going to be very unreasonable. I fear that my entire family will be eradicated&#x2026; I ought to help him, but if I do, then I will lose any face I had. I came for vengeance but ended up saving my enemy. If my friends ever hear about this, I will be the joke of the century.&quot;</p><p>He sighed. &quot;I will wait for now and see what happens. If he can handle them on his own, then that is good, but if he cannot then, I will lend him a hand.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue, now being completely safe from danger, was unaware of this man wanting to do the best for him, and thus he reached out to his core and found every single open cave.</p><p>He activated the drop of blood, the shining star, and all the open caves. He felt how the blue cloud and red mist started billowing out from his body laying themselves like a blanket over him. They were enhancing one another and carried with it the dao of devouring.</p><p>This concept, the dao of devouring, was one of the daos that Hui Yue had the most understanding with, and although he knew major daos, this particular dao always assisted him when he was fighting by constantly replenishing his Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p>He had also reached out to the drop of blood which constantly replenished his soulforce.</p><p>The shining star had touched upon the dao of time, and the dao that it belonged under, the major dao of light.</p><p>Hui Yue decided to use the dao of time in various ways. One was to lay a layer of the dao&apos;s essence, around his body and over Sword of the Icy Tempest that he had in his hand. The other way was to spread it out in the blue and red mist changing the time in the area of it causing everything to move slower.</p><p>As long as an attacker was not much stronger than Hui Yue, they would be affected, and many of these experts were weaker. Hence Hui Yue could assist his friends by slowing down their opponents.</p><p>Brandishing his weapon, Hui Yue took a step forward, and the child smiled as he hovered towards the young white-haired man.</p><p>&quot;My lord, let us team up and battle this vile human together!&quot; one of the ten great experts said with indignation in his voice as he looked at Hui Yue with anger in his eyes.</p><p>This human had brazenly challenged every single supreme expert of the Blood Demon&#x2019;s within the western region; it was a great loss of face and also a great insult to the entire demon race.</p><p>&quot;Do you doubt me?&quot; the child asked. His voice was juvenile and without the rust of age. It was high pitched, and one could not tell if the child was a female or male from the voice alone, but this juvenile voice carried with it a power which caused the Blood Demon to scurry away.</p><p>&quot;I deserve death by ten thousand cuts!&quot; he cried out as he bowed deeply. &quot;I do not think that you were incapable, I just do not wish to underestimate this opponent,&quot; he muttered afterwards, and the child smiled as his eyes once more roamed over Hui Yue&apos;s body.</p><p>&quot;I am known as one of the seventy-two blood princes, and am ranked seventy of seventy-two,&quot; the young man introduced himself.</p><p>&quot;My older brother is An He, who ranks eleventh of all the blood princes. He told me I could not give you a quick death. I had to let you suffer, let you experience the might of the blood princes, and teach you what it is like to be born with an innate strength unlike any you weak humans could ever imagine.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue looked at the child and started chuckling slightly. &quot;To think that a kid is trying to teach me the difference between heaven and earth,&quot; he laughed while shaking his head.</p><p>&quot;An He is a simple human who turned his back on humanity in the hopes of gaining more strength. This shows that he does not have what it takes to stand at the apex. He has given up his future accomplishments for instant strength, how disappointing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And you, a kid still wet behind his ears thinks that he is able to teach me something? Let me ask you then, little brat, how much experience do you have actually going outside the palaces? Do you know what it really means to fight in a life and death battle, and even more important, have you had the time to actually gain an understanding of the daos that you control? I assume that you don&apos;t just run around flaunting your strength like you are doing now?&quot;</p><p>Every word was more vicious than the next, and the child, who was enraged by the constant reference to his age, was livid with anger as he realized that Hui Yue did not fear him as he had thought.</p><p>&quot;You are dead!&quot; he yelled as he launched himself into an attack, and all the people behind him followed. Their faces were grim as they knew that they did not hold the upper hand now that their leader was burning with rage and had let go of all reason.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
