Yanluo himself had passed him, and no one was stupid enough to question the King of Hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue did not care about what people thought about him, he was still relieved that he had passed as to him he could have just as easily failed the trial.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t discriminate,&quot; Yanluo chuckled as he could feel the unhappiness within the contestants. &quot;If you stand in front of the mirror and nothing happens, obviously you too will pass the trial, but believe my words, passing the trial this way is magnitudes harder than the way that everyone else has passed it.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Yanluo was clearly aware that the reason Hui Yue had not seen any memories was because his current life was convoluted with his previous lives and the mirror only showed one&#x2019;s sins from this lifetime. It was simply not able to break apart what was from his previous lives and what was due to his current life, and because of this, it had just stayed quiet.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Yanluo had not even considered failing Hui Yue. He was rather biased towards this human who had been resurrected by a phoenix, and for some reason, this carried a lot of weight with the King of Hell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The entire group of contestants were quite surprised when they heard the words spoken by Yanluo. To pass this way was harder than passing normally? How could that be? They saw that Hui Yue had done nothing but stand in front of the mirror and look at his own reflection.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Yanluo had not been too biased, he agreed to allow anyone who could also make the mirror remain unactivated to pass the trial, and this calmed the remaining experts quite a bit.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Those who had already passed the trial all sighed as they wondered if they could have done something differently to cause the mirror to not react to them, while those who had yet to face the mirror&#x2019;s trial all hoped that they were perhaps able to pull the same trick.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, as the trials continued they soon found out that no one else was capable of making the mirror remain blank. Everyone else had to go through all their sins, and many cultivators failed the trial. In the end, only one-fourth of them managed to pass.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the trial came to an end, Hui Yue looked around and was shocked to see that only seventeen people had passed this third trial.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">None of the trials so far had tested the strength of the participants, but even so, to manage to get to this point was no easy task.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will instantly continue to the next trial,&quot; Yanluo called out and picked up a sphere with circles upon circles within it. This was a device which Hui Yue remembered having seen before when he merged with the memories of the celestial wings.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was the sphere which tested the talent of an individual. When one&apos;s talent was being tested, they would try to light up as many rings as they could.</p><p dir="ltr">This trial didn&#x2019;t have the slightest bit of suspense for Hui Yue. His talent might have not been the best when was born in the Divine Beast World, however as time had passed he had merged with the memories of the past lives and this had increased his talent tremendously. Not just once or twice, but he had merged already with four past lives causing his talent to soar to the heavens. If he was not a nine-ringed talent, then he was at least an eight-ringed one of this Hui Yue was sure.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This trial is simple,&quot; Yanluo continued. &quot;To be a new Judge of Hell you need talent. Not just any talent, but enough talent where you are able to grow! You might not be the strongest person right now, but as soon as you become a Judge of Hell, you will have to grow fast and become a top-tier expert. Although we can provide you with resources and the like, talent is important to become a strong expert!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Because of this we only want people with above average talent. Seven rings and above are allowed to stay, below seven rings, and you will have failed this trial.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">What Yanluo said made perfect sense. To be a Judge of Hell one truly did need to have personal strength at some point and to have such strength one needed talent.</p><p dir="ltr">Although he asked for talented individuals, he had also been reasonable. He could have said he only wanted the most talented. Those with a nine-ringed talent, but he had also accepted seven and eight-ringed talents as well. He understood that although talent was needed in the end, it isn&#x2019;t everything. One also needs hard work, and sometimes hard work can make up for one&#x2019;s lack of talent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone&apos;s faces were different. One could see expressions ranging from shock and unhappiness to excitement and relief. This kind of trial was not hard in any way, but it was one where no matter how much one tried, it would be impossible to change the result.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only that, almost everyone already knew exactly what they could expect from this trial as anyone who had been born a God knew their talent from when they were young.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One&#x2019;s talent was one thing which did not change, and since they had been tested as children, they already knew what their outcome would be.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One after another they lined up in front of Yanluo. Some were more eager to stand in line than others, and Hui Yue was around the last half part of the group.</p><p dir="ltr">The first person up was the youth from the Nightcrawler Sect. His face was filled with pride as he laid his hand on top of the sphere and a strong light shone as his Ancestral Worldpower entered the sphere.</p><p dir="ltr">The first five rings lit up almost instantly, shining brilliantly, and they were quickly followed by the sixth, seventh, and eighth rings lighting up as well.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even as the eight ring lit, the light did not stop. With his energy pouring into the ninth ring, it also lit up emitting an intense light.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Not bad, your talent is definitely first class,&quot; Yanluo praised with a nod of his head and a satisfied smile appeared on the youth&apos;s face as he looked at Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His glance did not contain arrogance, but curiosity. It was clear that he wished to see the expression on Hui Yue&apos;s face, and Hui Yue was indeed quite surprised. Not only was this person a nine-ringed talent, but his ninth ring was very clear and bright. To find anyone with better talent than this would almost be impossible.</p><p dir="ltr">The next person stepped up, and rightly enough, he did decently. He was a clear seven-ringed talent, and very close to being an eight-ringed talent. Although this could be considered a great result, next to the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth, it was not that amazing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One cultivator after another stepped forward, and all of them were seven to eight-ringed talents until it was Pei Ze&apos;s turn. Stepping forward, he too managed to light the ninth ring, but it was not as bright as the ring from the youth before. It was clear that although he was a heavenly sent talent, he was not as talented as the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they progressed further and further into the line of experts, the level of talent dropped significantly. There were a few eight-ringed experts, but the majority were seven-ringed, and slowly a few six-ringed experts appeared. Even a five-ringed expert showed up.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as before, as soon as the experts had failed the trial, they were led out of the chamber and left to leave on their own. Yanluo had no interest in others.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, almost at the end, it was Hui Yue&apos;s turn to be tested. The air suddenly turned tense, and everyone held their breath as they observed this expert that had intrigued everyone earlier.</p><p dir="ltr">In all trials so far he had excelled. As for whether or not he would manage to get through this trial as well, everyone was quite curious, and many hoped that he would fail.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was calm as he stepped forward and reached out his hand. He summoned a wisp of Ancestral Worldpower and pushed it into the orb.</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly, something shocking happened. Every single ring lit up instantly, and the rings shone more and more brilliantly in a matter of seconds. Soon they shone so brightly that it was impossible to even keep looking at the rings, and suddenly a cracking sound was heard as the orb split in two. The light rings broke free and grew in size expanding outwards until they filled up the entire room before the energy finally vanished and the rings dissipated into the air.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone was stunned. Their words were stuck in their throats, and their eyes widened in shock. Never before had they seen, or even heard of an orb exploding like this.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">What they didn&apos;t know was the reason it had exploded was not because Hui Yue was born as an amazingly talented individual, but because he had been talented and as the years had gone by he had merged with the memories of his previous lives. He had gained their traits, and their talent had merged with his own. In this way, his own talent had been boosted time and time again until now where it was simply unmeasurable.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Surprising,&quot; Yanluo said, with a voice that sounded as if he was not surprised at all, yet King Qinguang was shocked to his core as he sat there staring at this young man through narrowed eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had not triggered the mirror of retribution, and now he had displayed an unmeasurable talent. If he, King Qianguang, were to chose someone to become a new fellow Judge, he would pick Hui Yue straight away.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He also started to understand that Hui Yue was a special individual and a smile appeared on his face. Diyu was the strongest faction within the entire galaxy, but unlike the sects and families, they did not have leaders born to become the Judges of Hell, they had to scout talents instead.</p><p dir="ltr">To strengthen their own position they needed someone talented, and Hui Yue seemed to be just what they were looking for. Right now he was weak, but given the resources and time to train, he would become the most outstanding judge, and King Qinguang was excited just thinking about the unlimited possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Sneaking a glance at Yanluo, he noticed that a knowing smile had appeared on his lips and he nodded his head, &quot;I assume no one questions this young man&apos;s talent and ability to continue the trial,&quot; he said before he waved his hand summoning another orb.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that he had prepared more than just one orb which was rather unusual as most sects only had one. Their orbs were ancient as they never broke. Even if Diyu did have more of them, why would Yanluo have bothered to bring two with him?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was not before now that the others started to understand that Yanluo had already expected the orb to break and realizing this their skulls turned numb, and their bodies shivered in fear.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They were also worried about Hui Yue. To have such talent, his ability must be simply unfathomable, and it was obvious he would become a truly supreme expert in the future. It was important that they curry favor with him, but how should they go about it?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While most were busy considering this, the youth from the Nightcrawler Sect&#x2019;s fighting spirit soared. This was someone from the younger generation, and he was a true opponent! Were it not for the fact that Hui Yue was still here, then the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth would not be here either.</p><br></div><p></p>
