Instead, he headed towards the city and bought what he would need for his journey.</p><p>Hui Yue had pretty much anything he could ever need within the Universe Box. He had a whole world in there and was able to access a constant supply of food and drinks. He also had mountains of medicinal herbs, rare ores, and useful materials.</p><p>He truly did not need anything at all, but to ensure that nothing happened on the trip, he decided to buy a few extra necessities such as the most mediocre medicinal herbs.</p><p>Although he had mountains of herbs, most of those were incredibly rare, and the most used herbs had already been used up. If he wished to continue making pills, then he needed to get his hands on even more of these basic herbs that most pills required.</p><p>His friends spread throughout the entire city and purchased all the basic herbs available. It took them a full hour before all of them met up again, and as they met up, all the herbs they had bought were handed to Hui Yue in storage stones.</p><p>These storage stones were absorbed by the Universe Box while all their contents were placed within the vast space in the Universe Box.</p><p>&quot;Well then, let&#x2019;s go get our hands on one of those bracelets that counts contribution points,&quot; Hui Yue said with a sigh. So far they had not bothered with those bracelets or contribution points, but he had to prove every kill and to do that he had to use the famous bracelet.</p><p>They all headed towards the Gate of Retribution, the location where contribution points were exchanged for items and valuables. They were the ones in control of the whole contribution point system. However, the rewards were paid by both the Gate of Retribution and all the major families of the western region.</p><p>&quot;Oh this contribution point system is rather smart,&quot; the elder said with an approving nod of his head, and while Hui Yue entered the Gates of Retribution, he flew to the back of the main building and entered a side building.</p><p>&quot;Halt!&quot; someone called out, but the elder flicked his hand, and a symbol appeared in his palm. The moment this symbol appeared the one who had called out shook as if he had been caught doing something wrong by his own ancestor.</p><p>&quot;Humph, now you know,&quot; the old man said as he walked up a set of stairs until he reached the upper levels of the building.</p><p>This building was filled with many rooms. These rooms were all offices, and the old man seemed to be very familiar with the layout of the building.</p><p>Had Hui Yue been able to see this, then he would have been stunned silly. The elder went to the largest of the doors and opened them without even knocking first.</p><p>&quot;What do you...&quot; someone said loudly clearly quite angry, but as he turned to look at who it was that entered his office, and his words slowly trailed off.</p><p>&quot;Master!&quot; he called out. &quot;Master! Please excuse this lowly one; I did not know it was you.&quot;</p><p>Rising from his chair and giving a great bow to the elderly man, the office worker offered his chair, the only chair within the room, to the elderly man. Accepting his offer, the elder slowly sat down.</p><p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said with a smile on his face and only then did the office worker relax slightly. This person was no ordinary office worker. He was, in fact, the leading person behind the Gate of Retribution. He managed everything that had to do with the daily tasks of running the guild, but in front of this old man, he was nothing.</p><p>&quot;I am here to praise you,&quot; he said with a nod of his head. &quot;Your idea with contribution points is a very good way to get more people hunting the Blood Demons!&quot;</p><p>He waved his hand, and a large mountain of Worldpower Stones appeared on the table. &quot;I too wish to provide a little to this,&quot; he said with a smile on his face.</p><p>His words caused the breath of the director to get stuck in his throat. If this was a small amount of wealth, then he did not know what a lot was.</p><p>&quot;Master, you really do not have to do this,&quot; he said hurriedly while waving his hands as if he wasere panicked. &quot;We are already providing a lot from the Gate of Retribution, master needs not pay extra!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Director Yuan, I am providing these Worldpower Stones to the killers because I wish for more people to kill those damned Blood Demons. Buy a peerless treasure and put it up for sale for a great amount of contribution points. Promote the item and make sure every cultivator knows they need points to obtain it. I want everyone to go crazy with greed at the thought that through killing they will be able to obtain a peerless treasure that they otherwise would never be able to even touch; I want them to eagerly slay the demons.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t want even one Blood Demon to remain in our whole western region.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing is more important than getting rid of the Blood Demons. Even if we have to sacrifice quite a few humans to do so, it is worth it,&quot; this old man said with a sinister expression on his face. It was clear that his enmity with the Blood Demons was no less than Hui Yue&apos;s.</p><p>&quot;Master&apos;s wish is my command,&quot; Director Yuan said with a deep bow, and the elderly man nodded his head. It was clear that he had an amazing amount of authority within the Gate of Retribution, but as for what exactly his rank was, it was never mentioned in the conversation.</p><p>Having done what he planned to do, the elderly man rose from the chair and left the office. He left behind a sweating director who wiped the sweat off his brows with the back of his hand.</p><p>&quot;The old master is always so intense!&quot; he muttered before he turned to see the mountain of Worldpower Stones in front of him, there was at least a million present in the pile.</p><p>Frowning, he felt a headache coming his way. He had to find a treasure that everyone would want, but doing so was in no way an easy task. Even if he had a million Worldpower Stones, people who had their hands on such treasures would not easily let them go.</p><p>Leaving all of this to Director Yuan, the elderly man waited silently outside of the main building of the Gates of Retribution. He hid his aura and hid himself, so that no one would be able to sense him unless they were on the same level as him.</p><p>After half an hour Hui Yue and his friend emerged from within the building. The only change for them was that now they had bracelets on their arms. These bracelets counted the energy of every Blood Demon that was killed and based on how strong they were adds a score to the amount of point they earn.</p><p>Having gotten their bracelets, they sat out to explore the vast western expanse of the galaxy. Leaving, they encountered no Blood Demons, but instead, many squads that were seeking out the Blood Demons. Some were on their way out while others were on their way back from their mission.</p><p>There were some of them who had sustained serious injuries while others were completely unharmed.</p><p>The one thing that all of them had in common was that they all looked at Hui Yue and his group with reverence. Had they been just a bit stronger than the others then there might have been jealousy, but everyone knew that this group of cultivators was leagues ahead of everyone else. For this reason, everyone admired them.</p><p>Only few Blood demon hunting squads were jealous of Hui Yue, and they all used the excuse that Hui Yue and his group was outstanding because of their sheer numbers.</p><p>It was indeed true that they had the benefit of quite a few people, but everyone in his group was outstandingly strong, so the friends really did not care about the gossip that others spread about Hui Yue&#x2019;s squad of cultivators. If their strength was doubted, then that was not their problem, but a problem of the ones who doubted them. They would be the ones who would end up black and blue, beaten to a pulp if they tried to underestimate them.</p><p>While they flew further and further away from the world of the Gate of Retribution, they came across more and more demons, and all of these Blood Demons had one common ending, being slain by Hui Yue&#x2019;s group.</p><p>Unfortunately, they moved around in small groups of ten at most, and although Hui Yue only needed a moment to kill ten Blood Demons, it took him some time to locate them.</p><p>Because of this, he started to wonder just how long it would take for him to kill a hundred thousand of them. Thinking about it, he knew he only had a year to do so.</p><p>&quot;It would be good to be ambushed again,&quot; he sighed, his thoughts returning to the time he had been ambushed by a million Blood Demons. Hearing this, the others could only shake their heads while chuckling wryly.</p><p>Although if this happened again, he would probably kill the required number of demons, back then his life was truly in danger as a result of that massive explosion and the resulting spatial fractures. Not to mention that it was precisely that situation which had caused their current predicament and the reason for these current trials. Had he not been ambushed then he would have not killed the great-grandson of this supreme expert.</p><p>&quot;Oh well, we will just continue killing them,&quot; Hui Yue sighed as he turned into a beam of light shooting out into the void.</p><p>What he and the others were unaware of was that the last two months while they had flown around killing Blood Demons, they had been tailed the entire time by the elderly expert.</p><p>He had seen every action they performed and heard every word they said, and he was astonished.</p><p>He understood that even if this young man failed to kill a hundred thousand Blood Demons, then he was not someone he could kill. At least not until the war with the demons had ended. His leadership and the speed with which he slaughtered the Blood Demons was too outstanding.</p><p>Time slowly ticked by as Hui Yue encountered more and more demons slaying them all, but he also started wondering where exactly their main base in the western region was?</p><p>He had been killing demons after demons and the density of Blood Demons was only increasing the the further into the western region he went, but there were also more and more hunter squads who had come to kill them. The fighting in the surrounding area was quite intense, but it was clear that the humans were still in control of this sector.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry too much about it,&quot; Lan Feng shrugged his shoulders. He had always been a lot more carefree than Hui Yue. &quot;We will meet them when the time comes, for now, let&#x2019;s just weed them out as well as we can.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue knew that wondering about it would not help him, but he was still confused. Was there a world that was hidden from everyone but the Blood Demons?</p><p>Shaking his head, Hui Yue decided not to think more about it. It was now half a year since he had started slaying demons for this trial, and he had killed around forty thousand. He realized that if he wanted to finish the trial and keep his life, then he needed to start killing faster.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x2019;s enter a city,&quot; he finally said after much deliberation. &quot;We need to get information about the places where most Blood Demons gather. Although it might be risky, it is better than continuing to search like this; we are wasting far too much time.&quot;</p><p>The others just nodded their heads, saying nothing too serious. If Hui Yue had made a decision, then they would follow him.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
