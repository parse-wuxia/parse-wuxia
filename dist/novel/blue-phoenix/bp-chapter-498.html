Did it ever cross your mind that you had received far too much kindness from me considering your rank was so pitiful?&quot; Rong Liang snorted. &quot;It is true that my children have grown some kind of fondness for you, but neither of them knows the truth about master or my strength. I am sure that after they learn, they will understand that to become a powerful expert one must rely on others for support.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master offered me such support and tremendous power. He offered me a galaxy so outstanding and vast that I could never traverse it all. I would shelter him from an inferno and walk on a mountain of sharp blades for him. Killing you is the least I can do for him!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">All the words that Rong Liang spoke shook the entire city, and all the Saints who had been there previously felt much calmer. They knew that this world belonged to Rong Liang and his master. For Hui Yue to suddenly revolt, he would clearly be killed. Even Hui Yue&apos;s own friends amongst the Saints were sure that his life was forfeit.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As Rong Liang spoke, Rong Ming and Rong Xing were both watching the two figures in the air. Their faces were devoid of all blood, and their eyes were wide as their entire bodies trembled.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their hearts shuddering with disbelief and fear as their minds screamed out in shock. Their father was a General under An He! They knew what this meant, and they also understood that this meant that Hui Yue and their father could not exist under the same sky. But who should they support? What should they do?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Rong Ming and Rong Xing were very filial. They had lost their mother at an early age, and their father had taken care of them since then. For his sake, they had decided to not focus on their cultivation but instead focus on increasing the strength of the Taiyang Kingdom; the kingdom their father had always been so proud of.</p><p dir="ltr">But while they adored their father, they also felt a kinship towards Hui Yue. He was their friend they had known for so many years, and they respected him with all their heart. In their mind, the two most important people, apart from their twin, was Rong Liang and Hui Yue. Now the world had turned against them. Fate had put those two people they held dear up against one another. No matter who won, Rong Ming and Rong Xing knew that it would be devastating.</p><p dir="ltr">Ma Kong and Gao Yan had reached Rong Ming and Rong Xing&apos;s side. At first, it was clear that they wanted to ask whether or not these two twins were aware of their father&apos;s status, but upon seeing the pain and suffering in their eyes, they quickly decided to keep their mouths shut. No words were necessary to explain what they were currently feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">All over the city every strong person had gathered up and was observing the two supreme experts floating in the air. Many dared not to even breath as they feared that the two extreme experts would turn to them in their rage and kill them. A single glare from experts at this level was likely to be able to kill weak experts like them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yue!&quot; Wang Ju Long called out as they heard Rong Liang&apos;s voice boom throughout the city, and all the friends who had been heading to the mansion instantly turned around. It was true that they were supposed to be safe, but they all felt trepidation in their hearts. Could it truly be the case that Hui Yue, who had just become a God, was able to fight someone who had been a God for thousands of years?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone, even Huli, had fear on their face and she swept her eyes across everyone present. &quot;I promised to keep you all safe!&quot; She said, &quot;and safe I will keep you. Let us rush to Yue&apos;s side but don&apos;t leave my side, or I cannot guarantee your safety.&quot; She ordered, and this time not even Sha Yun questioned her orders, she just nodded her head resolutely. The others mimicked her reaction. Hui Yue was far more important than a small discussion between two women.</p><p dir="ltr">There were no words spoken between Hui Yue and Rong Liang for a long time. The two experts looked at one another, and both remembered the past they shared. Hui Yue, who had felt as if Rong Liang was a second father was obviously shocked, and even more so when he realized that this man had only gotten close to him because of Lan Feng who was hidden within his body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Rong Liang was musing about how this long mission which made him pretend to be a mere City Lord and then a Saint was finally coming to an end. He was glad that he was finally able to reveal his true strength and that he no longer needed to hide within the Divine Beast World.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing, Hui Yue rolled his neck and closed his eyes for a brief moment. Every memory he had shared with Rong Liang was buried deep within, and when he once more opened his eyes, they were filled with boundless killing intent and determination.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You might be like a second father to me, but the enmity between An He and I cannot be resolved.&quot; Hui Yue said. He no longer enhanced his voice with Ancestral Worldpower, but the city was so quiet that everyone present could hear what he said. &quot;You chose to follow An He, and that is the decision which will cause your death.&quot; Hui Yue said brutally as his aura exploded outwards and all his energy started rotating through his body.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this, Rong Liang snorted in contempt. &quot;You&#x2019;ve just become a God.&quot; He laughed out loud. &quot;How can someone like you possibly challenge me? Do you know the mysteries of the Dao? Do you know what a God&apos;s true strength is? What do you even know apart from brute strength? Nothing! You are nothing in front of me!&quot; Rong Liang laughed, and his body turned into a blur as he charged towards Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who heard every single word Rong Liang spoke, was filled with shock. The Dao? The true strength of a God? What were all these things and why had the beasts Gods not told him? Why had Huli not told him? Was his path truly the wrong way?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Being overwhelmed by thoughts, Hui Yue shook his head. Now was not the time to question what he knew and suddenly one thought appeared in his mind. He had understood one thing, and that was that his crude attempts at controlling Ancestral Worldpower would not be enough for him to win this battle so instead he searched deep within himself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He found the eternal flame which was burning within his chest and called out for the flame to enter his body. The moment he did a searing heat spreading through every limb, and soon the Ancestral Worldpower within his body had taken on the elemental affinity of the fire element. Quickly, Hui Yue&apos;s entire body was bathed in flames.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A resounding screech escaped Hui Yue&apos;s lips as the flames around his body kept growing in shape and size until they eventually resembled a massive Vermilion Bird. The screech that Hui Yue had released caused a few houses close by to be blown away from just the shockwave alone. The heat caused the ground beneath Hui Yue to crack, and every building that was still standing nearby was catching fire. Hui Yue suddenly swung his wings and flew into the air.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He circled a few times around Rong Liang, and his flaming eyes were filled with endless killing intent as the massive bird kept picking up its pace. After accelerating, Hui Yue suddenly made a sharp turn and descended at lightning speed towards Rong Liang.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Is this the true Phoenix Descent?&quot; Rong Liang asked shocked to his core. He had previously been in the red realm and had gone through some of the same trials that Hui Yue and his friends went through. He too had to decipher the Phoenix Descent and make a skill of it. Back then he had only been able to make a simple fireball, but when he saw the true Phoenix Descent in front of him, he had no doubt about what it was.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see you have some tricks up your sleeve well so do I!&quot; Rong Liang called out as black ancestral worldpower permeated outwards from his body. The energy seemed deadly, and Hui Yue instantly understood that he could not afford to come into contact with this energy. It was clear that it was poisonous or at least had some corrosive ability to it.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I fail to believe it can withstand my fire!&quot; Hui Yue yelled full of pride. His flame was not an ordinary flame but an eternal flame. A flame which was many times more potent than other flames. Hui Yue flapped his wings a few times before he shot out three balls of fire which shot towards Rong Liang quickly and exploded as they came into contact with the black mist.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had been correct. Although this black energy was powerful, it was not more powerful than his eternal flame, and as they exploded, Rong Liang was forced backwards around ten steps. Although he was forced backwards, there were no signs of him being wounded or having suffered from their first exchange of blows.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are truly a genius!&quot; Rong Liang laughed loudly as he extinguished the flames that had latched onto his body. &quot;Although you are a genius there is a limit to your power. You just became a God; you cannot defeat me!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was high in the sky, looking exactly like the Vermilion Bird. His aura was so terrifying and imposing that the experts observing this battle felt their hearts quiver in fear and their legs go limp. Though what they feared, even more, was Rong Liang who could take the attacks of this dreaded bird head on as if it were nothing at all.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, realizing that he had no chance of defeating Rong Liang the way things were going, now understood that there were only a few ways for him to win. He could not depend on his Ancestral Worldpower to beat Rong Liang, but he knew he had energies that others did not have. As another terrifying screech sounded out, Hui Yue dove towards Rong Liang. Activating the true Phoenix Descent, he put all the power he had behind this attack. He had other means to continue the battle afterward, but if he could end Rong Liang in one go, it would definitely be worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this all out attack Rong Liang was surprised, but then he laughed once more. &quot;So desperate that you already want to end the fight?&quot; He grinned, and the black energy surrounded him once more. &quot;I don&apos;t mind. Let us see who has the best defense!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Soon the black and red energies collided. At some places the fire was burning the black energy, causing it to be engulfed in flames, while at other places the flames were being corroded and being consumed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Both energies were fighting for every inch against one another. Each cultivator was pushing their energy to its limits, and even Rong Liang was forced to take it seriously.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master!&quot; Suddenly Huli&apos;s voice boomed through the air, but Hui Yue called out through gritted teeth. &quot;Stay away! This is my battle!&quot; Before he once more focused his entire strength against Rong Liang. Huli, who had been told to stay away, had a look of worry on her face, but she did not participate in the fight. For once, she listened to Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;If you die, I will personally kill all your enemies and then find you in the Netherworld.&quot; Huli mumbled to herself. Tears were welling up in her eyes as she saw Hui Yue losing more and more ground against Rong Liang.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
