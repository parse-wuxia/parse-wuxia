During this time they formed a great friendship with the other sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Gao Li was unable to deal with Hui Yue and his Ten Suns formation, he still became more and more ferocious in their fights. Now, he would, without a doubt, be a headache for anyone who did not have such a violent fire formation under their control.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While the two were busy understanding formations and increasing their understanding of how to best use these formations in combat, Pei Bai and the Old Weasel were constantly switching between winning and losing against the other. Their strength was simply too similar.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">During this month, Gao Li had started learning other formations than just snow-related ones. He had seen from the Old Weasel that if his snow melted, then it would be a good idea to be proficient in water formations that could also fight fire formations.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Gao Li had started learning these formations, he had not managed to gain mastery over them just yet. For this reason, he could struggle for longer, but he could still not defeat Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, the day arrived when they could no longer linger around in the Heavenly Dragon Gate&apos;s World, and it was about time for Hui Yue and Pei Bai to return to the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will visit you,&quot; Gao Li promised as he already thought of Hui Yue as one of his good friends. A friend who might not value the same things as Hui Yue, but they were both interested in the formation arts and were able to have heated discussions and friendly battles.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I look forward to seeing you,&quot; Hui Yue nodded and said seriously. He had benefited greatly from the many battles with Gao Li and watching the fights between their teachers.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had also managed to compress a full thirty-seven seals during the month, and his speed of advancement had shocked both Gao Li, the Weasel, and Pei Bai.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was aware that the reason he was still doing as well as he was, was because of his soul being incredibly powerful and having an outstanding amount of soulforce.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their goodbye was brief, and none of them were sentimental. Two were old friends and rivals, while the other two were new friends and new rivals. When looking at the two younger experts, both Pei Bai and the Old Weasel felt nostalgic. They were dragged back to the time when the two of them had met for the first time and started their life-long rivalry.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they finished their goodbyes, Pei Bai picked up a communication orb and contacted the guards who had been in the city for the past month.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they gathered at Dragon&apos;s Peak, Hui Yue was surprised. There were three guards missing, and some of them had been beaten silly. All of them were Immortals of Creation yet, even so, they had been beaten into a state where not even their mothers would recognize them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When his eyes landed on this large group of experts, Pei Bai&apos;s eyes turned cold. It was not just him, but the eyes of the Old Weasel also turned frosty.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What happened?&quot; Pei Bai asked in a low, dangerous voice. He was clearly very displeased.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">No one spoke at the start, but then the pressure from Pei Bai descended upon these guards. Finally, one of them took a step forward and cleared his throat.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;After entering the city, we split up into smaller groups. One of our brothers went to the Black Marketplace and bought some items. But it turns out that afterwards he got drunk and bragged about the items he had bought.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Later on, he was assaulted on his way back to the inn. He was not alone, and our brothers saved him. Unfortunately, they ended up killing the assailant&#x2026; But the one who attacked was none other than the young master of the Chen family!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was unaware of who the Chen family was but from what it sounded like they were rather important within the Heavenly Dragon Gate&apos;s World.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Since the incident, we have been attacked time and time again, and from the attacks, we lost three brothers!&quot; It was obvious from his facial expressions how much pain he was in because of the brothers they had lost. These guards were all brothers and friends and to lose someone was truly a heartbreaking experience. This was especially the case when they had spent thousands of years side by side.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;All of us got beaten black and blue as you can see, but at least we were able to keep our lives.&quot; the guard finished speaking and sighed as he shook his head. He clearly regretted that the drunk guard hadn&#x2019;t kept his mouth shut about the treasure he had bought.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What kind of treasure could make those experts from the Chen family take action?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously, and the guard was silent for a short while before he shook his head and finally said, &quot;It was supposedly a Pill of Clarity made by the Alchemist God sold by some old man!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This brother of ours spent his entire savings to buy this pill because he was stuck at a bottleneck while comprehending the dao.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Hui Yue&apos;s face suddenly turned strange. No one understood what he was thinking, but he was actually blaming himself. Someone selling Pills of Clarity made by the Alchemist God... Were these not the same pills he had sold back in Diyu? How had they ended up so far away from where he had sold them? Had they spread across the entire galaxy already?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;No matter what kind of treasure it was, for the Chen family to assault the guests of our Heavenly Dragon Gate, do they really not wish to keep living in our world?!&quot; The Old Weasel exclaimed in anger before he waved his hand and a small horn appeared in his hands.</p><p dir="ltr">After blowing into the horn, a group of experts suddenly appeared behind the Old Weasel. All of them were stronger than even the guards that Pei Bai and Hui Yue had brought with them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&#x2019;s go and pay a visit to the Chen family!&quot; he continued with a hint of coldness in his eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">No one questioned his authority to deal with the Chen family; everyone followed behind the Old Weasel as they made their way through the city. At the front was Pei Bai and the Old Weasel. Behind them were Gao Li and Hui Yue and following them came the experts that the Old Weasel had called for. Finally after them were Hui Yue and Pei Bai&#x2019;s guards and at the very back were the ones who had been beaten black and blue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they walked through the city, everyone stopped what they were doing and watched this massive group of cultivators as they walked through the city with a ferocious and murderous aura.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They did not have to walk far before they reached the Chen family compound, and as they did, the Old Weasel did not even stand on ceremony as over nine hundred and fifty seals appeared around him. Nine hundred of these seals all took the shape of a massive behemoth. It was like a gigantic furry ape with white fur. From the back were multiple ice shards and the size of this ape was so tall that the gate to the Chen family compound seemed to be made of toothpicks rather than large iron bars in comparison.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Halt!&quot; someone from inside yelled and soon after an expert no weaker than Pei Bai appeared flying in the sky. His face was slightly pale, but within his eyes, anger smoldered.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Chen Jun!&quot; The Old Weasel called out with a growling voice. His face was showing even more anger than the patriarch of the Chen family&#x2019;s face was. When the patriarch saw the Old Weasel, his face turned even paler than before. His eyes were no longer filled with anger but flashed with worry and slight fear.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Old Master Yang Juan!&quot; he exclaimed as he quickly bowed to the Old Weasel. &quot;I am unaware of what might have transpired to cause you to seek out my family and cause such a ruckus,&quot; he said. His voice contained genuine confusion, but the Old Weasel, who Hui Yue just realized was called Yang Juan, snorted.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have been conducting the Formation Master&apos;s debate just recently, and during this time, the guards of the various sects have been visiting our dear city. Now do you really not know about this matter of your son and the guards of the Celestial Sword Sect, or are you just acting the fool?&quot; The Old Weasel inquired his voice filled with hostility. It was clear that he did not believe that this old man knew nothing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The... The Celestial Sword Sect?&quot; The Chen family patriarch turned so pale that his face seemed to be made from wax. &quot;I truly do not know, elder, please enlighten me.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The Chen family was the largest family within the Heavenly Dragon Gate&apos;s World, only surpassed by the Heavenly Dragon Gate itself. But what was such a small family when compared to the gigantic sect such as the Celestial Sword Sect? Just one their guardian sects alone could wipe out the entire Chen family not to even mention the main sect.</p><p dir="ltr">Snorting, Yang Juan explained what had transpired, and the more he spoke, the more listless the patriarch of the Chen family became.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I understand,&quot; he finally said with a sigh. &quot;I deeply apologize for my son&apos;s rash behavior. To have lost three dedicated guards and even gotten other guards beaten up not only is it a disgrace to the Heavenly Dragon Gate, but it is also a direct insult to the Celestial Sword Sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">He was hesitating because he knew that his son had no way of surviving this ordeal. He had orchestrated the death of members of the Celestial Sword Sect. He had stolen from them, and he had tainted the name of the Heavenly Dragon Gate.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your son succeeded in stealing a Pill of Clarity,&quot; Hui Yue suddenly said, something that no one else had thought about before. &quot;This pill cost our faithful guard his entire life savings, money that could have gone to his widowed wife and his fatherless children. Instead, the pill has been stolen by your son. I hope you can return this pill to us, if not then the wealth equivalent to buy such a pill created by the Alchemist God will suffice; If not, don&apos;t blame us for being rude.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The patriarch felt slightly annoyed being spoken to like this by a member of the younger generation, but he dared not show any annoyance on his face. Instead, he started sweating profoundly. He knew that his son had returned two days prior and had gone straight into secluded cultivation. It was clear that he had already consumed the pill.</p><p dir="ltr">To pay for such a pill was no easy matter. But even so, it should be possible for him to afford it. That was until Hui Yue sent a brilliant smile at the patriarch, one that made him shiver with a slight trace of fear.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, your family did kill three of our guards and stole a priceless pill. I am sure that a million Worldpower Stones is enough to compensate for our losses. Don&apos;t thank me for being so kind just make sure to pay up.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, the patriarch almost spat out blood and everyone present stared at Hui Yue with eyes widened to the extreme.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One million Worldpower Stones! What kind of fortune was this?! It was simply something no one could ever afford! Even a family like the Chen family would only be able to afford it if they sold all their assets. Still, this was a way for them to allow for the son to survive, and the patriarch was feeling uncertain if he should just hand over his son or if he should accept the offer.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I think you misunderstand me,&quot; Hui Yue said guessing what the patriarch was thinking as he smiled once more. Each of his smiles seemed to suck out the lifeforce out of the patriarch making him fear this young man in front of him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am not interested in the life and death of your son. Whether he lives or dies, you pay up. The pill has most likely already been consumed, and we have a widowed wife and fatherless children that need to be fed for years to come. So you pay up or give us the pill that was stolen. As to whether or not your son lives, that is up to Elder Yang Juan to decide.&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
