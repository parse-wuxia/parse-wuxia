He looked at the two pills which appeared out of nowhere and floated to his hand. One was black with the symbol of a butterfly, and the other was fiery red with the symbol of a flame. It was easy to tell the pills from one another.</p><p dir="ltr">These two pills were amazing. One could enhance and solidify his strength while the other was a life-saving treasure. The existence of such heaven-defying pills surprised Hui Yue greatly. Looking at these two amazing pills, he realized he was like a frog in a well. He had thought he was close to the peak of alchemy, but now he realized how mistaken he truly was. Touching the pills in his hand, he felt two conflicting energies erupted from them. One was volatile, potent and fiery while the other was dark and intimidating.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Don&apos;t just stare at them.&apos; Lan Feng said excitedly. &apos;Absorb them! Let us experience what this eternal flame is!&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Although this pill was originally for Lan Feng, it was now Hui Yue who was going to consume it, but even so, Lan Feng felt no jealousy or regret. Hui Yue was his brother, his best friend, and his hope of getting back his body and getting revenge. A pill would not change his view on Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Not only that, Hui Yue and Lan Feng had a merged soul. What Hui Yue could control, Lan Feng could similarly control. As such, when Hui Yue got his hands on an eternal flame, Lan Feng too would be able to do use the flame as well. Therefore the Vermilion Bird&apos;s dream of having his son inherit this Eternal Flame pill was actually not that far from coming true.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue and Lan Feng were both excited, and with a flick of his hand, Hui Yue stored the pill of Samsara within the Universe Box before he sat down. Though, the moment the pill entered the box Hui Yue felt a suction force and his consciousness was drawn into the box. The spirit of the Universe Box was waiting for him. His face was pale, and his eyes were lit with anger.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously as he looked at the spirit. It was clear that he was unhappy with something.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This pill&#x2026; &quot; The Universe Box&apos;s spirit pointed to the pill of Samsara which was hovering in front of him. &quot;This pill was created by my late master&apos;s master! How did you get your hands on it? Is there any news about grandmaster Alchemist God?!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that this was something which mattered greatly to the Universe Box, but as to why Hui Yue had no idea.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is a gift from the Vermilion Bird for passing one of his trials.&quot; Hui Yue answered honestly. &quot;I have two pills made from the Alchemist God, but one of them I am about to consume. The other I will use if my life is ever in trouble.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding his head, the spirit seemed to think for some time. All the while Hui Yue felt that his soul was still trapped within this godly treasure. He had never known that the spirit was capable of trapping him like this.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The Alchemist God was the master of my late master. You should have guessed long ago that master was an alchemist of high standing due to how many pills he had in his grave, alongside the many pill formulas you&apos;ve received me.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Seven thousand years ago grandmaster Alchemist God vanished without a trace; no one knows what happened to him. My master&apos;s biggest dream was to find him once more, but he was mortally wounded and had to leave behind his legacy. Tell me, are you willing to trade some years of your future for the sake of gaining his legacy?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was surprised when he heard this and slightly startled. &quot;Trade years of my life... What do you mean?&quot; He asked curiously. For him, a few years did not matter as he was merged with the green witch. He had learned from her memories how to use and harvest lifeforce from other beings. Even if he gave away hundreds of years of life, then he could gain them again.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Universe Box resided within his body, it did not know about the strange phenomenon in his lower dantian, his previous lives.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What I want is not lifeforce.&quot; The Universe Box continued. &quot;What I want is for you to go and find out what happened to our missing master the Alchemist God. That was what my master wished for more than anything else.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue thought for some time. He already had plenty of things he needed to do, but he felt like he owed the elder from the Grave of the Unknown. Not only did he take all his items, but he had also stopped his plans for resurrection.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have a few things I need to do first.&quot; The young expert said slowly while still contemplating. &quot;Although, when those are finished then I don&apos;t mind spending some time figuring out what happened to the Alchemist God.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The spirit nodded his head. &quot;Since you agree to help me fulfill my late master&apos;s wish then I will support you in your travels. From time to time get me more of these storage stones. Absorbing their energy makes it possible for me to regain my power; the power to contain the entire universe.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing these words, Hui Yue was stunned, but he could not truly believe what the spirit had said. Shaking his head, he decided to think about it later.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;When you leave this place and have some time, then I will impart master&#x2019;s legacy to you. Although you might have time now, your mind is not able to focus fully on the information. Also, you don&apos;t have the strength to inherit his legacy just yet, you will need to become a God for that.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding his head, Hui Yue understood. The person whose legacy he was going to inherit was a God. Therefore, it was only natural that he needed the same strength to be able to learn his techniques, formulas, and insights.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly the force which had made Hui Yue enter the Universe Box vanished, and he returned to his body, slightly nauseous but also enlightened.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Lan Feng knew anything that Hui Yue knew, so he did not question what had happened. Instead, he felt excited much like Hui Yue. The legacy of a master alchemist was something they could definitely benefit from. The better their strength, the better their chances against An He.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Okay, now that this has been sorted let us consume the pill!&apos; Lan Feng urged. Impatience was painted all over his face, and he was simply incapable of waiting any longer. His expression was the most childish one Hui Yue had ever seen on him, and he could not help but laugh when he heard the excitement in Lan Feng&apos;s voice.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will, I will.&quot; He said out loud as he looked at the pill in his hand. He too felt excited as he slowly placed it in his mouth, shaking from a mixture of excitement and anticipation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He did not know what to expect. Perhaps it would be a baptism of pain, perhaps it would be as refreshing as bathing in a stream of water, but he really had no idea what would happen.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the pill entered his mouth, it turned into a warm liquid that scalded his tongue making it numb. The numbness was comfortable reminding Hui Yue of how it felt when he drank a cup of tea before allowing it to cool off. Soon this heat spread throughout his entire body, making him comfortably warm. He felt as though he had been sitting in the summer sunshine for hours which made his entire body so comfortable that he almost lost himself to the feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">Wake up from that feeling, Hui Yue suddenly noticed that deep within his middle dantian, where the elemental flames were present, something was changing. All the flames which had already increased in size once more started growing; this time they did not grow to double their previous size but an astonishing four times their original size, and the flame for Fire grew an outstanding six times over!</p><p dir="ltr">It was not only the size which changed, but the color turned red instead of blue. This was not a red Hue Yue had seen before. The red color it was before was almost orange with yellow specks in it, while now it was dark red with golden specks within. The difference was truly astonishing, and the flames&#x2019; aura was now many times hotter. It was so overwhelmingly powerful that Hui Yue almost felt intimidated from just looking at it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Not only did the elemental flames change, but the nature of his Ancestral Worldpower within his body also started to change. It roared as though it were a dragon and started to rush through his entire body. The energy was refined even more and combined with the flames from his middle dantian. Soon the fire attribute of the Ancestral Worldpower became much purer. It was no longer just fire attributed Ancestral Worldpower, but fire attributed Ancestral Worldpower with an eternal flame.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue opened his eyes. There had been no pain during the whole process. He knew that was attributed to the quality of the pill, and that this pill was without a doubt the most outstanding pill he had ever consumed before. He was shocked that when eating it there had been no pain because the benefits were simply outstanding. To be able to create pills like this, it was clear that he was worthy of the name Alchemist God.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;That was it?&apos; Lan Feng asked shocked. He had expected something more. Truthfully, so had Hui Yue, but not much had happened. His flame control was now much more accurate, and his flame had been upgraded to a higher level flame. The flame he had now was of the highest grade and his strength had soared. They both had their doubts because the process was so straightforward and simple. There had been no pain and no hardship in &#xE1;bsorbing this medicinal pill.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Let us not rush to the final trial.&apos; Hui Yue said hesitantly. &apos;We don&apos;t know if suddenly this pill will change something within me. Let&#x2019;s wait for a few hours and see if anything else happens, if nothing occurs then, we will start the last trail.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Lan Feng nodded his head. What Hui Yue said made perfect sense. If any side effects happened while they were undertaking the trial, then they were certain to fail. The trial was already so hard that no one had passed it, how could Hui Yue and Lan Feng not be extra careful?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One hour went by while Hui Yue was quietly cultivating, but nothing happened. Another hour went by but still the only thing which occurred was his body slowly refining the energy within.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Opening his eyes, Hui Yue was almost certain that there was no more chance of any side effects but to be completely certain he started practicing. He trained one attack after another before he finally stopped, sitting down to cultivate once more. Nothing had happened while he was training; nothing happened while he was cultivating. It seemed that he had fully absorbed the pill, and Hui Yue was excited about starting the final trial.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let the third test begin!&quot; Hui Yue said with a firm voice. Right after a beam of silvery energy descended from the ceiling landing right between Hui Yue&apos;s eyebrows. This energy caused him to collapse.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Not again. &apos; Lan Feng sighed to himself unable to do anything. He stayed within the lower dantian and started cultivating while waiting for Hui Yue to awaken from the dreamland he had been sent to. Moving around with the body was no help to anyone. If suddenly the Vermilion Bird misunderstood and thought he had passed the trial, it was likely that Hui Yue would spend the rest of his life stuck in that dreamland. This thought caused Lan Feng to stay put in the lower dantian and cultivate quitely.</p><br></div><p></p>
