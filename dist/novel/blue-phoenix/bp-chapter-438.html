Some left presents at the front door while others insisted on delivering their presents in person. Seeing how many people arrived, it was easy to see how big a role Hui Yue now played in Muchuan City.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Even the princess came by, but she only stayed for a short time while she conversed with Hui Yue, Rong Liang, and a few others. As the princess, she was aware of Rong Liang&apos;s new position and showed him respect. His job was clearly very important, and this task had been given to him by someone with a great rank. It was clear he was looked upon with favor and because of this other wished to get in his good graces. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue had a great night. Although he greeted many experts, he spent the majority of his time together with his friends. During the entire night, Huli laid in his warm embrace. Wang Ju Long and Sha Yun were rushing everywhere being the perfect hosts and ordering the servants about to ensure that everyone had a glass of wine in their hands and that they never ran out of delicacies to eat. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Finally, after a long night, the sun rose in the sky and the last people remaining left the mansion, leaving only Hui Yue, Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long in the large dining hall. Lao had returned to cultivate and so had Jo. Xu Piao had been greatly motivated seeing Hui Yue breakthrough his bottleneck, and he too retreated to cultivate. Deng Wu was the last one of their friends to leave as he also wished to increase his cultivation base. Having seen Hui Yue reach the Saint rank caused everyone to become eager to train harder. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Slumping to the ground, Hui Yue sighed deeply. &quot;Having guests is much more troublesome than cultivating.&quot; He complained as he took the hands of Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long and dragged them into a warm embrace. This rejuvenated his energies by feeling the closeness of the women he loved. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hugging him, neither woman resisted and heard a grateful sigh from Hui Yue. This caused them to both smile as well. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Will you go get the Formation of Life now?&quot; Sha Yun asked curiously, but Hui Yue shook his head, surprising both her and Wang Ju Long. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The temptation of the Formation of Life was difficult to ignore; even the two women were eager to start the trip to the Central Palace and get their hands on the formation. However, it seemed Hui Yue had other plans.</span></p><br><p><span style="">His face which had been full of tenderness filled with anger, and Hui Yue shook his head. &quot;Before I became a Saint someone dared to challenge me.&quot; He said with a grim expression on his face. &quot;Challenging me is not a big deal but...&quot; He continued. &quot;Attempting to kill my friends and my daughter, that is something I cannot tolerate. I will get revenge first. I&#x2019;ll ensure that no one ever has the thought of hurting the ones I hold dear while I am gone. Never again will I let my friends suffer or get hurt because of me.&quot; He swore, and his eyes were filled with determination. Although things had gone well with Sha Yun, the entire experience had frightened and woken Hui Yue up. It caused him to understand how much he valued the ones he held dear.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;How will you find them?&quot; Wang Ju Long asked with a low voice. She too had been slightly worried, but she did not know any way to track down these masked experts, but Hui Yue just smiled. &quot;I have a plan.&quot; He said, &quot;but I will start tomorrow. Today, I want to relax and enjoy my time.&quot; He smiled and drew the women into one more hug, enveloping himself with the feeling of being at home with the ones he had sworn to protect.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The night passed quickly and morning sun rose along with Hui Yue. He left the mansion early and started visiting one great family after the other in the city. </span></p><br><p><span style="">He never hid his purpose and told everyone that he was coming for the sake of checking their auras to determine whether they had been the ones who threatened his family.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While the most of the families allowed him in, a few also refused and as soon as they refused Hui Yue executed their patriarchs. His strength had soared to the heavens, and he had become so strong that no one could put up a real fight; Hui Yue&apos;s retribution once more caused Muchuan City to be shocked. One of the experts invited Hui Yue in, in the belief that he would be unable to recognizing him; however, Hui Yue was able to recognize the auras of these experts and the moment he reached the hall where the expert was waiting, the battle began. Hui Yue made quick work of anyone who had gone against him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While some families felt threatened by this others did what they could to improve their relationship with Hui Yue and his family even though most felt worried and threatened, no one stopped him. From this, everyone understood that Hui Yue was someone they could not afford to anger. In the end, these six experts could only blame themselves for having angered him in the first place. This was a world where strength determined who was right, and everyone seeing Hui Yue&apos;s strength knew that no one in Muchuan City was his equal.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Having gotten retribution, Hui Yue returned to the mansion. &quot;It took you a full week to get rid of everyone.&quot; Wang Ju Long mused as she looked a Hui Yue. &quot;It actually did not take as long as we had thought, what will you do now?&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Well, that&apos;s obvious.&quot; Hui Yue said with a gleam in his eyes and a smile on his face. &quot;It&#x2019;s is time for a trip!.&quot; He grinned. &quot;The Formation of Life is hidden deep within the Central Palace, and it will help us reach the God rank much faster. I promised Zhong Fai that I would get my hands on it and assist him in becoming a God too; it&apos;s time I fulfilled my promise.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;There are some things I need to prepare beforehand. I need to look through everything I obtained from the grave because those items could possibly save our lives at some point. Also, no one will leave until we get our hands on the best equipment. I will forge new weapons for everyone other than you since I doubt I will be able to create a staff any better than the one you already have.&quot; He said with a smile, and Wang Ju Long nodded her head. The staff she had gotten her hands on long ago was a true mystery. The weasel spirit within was something no one really understood, but it increased Wang Ju Long&apos;s strength and made it so that she could unleash her full potential. Only Hui Yue had a weapon which could be compared to hers. As for the others, they all used weapons that Hui Yue had forged, but now he was far better at crafting, and the weapons he could create now had even fewer impurities not to mention their increase in power. </span></p><br><p><span style="">These weapons could easily be filled with Wu Wei; they were sharper than any other weapons in this world and so durable that nothing could break them. Weapons like these were of great help to any cultivator. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Thinking this, Hui Yue decided to bring with him all his friends who cultivated even Jo was to follow him. Although she was not the strongest in their team, her knowledge about how to use Wu Wei arts to the fullest made her very skilled in fighting Emperor ranked experts. She often sparred with her older brother, and although she did not win, she surely gave him a run for his money as he focused more on cultivation the Wu Wei arts. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Leaving behind Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long was never going to happen. In Hui Yue&apos;s world, these two were his companions, and he would always take them with him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Not only did he wish to have the two women in his life by his side, but he also wished for Lao and Jo to travel with him as well, and he couldn&apos;t forget Deng Wu.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Although Hui Yue was great friends with Ma Kong, Gao Yan, and the Rong twins, Hui Yue and Deng Wu had fought through life and death by each other&#x2019;s side through the Dungeons of the Divine. The two of them were martial brothers who would always fight back to back.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While Hui Yue was busy dealing with Saints in Muchuan City, Deng Wu had been fully submerged in necromancy. He had purchased outstanding soul spirits from high ranked magical beasts. He had managed to control a few corpses at a time, and he had learned how to best utilize his abilities in battles. He had often left the city to go hunting beasts in nearby forests and mountains to test his ability, especially after receiving the flying sword which made it far easier to travel.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue had searched far and wide, and tried to trade thousands of storage stones to the spirit of the Universe Box, however, he had been incapable of finding a Wu Wei art which increased the strength of soul shadows and other necromantic abilities.</span></p><br><p><span style="">This was the first time he had experienced such a thing, and he finally understood that although the Universe Box contained many things, it did not contain everything. </span></p><br><p><span style="">On this trip, Hui Yue also considered bringing Xu Piao along. Although they had not interacted much since the dungeons, Hui Yue understood how much gratitude the former felt for him. Especially after being told that he could save the love of his life if he managed to reach the God rank. By believing in Hui Yue, and by trusting the words the Frozen General had told him, Hui Yue knew he could help yet another friend of his. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You are aware that the Frozen General might be setting a trap for you?&quot; Deng Wu asked as the two friends were seated together in the library, chatting together about the Formation of Life. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I know.&quot; Hui Yue nodded his head. Even he had considered this possibility before, but what could he do? The Formation of Life had such outstanding abilities that anyone would risk heading into a trap for the sake of it.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Even if it turns out that it is a trap, I want to see who can block all of us.&quot; Hui Yue sighed as he looked up into the ceiling. &quot;I have you all by my side, and even if we meet a group of Saints, I believe in my ability to fight them. There should only be one God in this entire plane, and even if Zhong Fai gave information to this God, is he really in a position to order a God around? No one knows about me and my enmity against An He. Since no one knows, I doubt they will spend their energy to fight us.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Nodding his head, Deng Wu understood the logic behind what Hui Yue had said, but he still had a bad feeling about the whole ordeal. Although he was tempted to reach the God rank, he was not blinded by the powerful formation.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Sighing both Deng Wu and Hui Yue were seated deep in thought about the trip they were about to start very soon.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
