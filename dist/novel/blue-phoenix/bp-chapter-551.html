Even though many disciples and even some of the elders present wished to visit Hui Yue and curry favor with him, they were just too scared to do so.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Since apparently, nobody wanted to talk to them, Hui Yue and Pei Ze both left the dining hall after eating and went to their rooms.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They had been together all day and spoken a lot, but when they reached their rooms, Pei Ze said goodbye and entered his own room to cultivate.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was happy to say goodbye as he had quite a few things to deal with. He closed the door behind him and locked it making sure that he would not be interrupted.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A second after entering the quiet room, Hui Yue turned to Huli, &quot;Guard the room and don&apos;t let anyone enter.&quot; He asked before he entered the Universe Box and went straight to Muchuan City.</p><p dir="ltr">His visit was short because he was worried about what was happening in the Celestial Sword Sect, so he was not able to stay long. Thus he quickly met up with the beast Gods and told them what had happened that day, and that they were going to have to stay within the Divine Beast World for a while. They could not live with him in the Celestial Sword Sect, and it would be troublesome to have them wandering Youdu on their own.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gods were at first worried when they heard that being born outside of the sect carried a death sentence, but after hearing that he had been saved and that he was rather highly ranked, all of them felt much better.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Spending a bit of time with Jo and Lao, Hui Yue quickly returned to his room in the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Three people have been here and knocked on the door, but I told them that you were busy cultivating,&quot; Huli said proudly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After he returned, Hui Yue started to cultivate. Although he had joined the Celestial Sword Sect and was fawned upon by everyone as a third generation descendant, he knew that his status would be worth nothing in these upcoming trials. The only things that matter to become a Judge of Hell and rule the Netherworld was personal strength!</p><p dir="ltr">The next couple of days Hui Yue settled within the Celestial Sword Sect. He spent all his time in his room trying to perfect the dao of the sword. He could feel that he was close, but although he was close, he was not quite there just yet. If he wanted to be able to use swordlight without his sword, he had to fully comprehend the dao of the sword.</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue was busy cultivating Huli was by his side and ensured that any wayward swordlight erupting from his body while cultivating did not destroy the room.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She also ensured that every expert that came looking for Hui Yue was politely told that Hui Yue was busy cultivating. As soon as they heard this, everyone left in a rush as no one wished to interrupt his training.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">That was until one day a servant arrived and this servant was so persistent that no matter how many times Huli shooed him away, he stayed there claiming that he had a very important message to relay.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Huli, let him enter,&quot; Hui Yue finally said as the voice of the servant had already interrupted his cultivation. It was clear that this servant really had no other option than to stay until he had talked with Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sir, this lowly one truly apologizes for interfering with your training, but ancestor Pei Tian ordered me to deliver this communication orb to you. He wishes for you to contact him as soon as possible.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The servant seemed incredibly fearful, and Hui Yue was curious as to why one of the ancestors were looking for him. But he said nothing and accepted the communication orb. The moment he accepted the orb the servant bowed deeply and headed off. He did not stay for even a minute extra.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Strange...&quot; Hui Yue said as he looked at this fleeing servant and then the communication orb in his hand. Hui Yue did not know how the communication orb worked, but he had seen the Fu brothers use it by infusing their Ancestral Worldpower in it. Copying their action, he hoped he could get it to work. Although he did not understand why this ancestor Pei Tian needed to speak with him, he understood that it was not a good idea to make him wait for long.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As Ancestral Worldpower entered the communication orb, Hui Yue noticed that within was a small formation of some kind which activated. Moments later, a mist appeared in the communication orb which took the shape of a middle-aged man.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This middle-aged man was rather stern looking, but the moment his eyes landed on Hui Yue&apos;s face shock was evident on them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Little Yue?!&quot; He exclaimed the moment he saw Hui Yue, &quot;is that really you, little Yue?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am sorry sir... I think you might have mistaken me for someone else,&quot; Hui Yue said shocked when he heard this man&apos;s words.</p><p dir="ltr">The man&apos;s eyes turned misty at first, but after a short while he cleared his throat and looked at Hui Yue with a very serious expression.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You say your name is Hui Yue?&quot; He asked, his voice trembling slightly. He was clearly trying to suppress his emotions. As for why, Hui Yue had no idea, but seeing that this was an ancestor, Hui Yue understood that the person on the other side of the communication orb would be able to detect his lies. Therefore, if he needed to lie, his only option was to mix it with the truth.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My name is Hui Yue,&quot; he agreed and nodded his head. After a moment, he added, &quot;I believe my name should be Pei Yue now.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Tell me about your childhood!&quot; He ordered, and although Hui Yue preferred to not speak too much about his childhood, he cleared his throat and quietly retold some of it. &quot;I grew up in a small village with my parents. Both were mortals and neither of them cultivated. When I was ten years old, I joined an academy that taught martial arts, and since then I have walked down the path of being a cultivator.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Lord patriarch assumes that my parents are not my real parents,&quot; Hui Yue continued.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Tell me, do you have any memory before knowing these two mortals?&quot; The ancestor continued to ask, but Hui Yue just shook his head, &quot;I am afraid the only people I remember when I was little are them. I am really not sure what might have happened before then.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see.&quot; The ancestor was quiet for quite some time as he looked at Hui Yue&apos;s face.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let me tell you a story,&quot; the ancestor finally sighed. &quot;Around seventy thousand years ago my wife, Hui Qing, and I, Pei Tian, had a child.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It was not the first child we had, nor was it the last, but he was special.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Every child we had, had the family name Pei as they were members of the Celestial Sword Sect, but this one child, Qing and I decided to secretly name Hui Yue. No one apart from the three of us knew that his name was Hui Yue, and everyone else referred to him as Pei Yue.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He grew up to be incredibly talented. However, one day he vanished.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;When he was fifty years old, he took on a mission outside of the sect, and after that, we never heard anything of him again.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Now, you appear out of nowhere and look exactly like my child except your hair is white whereas his was black. Your name is Hui Yue, and you are a third generation descendant. Tell me, how can you not be my long lost son?&quot; The ancestor with a pained heart asked the completely stunned Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue knew that every reincarnation of his life had the name, Hui Yue. It was clear that the person that this ancestor spoke about was Hui Yue&apos;s previous life.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at this shocked young man, the ancestor could do nothing but shake his head regretfully. Here was the person he was sure was his son, but sadly, he did not remember him. He did not seem to have any memories whatsoever of him nor of the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sir, ancestor,&quot; Hui Yue said quietly. &quot;I am but a new God. I was a mortal at birth, and I am barely thirty years old. How can a thirty years old be connected to someone who went missing seventy thousand years ago?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue felt panicked. He was actually lucky that his previous life had gone missing at such a young age so that no one else remembered him. If the patriarch remembered him, it would have been a real problem.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Hui Yue panicking, the ancestor stopped pressuring him, &quot;I understand. You do not remember anything as you were born a mortal. Tell me, which world were you born in?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pausing for a moment, Hui Yue wondered if he should lie, but then he really didn&#x2019;t know of any other worlds, so lying was not an option.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I was born in the Divine Beast World,&quot; he said honestly, and secretly he was happy that the world was no longer present in the galaxy but was instead within his Universe Box.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Listen, you may not be my son, but you remind me of him. All my children have succumbed to the passage of time so for you to remind me of one of them fills me with happiness. If you need anything use the communication orb I gave you to contact me. I will do my best to help you out if you ever need anything,&quot; the ancestor said, and Hui Yue was quite astonished at this turn of events. He was not really sure how to react to this elderly man or if he would ever need his help, but he bowed to him and offered him his thanks.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The inside of the communication orb turned to mist once more, and the elderly man vanished.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Deep in space was a world bustling with life and on this world was a long, winding mountain range which made up the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s main sect. Deep within this sect were two massive mountains side by side and on top of one of these mountains was ancestor Pei Tian who was seated in a chair as his hands drummed on the table. He was thinking deeply and by his side was another middle-aged man who was looking at him with some pity in his eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Big bro, I know that all your children have already died, and you wish for one of them to have survived, but what the child said makes perfect sense. For him to be your little Yue is not very likely...&quot; the second man said trying to persuade the older man that this couldn&#x2019;t possibly be his son. This man was the second ancestor of the Celestial Sword Sect, someone that Pei Tian had invited over before he started speaking with Hui Yue. He had figured that he wished to have the support of his brother in case he learned something new or just as moral support. This was truly an important matter to Pei Tian.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That... might not necessarily be the case,&quot; Pei Tian said as a smile crept onto his face. &quot;The kid is my son, I can feel it,&quot; he said with confidence.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Brother, you know that a God will not truly die unless their soul is shattered. As long as one&#x2019;s soul is not shattered, it has a chance of being reborn in the circle of reincarnation.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am certain that a miracle must have happened,&quot; he continued; his face was almost manic as he talked, &quot;My son is still alive, and I will be here to protect him! For now, send someone to the Divine Beast World and investigate everyone with the name Hui. I want to know all about his second life!&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
