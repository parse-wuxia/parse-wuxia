Turning around, he rushed back to the Gate of Retribution&#x2019;s headquarters once more.</p><p>&quot;Listen up my fellow cultivators!&quot; he called out loudly the moment he entered, and he quickly became the center of attention. At first many were annoyed when they heard a voice, but as they saw who was speaking, a tremor ran through all the demon hunters present because they realized that this was the leader of the liberators.</p><p>He was currently the cultivator with most contribution points. He had fought the Blood Demons for so long, and killed so many of them, that it was impossible to count exactly how many he had slain. Now that he was calling out, everyone was eager to hear what he had to say.</p><p>&quot;I need the assistance of everyone,&quot; Hui Yue continued, his voice ringing clearly through the entire building. No one spoke, and everyone turned quiet. All of them were staring at Hui Yue unsure of what he wanted.</p><p>&quot;I have taken on a task to get rid of all the supreme human hunting squads. I will deal with every single one of them; however, they are always on the move. I need you to spread the word that I, Pei Yue, of the Celestial Sword Sect, am challenging all the supreme experts from the Blood Demon side to a death match.&quot;</p><p>Hearing his words, Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air, and their eyes widened in shock. Their hearts beat rapidly in the hopes that perhaps these supreme experts, that caused fear in the heart of every expert, would finally be slain. They no longer wanted to fear meeting these deadly generals while out hunting demons.</p><p>Hui Yue was aware that if these supreme experts were killed, then other experts would be sent from their headquarters, but he said nothing. He did not want to discourage everyone.</p><p>&quot;I do not care if they come together or find me one by one,&quot; Hui Yue continued, causing many of the people to gasp. &quot;I will welcome any demon that comes for me. I will slaughter them all one after another and ensure that they can no longer cause problems for us humans again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Spread the word for me. Ensure that you tell every demon that you encounter so that if one of them manages to flee, he can tell the others. I need every Blood Demon to know; I need them to spread the word, and then I will welcome whoever dares to face me. I will kill them one after another and allow for us humans to once again move with our heads held high!&quot;</p><p>The many dumbstruck cultivators were roused from their stupor, their arms were raised into the air, and they all cheered loudly.</p><p>&quot;Well said!&quot; one of them yelled out and the others had smiles all over their faces. Everyone knew that Nightmare had been killed by Hui Yue just recently. Since Hui Yue had been capable of killing supreme experts before, these experts were all sure that he could do it again.</p><p>The bracelet kept track of how many and which Blood Demons were killed and by which cultivator. When one of the Blood Demons worth more contribution points died, the Gate of Retribution would publish the information and use it as propaganda to show the other cultivators that it was indeed not impossible to kill these supreme experts.</p><p>Now certain elite teams were hunting the supreme Blood Demons, but no one had ever before thought of spreading the word that they would challenge all of them to a life and death battle. Even less, no one had the guts to face all of them at once if necessary.</p><p>&quot;We will spread this information as far as we can,&quot; one of the experts promised as he shoved out his chest and hit it with his fist.</p><p>&quot;Do not worry, we will ensure that even the Blood Demon&#x2019;s supreme experts hear of it shortly!&quot; another exclaimed, and soon everyone nodded their heads, agreeing. They would do anything in their power to spread this information as soon as possible and as far as possible.</p><p>&quot;We, the Gate of Retribution, will also spread this information right away,&quot; a manager who descended from the upper levels of their main building said. In his hand was a memory orb, an orb that recorded whatever happened around them.</p><p>&quot;We have sent a copy of this memory orb to every branch of the Gate of Retribution,&quot; the manager said with a smile on his face. &quot;Every hunt squad that enters will be asked to watch this before they are allowed to purchase anything using contribution points.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This way everyone will hear about the challenge, and it is much more likely that the challenge will reach those supreme demons in question.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue had to admit that this was a great help. He smiled as he cupped his hands and bowed to the manager with gratitude. Spreading the recording to every Gate of Retribution branch was definitely the best way to get the information out there, and now all he had to do was to travel around, make his name known, and ensure that the Blood Demons could easily find him.</p><p>He did not doubt for a moment that all of these supreme experts would come searching for him. All of them were proud sons and daughters of the heavens, and cultivators who were used to being feared. To suddenly be challenged in such a bold way was definitely a slap in the face and could not be tolerated.</p><p>If they let Hui Yue go, it would be a great shame to them; they would have no face left. Since this was the case, they would rather risk their lives to prove that they were superior cultivators, that they were above Hui Yue.</p><p>Having bowed one last time to the cultivators within the Gate of Retribution, Hui Yue turned around and left with his friends in tow.</p><p>For the second time that day, he got ready to leave the Gate of Retribution City and the world to start searching for the experts that were as easy to find as a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Behind him, unknown to Hui Yue, the elderly figure was following stealthily behind him, deep in thought.</p><p>He had masked himself so that no one could sense that he was there, and he stayed close enough to be able to hear every word that was said by Hui Yue and his friends, but not close enough for Hui Yue to sense him.</p><p>&quot;He is truly cunning,&quot; the elderly man praised Hui Yue. &quot;To be able to turn the entire western region into your minions and make all of them spread the word of your challenge. If they truly do not show up, then they will have lost all face, and to the demons losing face is the worst possible thing. This is even more true with these favored demons that had been raised with a silverspoon in their mouth.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I initially thought that even though you managed to kill a hundred thousand Blood Demons in a year, this trial would prove to be more of a challenge to you. This is because you needed to locate these supreme demons, but by challenging them like this, I am sure that you will be able to deal with them in half a year at most.&quot;</p><p>The elderly man sighed in praise. &quot;I wish my great-grandson had been as talented as you,&quot; he said with a bit of lamenting in his voice, but he shook his head and quickly pushed the thoughts of his dear great-grandson away.</p><p>Although he loved him, and although he still grieved his loss, he understood that sometimes death was deserved, and this certainly was one of those cases. Not to mention this young man was truly a dragon amongst men. To have died to his hand was no shame.</p><p>Hui Yue did not know about the complex thoughts that surfaced in the mind of the elder; he did not even know that the elder had followed him, and instead, he was just preparing his shuttle to leisurely make his way through the western region.</p><p>He could not do much about searching for the demons, so all he could do was to make his presence known.</p><p>They continued to hunt the Blood Demons down in the hopes that they would come across their targets by luck, but even after a month had gone past, they had not seen even the shadow of their targets.</p><p>Though, they did notice that their strategy was the correct one. At first, the Blood Demons had seemed oblivious to the challenge he sent out, but as time went by more and more started to talk about Hui Yue being that insane challenger.</p><p>Some of them were filled with arrogance and believed that this human who had challenged all their supreme hunters would soon be killed horribly, and thus their sacrifice would be avenged, while others were on the verge of collapsing from realizing whom they had been caught by.</p><p>The elder was surprised to see how Hui Yue&apos;s team were handling the killings. Now that Hui Yue did not have to deal with the hundred thousand experts he left all the killing to his friends.</p><p>They were weaker than Hui Yue, but they all had their strengths and tricks. They could easily manage the demons, and they gained more battle experience this way.</p><p>As they made their way deeper and deeper into the western regions once more, they also came across more and more human squads that were hunting Blood Demons.</p><p>Each and every one of them looked at Hui Yue with reverence, and some of them even went on board Hui Yue&apos;s shuttle to tell him all they knew about the locations of the supreme Blood Demons.</p><p>Some of them would talk about the location where other humans had gone missing, and they were proud to say that they even allowed some Blood Demons to escape for the sake of spreading the challenge to the demons.</p><p>Hui Yue was stunned when he heard that they had intentionally let Blood Demons roam free, but quickly a wry smile spread on his face. He had not expected that humanity would be this invigorated because of a challenge he had sent out.</p><p>Truthfully, it was not only him, but also the elder was deeply shocked. He never expected that the trials he had set up on the spur of the moment could bring such a boost to the morale of their forces.</p><p>As they made their way forward more and more Blood Demons came to challenge Hui Yue of their volition. They had heard about his challenge and wished to prove to him that they were at least as strong as he was and that their supreme experts were not needed.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of them were able to force Hui Yue to make a move. They were all dealt with by his friends as he just sat unmoving on the shuttle with a faint smile on his lips. He could already tell the outcome of these fights.</p><p>Days passed by and so did the months slowly causing Hui Yue to start feeling worried. He had been searching all this time, but he had found none of his targets. None of them had come to challenge him either... Was there possibly something wrong with his plan?</p><p>He sighed deeply, but just as this thought occurred in his mind, he frowned. In front of him, he could see a small army coming his way. This army was quite different from the last one he had fought, different from the time that demon used a world ending bead.</p><p>There was a savage air around them, a savage atmosphere, and finally a killing intent that seemed to shake the void. It was clear that this was a group of experts that were a cut above the rest.</p><p>As Hui Yue sensed them coming, a smile finally surfaced on his face, &quot;Finally, they are here!&quot; he exclaimed as he packed away his shuttle.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
