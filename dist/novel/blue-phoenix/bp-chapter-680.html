Her hands were tightly clasped in front of her chest, and her eyes were moist. She was thinking about all the things she had experienced together with the Alchemist God, and she could not help but feel excited about meeting him again.</p><p>Little Green and Hui Yue were not the only ones who were nervous. Huli was also feeling slightly worried. She had been tasked with looking after one of the Alchemist God&apos;s disciples, but in the end, he had ultimately perished.</p><p>Although she had stayed by his side in his grave for many many years after his death, Huli could not help but feel guilty that the expert died in the first place.</p><p>&quot;But if he had not died like this I would have never found Yue,&quot; she mumbled to herself, her voice so low that no one could hear her. Having thought this, she felt a little calmer.</p><p>The rest were also nervous, especially Jo and Lao. They had not spent a long time with Wang Ju Long, but the time they had spent with her was irreplaceable. She made them feel what it was like to have a mother&apos;s love and affection and this was something they yearned to have once more. Even now after many years had passed by, they were still waiting for their mother to return to them.</p><p>Sha Yun was doing her best to look after them, but she was more of an aunt than a mother. She cared for them, and she saw them as her family, but she was not capable of giving them the warmth of a mother.</p><p>Slowly, they all entered into the timeworn sect. The buildings in the sect were on the verge of collapsing; the pavement was filled with cracks from the herbs and grasses that had sprouted through the many streets.</p><p>An eerie silence was present within the sect, and the only sound one could hear was the wind caught between the buildings.</p><p>The further into the sect they went, the more confused they became. There were no signs of any humans anywhere, no signs of living beings.</p><p>They entered every single building. The first building they saw was a dining hall filled with benches and tables, but a thick layer of dust showed that it had not been used for a very long time.</p><p>Another building was the martial arts hall. It was filled with countless books about Ancestral Worldpower skills. So many skills were present that were split up into different categories.</p><p>Waving his hand, Hui Yue stored all of them in his Universe Box, &quot;When we return we will split all the loot equally between us, but since my storage treasure is the biggest, I will pick it all up now.&quot; Hui Yue announced.</p><p>He knew that no one would expect that he was taking the things just for himself, but he still wished to explain to the others. He did not want to steal their treasures.</p><p>They also went towards another building which proved to be the pill pavilion. It was filled with pills of various kinds, and all of the pills in the pavilion were incredibly pure.</p><p>The purer a pill was, the less scent that would be released from it as all the medicinal properties would stay within the pill. Pills that were made by someone unskilled would constantly leak some of the medicinal properties, and hence the scent of them would be stronger.</p><p>In this pill pavilion, they found mountains of pills with almost no scent. This meant that they had either lost all the medicinal properties that were within them, or they were of very high purity.</p><p>Now was not the time to test the purity of these pills, so Hui Yue just waved his hand and once more absorbed all the items into his Universe Box.</p><p>After the pill pavilion, the dining hall, and the martial arts hall they entered the main building of the sect. This place was filled with treasures, and they also found the treasury beneath this building. Once again, Hui Yue decided to take everything they came across. The things they could not use could always be sold for worldpower stones when they returned to the Blissful Realm.</p><p>This realm seemed deserted. It seemed as if no one had ever been here before because all the things from when the sect was still present were still around. No one had taken any of the treasures before, and because of this, there were treasures everywhere for them to find.</p><p>They found multiple precious metals and alloys, figures, paintings, statues, gems, jewelry, and anything that one could imagine sitting around randomly throughout the many buildings they explored.</p><p>In the treasury, they found armors and weapons alongside even more jewelry and precious items.</p><p>Although they found treasures everywhere, they were not able to find any traces of life, and the more they looked, the more uncomfortable Hui Yue became. Was this not the world he had been looking for?</p><p>Was the Alchemist God perhaps living in another part of the world and not here in this desolate old sect?</p><p>Perhaps he had died? He did suffer from injuries before and even though he was an immortal god, if he suffered from severe injuries to his soul then he was likely to have succumbed.</p><p>&quot;But it was only five hundred to a thousand years since that ghost saw him...&quot; Little Green&apos;s voice came from the side as if to answer Hui Yue&apos;s own thoughts and he nodded his head. Even if he had been injured, it should not be so bad that he would have died after a mere thousand years. As far as he had understood his injuries had been present for a long time, but he had been able to prevail in the face of the pain.</p><p>Hui Yue was doubtful, but he did not want to give up the hope he harbored. He continued forward and kept exploring the sect. He went on to the residential area where many people would have been living back when humans still inhabited the world.</p><p>As they reached the place where the residential houses were located, everyone was stunned. They expected it to be similar to the other places, completely worn down and about to collapse, but when they looked at the area, it was neat and in great shape.</p><p>It was clear that someone was keeping it in order, that someone was cleaning all the houses and making them appear pristine.</p><p>&quot;That is quite a contrast,&quot; Xiao She said surprised as she looked at the surroundings that spread out in front of them. Her eyes were wide open, and everyone else had shocked expressions on their faces.</p><p>&quot;He might really be here,&quot; Hui Yue and Little Green said at the same time, their faces beaming with hope and expectations.</p><p>Looking at each other, they laughed and started moving faster inside the residential area. They checked every single house and found that the majority of them were empty, but well looked after.</p><p>The deeper into the residential area they went, the more the houses seemed like someone lived inside of them or used them frequently. The gardens around the houses were all well maintained, and the houses showed no signs of decay.</p><p>&quot;Oh we have guests,&quot; a soft voice suddenly sounded from one of the houses, and everyone stopped in their tracks. Their senses on high alert and all of them were unsure of what exactly they should do.</p><p>No one had sensed this person that suddenly spoke, not even Pei Ziqi or Hui Yue. He had appeared out of nowhere. He stood just in front of them on the road, a middle-aged man wearing green clothes that had an amiable smile on his face.</p><p>When he looked at them, there was a gentle light in his eyes until it landed on Little Green after which his face distorted into a shocked expression, and he suddenly backed away.</p><p>&quot;Little Green?!&quot; he exclaimed. His previous stoic and incredibly calm appearance crumbled as he looked at the young-looking sylph by Hui Yue&apos;s side, and when the eyes roamed over the rest of the group, his eyes grew even larger as he shook his head, &quot;Huli, you are here too?&quot; he asked.</p><p>&quot;This is truly unexpected,&quot; he said in a voice thick with emotions. &quot;Follow me.&quot;</p><p>The man, who had just been severely shocked managed to calm himself very fast, and he turned around to leave, his arms clasped at his back and his steps calm and steady.</p><p>Hui Yue observed the man in front of him, and he was filled with a feeling of incredibility. This man was a real expert. He had an aura that made him feel similar to when he met Yama, the true King of Hell. It was simply impossible to see through this man.</p><p>No one spoke, and everyone was on high alert as they followed the middle-aged man who reached a house and let them inside.</p><p>This was the largest of the houses in the residential area, and it had its own courtyard. It was two stories and looked as if it could belong to any sect at any time. In this house, there were no signs of decay and the passage of time like everywhere else in the sect.</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;m back, and I brought some guests with me,&quot; the middle-aged man said with a loud voice, after which one could hear someone scramble upstairs.</p><p>Clattering sounds as if someone fell from the bed could be heard, and soon sounds of someone rushing down the stairs followed before a small child appeared in front of them.</p><p>This young child was adorable. He had blue eyes, golden hair, and fair skin like moonlight.</p><p>His eyes were open wide, and a brilliant smile appeared on his face displaying his beautiful white teeth.</p><p>&quot;This is Xiao Hui, a sentient medicinal pill.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hui? What a coincidence, my name is Hui Yue,&quot; Hui Yue said introducing himself. Although he went by the name Pei Yue recently, he did not hesitate to say his true name to these two experts in front of him. He could sense that if he lied and said Pei Yue, the Alchemist God would instantly sense that something was wrong.</p><p>&quot;I also go by the name Pei Yue as I happen to have a relationship with the Celestial Sword Sect.&quot; He continued his introduction.</p><p>The Alchemist God listened interested to his introduction and nodded his head.</p><p>&quot;I assume you came all the way here to find me since you managed to bring Little Green with you,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;And it seems that little Huli follows you so obediently. I only know one person who could ever make her follow him. Coincidentally his name was also Hui Yue, could it be that the one who died so tragically that year did not really die?&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue shook his head. &quot;I am him, but at the same time not,&quot; he said hesitantly not sure if he should say too much, but then he looked at the Alchemist God and realized that this was an expert who could kill him in an instant if he so desired. If he had any hostile intentions, then he would have been already dead.</p><p>&quot;I am fortunate that I was resurrected by a phoenix. I am slowly connecting with my previous lives, and one of them happens to be the Hui Yue that you know of.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Interesting... How very interesting,&quot; The Alchemist God said while rubbing his chin and looking at Hui Yue with a gleam in his eyes.</p><p>&quot;I feel like I know so much about you! The Hui Yue from back then, Huli would never stop talking about him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And now you have done me a favor and brought Little Green here. I am truly grateful so tell me, why are you looking for me?&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
