Although Pei Feng behaved well and did not seek revenge for Pei Chen when he was introduced to Hui Yue, there was something about this person that made Hui Yue feel uncomfortable.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at Pei Ze, Hui Yue found that he had an expression similar to his own, and after a moment, the eyes of the two met. Pei Ze just smiled and shook his head. This was not the place to talk.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Casually talking with the experts at the sparring field for a bit, Pei Ze was the perfect host and introduced Hui Yue a little more intimately to the experts of the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They stayed at the sparring field for a good hour before Pei Ze finally excused them and they started to tour the mansion.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After they were far enough away from the sparring field, and other experts, Pei Ze finally stopped and turned to look at Hui Yue with mixed emotions on his face.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I need to speak with you about Pei Feng, but I fear you might misunderstand,&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;What I say now may make it seem like I am disparaging Pei Feng, but it&apos;s simply the truth as Pei Feng is a little too ruthless when he handles matters.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although you have no problem with Pei Feng himself right now, you have some disagreements with Pei Chen, one of Pei Feng&apos;s subordinates. Since it&#x2019;s like this, he already knows that it will be hard to resolve the differences, and thus, he will come up with another way to ensure that you will not affect his plans. He can be quite nasty and ruthless, more than a few people have lost their lives from being in the way.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who already had a bad impression of Pei Feng was even more alarmed hearing this. It seemed that although they were not allowed to kill fellow sect members some people still did so secretly.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, killing you will not be easy considering your status within the sect, but I assume that he will make a move during the trials now that he knows you will participate in them.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He usually puts the blame on other members of the family or outsiders. Usually, it&#x2019;s members of the sect that are also in his way, so it is likely I would get blamed for your death. Even if we don&#x2019;t help each other out in the future, do what you can to take care of yourself. Not only am I rather impressed by your performance, and want to know just what heights you can reach, but I also think that as long as you survive, then I will have a shot at becoming the new sect leader.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was rather surprised when he heard the honesty in Pei Ze&apos;s voice. Pei Ze was clearly a high-ranked member of the younger generation of the Celestial Sword Sect, and it was rare for him to be friendly with anyone. Usually, there was distance between him and everyone else, but the friendliness he showed Hui Yue made him feel welcomed to the sect.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have some things I need to do,&quot; Hui Yue said, &quot;I need to become the Judge of Hell, and after that, I need some time to travel the galaxy. If it makes any difference, then I don&#x2019;t mind helping you out occasionally. You are the reason I was able to enter the Celestial Sword Sect, and you have treated me with sincerity. I will not be spending much time in the Celestial Sword Sect, but if my word carries any weight, then I will say that I support you as many times as needed.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although it might seem like a hasty decision, Hui Yue did not need to think much about his choice. He was a member of the younger generation, and at some point, he had to choose between Pei Ze and Pei Feng.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at these two it was obvious that Hui Yue would not choose Pei Feng. A person who already gave him a bad impression and made him feel uncomfortable. Pei Ze had done a lot for Hui Yue already, and he gave him a comfortable feeling, therefore, the decision was not hard. Making it sooner rather than later was for the best.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing Hui Yue&apos;s words, Pei Ze&apos;s expression went from cautious to excited. His eyebrows rose in surprise, and his eyes sparkled. Even a smile crept onto his lips, and he could almost not believe the words Hui Yue had said. Although he had to choose at some point, most experts would wait and see who would offer them the most benefits first. Hui Yue had completely ignored any kind of reward he might be able to get and instead he made his decision very suddenly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is great!&quot; Pei Ze exclaimed with excitement and clasped Hui Yue&apos;s shoulder. &quot;You made the best decision! If you are in need of cultivation resources, just come find me. I will do what I can to provide them for you,&quot; he said. &quot;But first, let&#x2019;s continue the tour of the premises so that you know where everything is.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Pei Ze seemed to be treating Hui Yue slightly different than most of his other allies, Hui Yue was quite amazed at how good Pei Ze was at planning things. Within moments he had managed to find the most suitable direction around the mansion so that the most important places were visited first.</p><p dir="ltr">They visited the medicinal garden where one could buy medicinal herbs. The sect had a variety of herbs for sale that had amazing healing properties, and even some that had soul strengthening properties that increased one&#x2019;s Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p dir="ltr">After visiting the medicinal garden, they entered the skills pavilion. It was a small pavilion where all the skills that the Youdu branch possessed were stored. This pavilion consisted of different levels. On the first level, any member of the Celestial Sword Sect could enter and learn the Ancestral Worldpower skills inside.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The second level one could only enter if they had made a big contribution to the sect, and the final level was the hardest to enter; one could only enter if they had a head elder&#x2019;s permission.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The skills were all Ancestral Worldpower skills, and although they were all weaker than using the dao to fight, these Ancestral Worldpower skills were copies of daos and could be trained much easier than one could comprehend a dao. For this reason, many young Gods chose to learn Ancestral Worldpower skills before they started to comprehend the dao.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had already comprehended two complete daos and was close to comprehending the dao of the sword as well. He was not in need of these Ancestral Worldpower skills.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;A few Ancestral Worldpower skills are as powerful as a dao attack, but all these skills are at the main sect, and one needs to do something quite outstanding for the sect to be allowed to learn them. So far only a handful of experts, apart from the elders, have been allowed to learn them. The harder the skill, the more challenging it is to train in. Not many can succeed in learning these high-level skills. Even I have never been allowed to the third floor of any of the skill pavilions in either the main sect or the branch sects.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was secretly astounded. Pei Ze was known as the most outstanding genius in the younger generation, only threatened by Pei Feng, and even he had not been given access to these abilities... Just what would one have to do to get access to those skills?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These skills that were as strong as comprehending an entire dao path were simply too powerful for normal Gods to attempt to learn which was the reason the sect rarely let their disciples study them. Due to the power and dangers they involved, Hui Yue understood why the sect would safeguard them. Normally it would take quite a while for an expert to comprehend a full dao path and use it in combat, but there were some Ancestral Worldpower skills which were as powerful as a full dao path! They were easier to learn than a full dao path, and thus, were sought after by everyone. Even large sects like the Celestial Sword Sect were eager to get their hands on even more of these skills.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh well, considering how little I will be in the Celestial Sword Sect, I doubt I will ever make enough contributions to even visit the second level of the skills pavilion,&quot; Hui Yue laughed uncaringly. Although Ancestral Worldpower skills were interesting and tempting to Hui Yue, the speed he had used to comprehend daos was so outstanding that it might not be faster for him to train in these Ancestral Worldpower skills.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Hui Yue not show any greed towards these Ancestral Worldpower skills, even after hearing how amazing they were, Pei Ze was rather shocked.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Tell me. As you&apos;re a new God, how can your first dao be the dao of space? As far as I know, it is one of the most challenging daos to master. I would have started with the dao of the sword or a dao of similar difficulty.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue could feel that Pei Ze was truly looking out for him, and he just smiled, &quot;The dao of space is not the only dao I know,&quot; he answered honestly. &quot;Although I will not to tell you exactly how many daos I have comprehended and what they are, I can say that I have faith in my own ability to fight Pei Feng. Even without the use of my Celestial Sword Sect&#x2019;s wings.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze was at first shocked when he heard that Hui Yue had some degree of faith in himself, but after that, he started laughing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are considering the wings of the great roc to be the Celestial Sword Sect&#x2019;s?&quot; He asked with laughter in his voice as he shook his head, &quot;Sorry, I keep forgetting that you did not grow up in our sect.&quot; Musing for a short while he looked at Hui Yue and started circling him, looking at him from every single angle.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;To be honest, you have never actually learned anything about our sect right?&quot; He asked shocked as it dawned upon him that Hui Yue was actually a new God from a small world; a world that never heard about the Celestial Sword Sect before.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The more he looked at Hui Yue, the greater his smile became and finally he stopped circling him and shook his head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I&#x2019;ll tell you. You need to learn more than what the Fu brothers taught you on the way here,&quot; he said.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Come with me, let&#x2019;s go to our rooms. I will show you which room belongs to you and then we will start the lessons. The more you understand, the more you will be able to use the power of our sect to your own advantage.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Having said that a childish smile was evident on the face of Pei Ze as he led the way for Hui Yue to their room. Hui Yue was quite surprised when he noticed the childish smile on Pei Ze&apos;s face, and he could not help but chuckle himself. With a glance at Huli, who was seemingly oblivious to everything that had happened, Hui Yue decided to follow Pei Ze and hear what he had to say.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
