Lu Jing, Mu Haolong, and Jo were the ones who were the most injured. Lu Jing, the three-headed dog, had gotten a large wound on his chest from a saber-wielding Immortal of Creation.</p><p>Mu Haolong had almost lost an arm, but he had been fast and consumed some medicinal pills that Hui Yue had concocted for him, and it had regrown almost instantly, leaving no issues behind.</p><p>Jo was always the one who faced her opponents face to face, and although she had been capable of avoiding the majority of the attacks, a few had grazed her. They caused cuts and bruises to appear all over her body.</p><p>Apart from these three, others also had shallow cuts and bruises. Their clothes were in disarray from the massive amounts of energy that was constantly going off on the battlefield, but even so, everyone had shining eyes.</p><p>Every time someone lost their lives or sustained heavy injuries the victor would claim their storage treasures before their bodies floated off into the endless abyss that spread out before them.</p><p>Everyone who was watching felt their scalps grow numb. Although this group of experts were not all Immortals of Creation, they were clearly decimating this group of twenty Immortals of Creation; they slaughtered them with impunity.</p><p>Those who had not lost their lives had lost their storage treasures and were fleeing from these monsters they had encountered. Even the previously domineering leader had given up all thoughts of revenge as he fled for his life cursing himself and his arrogance.</p><p>His group and even he, himself, had sought treasure in the Archaic World for a long time, and they had done well. They had robbed other cultivators and found treasures here and there. So far they had never met a true unbeatable enemy, yet today all of that changed. Within a very short amount of time, his entire group had been utterly devastated, and the survivors were likely not going to group up together once more. They simply did not have the face to meet each other again.</p><p>The Archaic World was a place where dragons and snakes colluded together, and death was an everyday occurrence.</p><p>Although many died because of the dangers within the worlds, the fierce beasts, and the strange natural phenomenon, the deaths within the Archaic world were not only caused by just this many were also killed by other cultivators. This was the main reason why the survival rate was as low as it was.</p><p>&quot;We can&apos;t stay here,&quot; Hui Yue called out, and everyone gathered around him as he waved his hand and the ship-like shuttle appeared in front of them.</p><p>All of them boarded the shuttle, and then they moved towards the next world that Hui Yue had placed his focus on.</p><p>This world was also on the outer perimeter of the Archaic World. He stayed away from the Translucent Forest, the Immortal Valley, and the Ruins as he knew that they were not the right worlds for them to enter.</p><p>Because of this, they decided to move further into the Archaic World, Although it would become more and more dangerous, he also knew that it was their only chance. He would face death and brace for any danger that came their way.</p><p>The further inwards they headed the more unstable the realms and worlds they saw and visited became. This time Hui Yue also noticed something of great benefit from the worlds that were close to collapsing.</p><p>When a world was about to collapse the surrounding protective layers would crack making it possible to look into the world or realm beneath.</p><p>Since he could glance into the world beneath when it was close to collapsing, he could determine if it was the world they were looking for or not.</p><p>Though for some worlds it was impossible to see what was hidden beneath the protective layers, and they went into these worlds one after another.</p><p>One of the worlds they entered was like any other world, but it was just eerily void of humans. There were signs of villages, large cities, and other fortresses, but all of them had decayed with the passing of time, and no humans lived here now. Now, only fierce beasts had survived the eras and the world&#x2019;s chaotic movements through the Archaic World.</p><p>Another world that they entered was like a land of angels. There were four suns surrounding it and not a cloud in the sky to hinder the light bathing everything in a gentle and warm light.</p><p>This world had no signs of human interference, everything seemed to be a part of nature, and they even saw natural spirits playing around in a forest close to where they arrived.</p><p>Another world was filled with massive insects. These were fierce beasts, but all the ones that had survived were of the insect type. Their size was so overwhelmingly large and looking at all those insects; everyone felt nauseous. This was a world no one wished to stay in for long.</p><p>The further into the Archaic World they went, the stranger the creatures they met were.</p><p>They saw beasts that were half humans half beasts, and they also saw nymphs and spirits as well. They saw ghosts and even sentient trees and stones were living well in these worlds.</p><p>As they made their way further into the Archaic World, they were met with fewer and fewer cultivators. There were still some that dared venture to the edges of the outer perimeter, but no one wished to enter into the middle area.</p><p>Especially now that a tidal wave had appeared and new worlds had arrived, no one felt the need to enter the middle area, but Hui Yue was different.</p><p>The group spent a whole year traveling in the outer perimeter, and entering one world after another. At the start, they had been the target of quite a few bandits, but as they traveled from world to world their name started to spread throughout the entire outer perimeter of the Archaic World.</p><p>To be honest, the main reason they had become famous was because of Pei Ziqi. Every time a fight occurred, Pei Ziqi would throw herself into it and go all out to kill as many enemies as she possibly could. This often ended with her clearing out the entire bandit group.</p><p>Another name from their group which had started to resound throughout the Archaic World was Xiao Ning. His defense was becoming famous as he had been able to withstand hits from Immortals of Creation without breaking a sweat or being forced to step back.</p><p>Jo was getting famous for her reckless and messy fighting style that completely depended on close quarters combat.</p><p>Even Wan Qiao and Huli were getting famous within the Archaic World. However, their fame was due to their beauty. They had been given the titles of the most beautiful goddesses within the Archaic World, much to the dismay of both Sha Yun and Xiao She.</p><p>During this one year, Hui Yue had not participated much in the fights, but had left the task to the others who had gained great benefits from the constant battles.</p><p>Some of them had gained breakthroughs in the dao while others became more proficient in fighting, but all of them had benefitted. Their wealth had also grown quite a bit as they would rob anyone that got in their way.</p><p>Their names shook the Archaic World, and although they might not be the strongest group around, everyone understood that this group was not to be insulted.</p><p>Those with a better cultivation base that watched their fights could see that there were at least four extreme experts that had yet to make their move, Cai Jie, Hui Yue, Wei, and Huli, rarely participated in the fights. They really had no reason to do so as Pei Ziqi was like a battle god that had descended from the heavens above to pass judgment on all evildoers.</p><p>Everyone knew that this group of experts was headed deeper and deeper into the Archaic World, and some even followed them to see what their aim was.</p><p>Had they gotten news of some sort of treasure that had appeared after the tidal wave? Had they seen a special world they wished to enter? No one knew, but when someone followed them, they found that this group entered every single stable world.</p><p>Their advance was slow, and they did not seem to care at all for the fame that they had gained in the Archaic World. The other cultivators never found out what exactly they were after, and they kept entering and exiting worlds quickly one after another.</p><p>What puzzled everyone was that as soon as they entered a world, they would look for the way to leave it again. They would not hunt fierce beasts, they would not look for treasure, and they would not even pay attention to the danger zones that everyone else sought out.</p><p>Because of their odd behavior, some of the powerhouses of the Ancient World started paying attention to the group, but even these powerhouses viewed them with caution.</p><p>If they had a true way to measure the strength of the entire group they might have sprung into action and captured some of the weaker experts to interrogate them, however, seeing Pei Ziqi&apos;s display of strength, none of them were certain that they would be able to survive a fight with them.</p><p>Especially not if they had to bring Hui Yue and the other experts of the group who had not shown their strength into account.</p><p>The first year and a half within the Archaic World had been spent trapped within the first world they had entered, and the following year had been spent traveling from world to world, experiencing a myriad of cultures, beasts, and environments.</p><p>After these two and a half years they had finally reached the border between the outer perimeter and the middle region of the Archaic World.</p><p>Everyone held their breath as they stood side by side and looked at this middle area.</p><p>Everything looked the same. There was no line stating that one would go from area to another, except the closer Hui Yue came, the more he sensed that the Ancestral Worldpower in the middle region was even denser than outside.</p><p>Moving into the middle region it felt like they were submerged in water. The Ancestral Worldpower in the air was so dense that it almost the same as being in water, and Hui Yue could feel how his body was constantly being refined because of this. It was as if his body had become a black hole, constantly sucking in the energy from the void and refining it much faster than before.</p><p>Since the air was so much denser because of the Ancestral Worldpower, it was also harder to move through the void here. This meant that if they met a fierce beast, their reaction would be slower as they were still not used to this new pressure.</p><p>Even the beasts which in the past did not cause too many problems could now devastate their group if they were not careful and Hui Yue&apos;s face turned serious. It seemed that there really was a reason as to why ninety percent of the people who entered the middle regions died.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Hui Yue turned to look at his friends. What he had thought about had already passed through the other&apos;s minds as well, but no one looked at him with worry in their eyes. All were supportive and even excited.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; Yan Lei spoke with his deep melodious voice, &quot;Although we know the dangers, we are right behind you. Let us enter the middle regions of the Archaic World!&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
