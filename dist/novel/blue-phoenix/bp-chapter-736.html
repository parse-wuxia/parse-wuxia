Surnamed Pei...&quot; the master hesitated slightly as he heard this and rubbed his chin. He knew that the ones surnamed Pei were from the Celestial Sword Sect, but he had never before heard of this Pei Yue.</p><p>&quot;Tell me some more about him, especially if you know about his strength,&quot; the master said with a friendly voice. He flicked his hand, and a bag of Worldpower Stones appeared in his palm.</p><p>The random travelers who had been stopped by this unfathomably powerful master gulped in unison. The bag in his palm seemed quite heavy; there ought to be at least a thousand Worldpower Stones within. Such wealth was not easy to come across without endangering one&#x2019;s life.</p><p>&quot;Good Sir, I will tell you everything I know,&quot; said one of the men instantly. Although he was blinded by the Worldpower Stones, he understood that if he wanted to earn these stones, then he had to provide some useful information to the man.</p><p>&quot;I only know the rumors that go around about him, but these rumors are rather exaggerated,&quot; the man started. &quot;Pei Yue is a member of the Celestial Sword Sect. He is a third generation disciple and the son of Pei Tian.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Although he is a third generation descendant, he also happens to be very young. No one knows exactly how young he is, but he is recognized as the number one supreme expert of the younger generation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He has the complete support of Diyu as he was a for a time the Judge of Hell while King Chujiang had died. He took over his tasks and ran his court in hell. It is said he played a vital role in restoring King Chujiang&#x2019;s life, and that although he is no longer a king of one of the Ten Courts of Hell, he is still considered a Judge of Hell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not only this, he has beaten the previously number one genius of the younger generation from the Nightcrawler&apos;s sect many times.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are some rumors going around that he has some sort of relationship with the Alchemist God since he is using a refined body and so do all of his companions. Some even speculate that he is the legacy apprentice of the Alchemist God since he is capable of providing refined bodies to all his friends.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He seems to have some blood feud with the Blood Demons as well because he is currently slaughtering them whenever he sees them. He has liberated many worlds within the western region, killed Blood Demon after Blood Demon, and also destroyed any strongholds he has come across.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No one knows his exact strength, but he has at least comprehended four major daos, and he uses a very valuable sword.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He is currently on good terms with the Ling family in the world belonging to the Gate of Retribution. He has been with them for a year already, and I imagine that he would have returned there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;His group consists of quite a few people. They are a mix of magical beasts and humans, and there are no spirits or demons amongst them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We don&apos;t know much about them, except that some of them are equal to supreme experts while others are a bit weaker. All of them are Immortals of Creation, and they have all at least comprehended one major dao.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only one of the members of the group is known to us, and that is the Western Tiger. She is a rather famous mercenary from our western region but as for how she came to become part of this group no one knows.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Many young experts from the western region have tried to become a member of their team, but all of them were refused. It does not matter how talented they are or how strong their combat-ability is, all of them, without mistake, have been turned down.&quot;</p><p>The master&apos;s face was glum, but he nodded his head, &quot;Thank you for telling me this much.&quot; He said politely as he threw the bag of Worldpower Stones towards the expert and turned around before he vanished.</p><p>&quot;This is troublesome,&quot; The master thought out loud to himself as he flew through the vast void. &quot;I know my beloved great-grandson well. He was arrogant beyond belief. It might have been my mistake for spoiling him too much, but he was indeed talented... He was the most talented within my entire family, and he had the ability to one day comprehend a heavenly dao.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Although it would have been impossible for him to ever become an Overlord, or even a half-step Overlord, it is already very good to be able to comprehend a heavenly dao. He would have been able to live a comfortable life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why did he have to go and insult some supreme genius from a major sect? Although I am strong, I cannot easily act against this Pei Yue.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I do not fear the major sects retaliation alone, but if they know I am still alive, they can easily find my family. If I do not do anything to their genius descendant, then they will leave my family be, but if I harm him, it is clear that they will try to kill all the ones I hold dear. Although I can flee them, I will not be able to save my loved ones at the same time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even if I want revenge, I need to think very carefully about it first so that no one can trace it back to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Those old foggies from the Celestial Sword Sect are not easy to deal with on their own, and that old sly fox Pei Tian is his father. Who would have thought that he was still able to father children now he is practically in his grave.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not to mention that he is also considered a member of Diyu. If I find the three old parrots from the Celestial Sword Sect annoying, then that is nothing compared to Yanluo, that old goat. He is truly annoying and even worse Yama is backing him.&quot;</p><p>When he said this name, his body shuddered. Although he believed he could run from the men from the Celestial Sword Sect and also favored his chances of survival against Yanluo, he knew that if Yama came to get him, then he had absolutely no chance of surviving.</p><p>&quot;Not to mention now is not a good time. I fought in the last war against the Blood Demons, and if this ends up as serious as the last war, then I will be forced to lend all my strength to our side again. Although I hate this Pei Yue to the bones, I cannot betray humanity.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well first, let&#x2019;s hurry towards the Ling family. Even if I hate this child, I need to at least meet him in person.&quot;</p><p>Having said this, the old Master flew towards the Ling family mansion with a face darker than thundercloud and his grievances buried deep in his heart.</p><p>If there was no family to take into account, and no war happening, then he would without a doubt kill Hui Yue the moment he saw him, but circumstances were different. There were quite a few things to take into account, and he could only swallow his hatred for now.</p><p>A few days went by while the master flew at his fastest speed rushing towards the world belonging to the Gate of Retribution.</p><p>During this time, Hui Yue was deep in meditation. He understood that the dao could be used in different ways. Daos of the same origin could be merged together and slowly evolve into major daos. However the major daos were incapable of being merged, what they could do was be superimposed on each other.</p><p>Superimposing of a dao sounded much easier than it was. These daos were not something tangible. They were energy waves and manifestation of a phenomenon.</p><p>They were able to draw on the Ancestral Worldpower in the surroundings and manifest the element that they consisted of, that being either metal, fire, water, wind, and so on.</p><p>These daos were the purest kind of energy, a spark that controlled the elements. Therefore to superimpose daos, one had to find the core of these energies. One had to find the spark itself, the energy that created the various elements; one had to find the base of the element itself.</p><p>This meant that one had to have a full and comprehensive understanding of the dao one used.</p><p>There were various levels of comprehending a major dao. One was the rudimentary level. The level where one had just comprehended the dao and was capable of using the major dao to form attacks. This let them manifest the element in battle.</p><p>Then there was the advanced level, where one was able to use the element or dao together with another dao. This was not superimposing, but the ability to almost dual-control the two daos.</p><p>Finally, there was the mastered level where one would be able to fully understand the dao they were using. One could use the dao as a way to manifest an element. One could use the dao to create energy layers of the core energy that was known as the spark, and use it in even more marvelous ways to do battle.</p><p>It was not until now that Hui Yue understood that this was what Pei Ziqi had been doing the entire time. Although it seemed as if her attacks were devoid of the dao, she had always compressed the dao to its most fundamental stage and layered it around herself and her weapon.</p><p>Not only could it protect her, but it also greatly enhanced her strength. Not to mention that the spark was still present, it still controlled the dao and was able to penetrate almost any defense. It was able to break through mountains like a hot knife through butter and thus easily slice through a human&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Hui Yue was sitting with the Celestial Sword in his hands, and he could feel that his comprehension of the daos was now much faster than ever before.</p><p>The depth of his understanding of the daos was constantly evolving. Before this, he had gained sudden enlightenment and was able to superimpose the daos, but it was not before now that he understood the profound meaning behind superimposing the daos.</p><p>He understood the concept of everything returning to nothing. Compressing the dao would make this much more usable in combat, his attacks would be much more explosive and dangerous, volatile and hard to control.</p><p>Upon touching something, this volatile energy would explode outwards and annihilate the target. This was because the spark and core of the dao had been compressed.</p><p>Just as Hui Yue had gained enlightenment, he frowned. A strong presence was rushing towards the Ling family mansion, and Hui Yue hurried to hide the Celestial Sword within the Universe Box.</p><p>He understood that although he could hide it from most powerhouses, some would be able to sense it, and considering that he could feel this powerhouse rushing towards them, he was in no way inferior to the strongest experts that Hui Yue had seen before.</p><p>A somber expression appeared on his face. Had this expert sensed the Celestial Sword or the Universe Box? Was this the reason for him to come rushing, or was it something else?</p><p>Hui Yue simply had no idea, but he was ever so cautious as he exited his chamber where he had been cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>&quot;Young Master Pei, I thought you were in seclusion?&quot; the steward of the mansion came walking past the chamber by coincidence, and he was surprised to see that Hui Yue had emerged. He was even more surprised when he saw a serious expression on the face of the young man.</p><p>&quot;Go tell the prominent figures that we will be having an important guest coming soon. And hurry,&quot; Hui Yue urged the steward who was completely confused, but he quickly bowed and retreated backwards, turning to inform the masters of the Ling family.</p><p>&quot;Let us hope he is here with friendly intentions,&quot; Hui Yue muttered to himself as he went to gather his friends.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
