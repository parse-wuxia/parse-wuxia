They all just observed what was happening in front of them, but the guy who had been singled out had an ugly expression on his face.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I know you are a talent, younger brother Pei Yue,&quot; he said casually as he slowly rose to his feet from the chair he had been seated on. &quot;But don&apos;t you think it is a little too much to challenge an Immortal of Creation?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It would be one thing if you challenged one from outside of the sect, a mediocre one who had only comprehend one or two daos, but I am from the Celestial Sword Sect. I have already comprehended three daos. To defeat me you need to have comprehended seven daos or have a simply massive pool of Ancestral Worldpower.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are clearly a Primordial Immortal, so you do not have a big pool of Ancestral Worldpower, therefore to defeat me you would need to know quite a few daos. But you have only lived for fifty years... Even if you are extremely talented, there is a limit to how many daos you could have possibly comprehended.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue said nothing and stood still. His arms were crossed over his chest as if he were deep in thought. &quot;Seven daos, huh?&quot; he said as he started counting in his mind.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;We have my dao of flame, dao of ignition, our shared dao of inferno. We have your dao of gravity, the dao of sword, dao of devouring, and dao of the gale. That just so happens to be seven daos. Not bad, you can defeat him relying solely on daos,&apos; Lan Feng said excitedly, but Hui Yue shook his head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is true that I can contend with him when it comes to daos, but my daos cannot be merged, while his can. Not only that, he has much more Ancestral Worldpower. I need to be decisive and ruthless from the start.&quot; Hui Yue mumbled, and no one apart from Lan Feng heard what he was saying, but everyone noticed that he said something.</p><p dir="ltr">Smiling brightly, Hui Yue lifted his head and looked at the person he had challenged. &quot;Well I want to give it a try,&quot; he said decisively. &quot;If not for anything else, then for the sake of seeing the difference in power between a real Immortal of Creation and myself.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The immortal he had challenged felt proud when he heard Hui Yue refer to him as a real Immortal of Creation and he was certain that he had what it took to defeat this genius cultivator.</p><p dir="ltr">Secretly he was looking at Hui Yue with mixed emotions. Firstly he was worried. If he lost to this youngster, then he would lose all face he ever had.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, he wanted to defeat this young man. Hui Yue was a genius of their sect, someone that others could not compete against, and the young man who was challenged had always been considered mediocre. This was his chance to prove that he was strong enough by stop this genius here and now.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You initiated this duel,&quot; the Immortal of Creation stated with his high voice. &quot;No matter what, you will have to take the consequences of your decision of challenging me. I will not hold back, and no one can say I am bullying the weak.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">This was not meant for Hui Yue, but for the audience to hear. It was indeed as he said, Hui Yue had initiated it. He had tried to talk him out of the fight, but Hui Yue insisted. It was clear that Hui Yue would have to take responsibility for his actions.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue just shrugged his shoulders as he went within himself. There he pulled on Lan Feng&apos;s soul. He was getting ready for the battle to begin.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Immortal of Creation slowly made his way down to the arena where Hui Yue was waiting and the moment his foot landed on the ground he stomped hard and shot forward with speed unlike any Hui Yue had seen before.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Narrowing his eyes, he unleashed his powers. The first thing that burst out was an invisible pressure. This was the bloodline pressure of the Vermilion Bird, relying on both Lan Feng, who was a second descendant youth, and Hui Yue who had received some of the bloodlines of the Vermilion Bird.</p><p dir="ltr">Then brilliant wings sprung to life on Hui Yue&apos;s back, and the already pressuring aura exploded with another kind of pressure.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Both of these pushed down on the Immortal of Creation who was charging at Hui Yue. They made his speed decrease noticeably, but not enough to stop him.</p><p dir="ltr">Flapping his wings, Hui Yue took to the sky. Ten seals appeared around his outstretched hand as he started forming a formation in the air.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue started to control these seals, he also released the dao of gravity, constantly increasing and decreasing the gravity field in the arena. This made it hard for the Immortal of Creation to accurately control his body, and at the same time he reached out for the red gem within his core and reinforced his defenses.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue consumed a great amount of energy as all his attacks, defenses and tactics were unleashed one after another, and he poured even more energy into the seals before a deafening roar resounded in the arena as a blazing tiger was created from the formation.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not stop there; he poured Ancestral Worldpower with the dao of inferno, dao of ignition, and dao of flame into the tiger which continued to grow in size. Its body became shrouded in flames of varying strengths some were volatile and explosive, some were gentle, and others were just springing to life.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This tiger headed straight for the Immortal of Creation without Hui Yue needing to do anything. Hui Yue caught a slight breath of air before he flapped his wings and flew even higher.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Can&apos;t give up just yet,&quot; Hui Yue said as he weaved his soulforce together and made a net which he threw at the Immortal of Creation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Immortal of Creation was truly a proper immortal. He was not hurried in his attacks, nor was he panicked when he faced the tiger. He understood that if he wanted to defeat Hui Yue, then he needed first to get rid of the tiger, and although it was inconvenient to leave Hui Yue flying around, he had to take it step by step.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The audience was filled with buzzing as everyone discussed what they were seeing. Hui Yue had brought out one shock after another. All of them could feel the pressure emitted from his body; the pressure was so overwhelming that the weaker cultivators closest to the arena withdrew with pale faces to the back.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They had seen him use soulforce and formations. They had seen his brilliant wings, and although they were incapable of seeing what kind of daos he had used to enhance the strength of the tiger it was clear that it was more than just one dao of fire.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue released the dao of devouring and greedily started to devour the energy in the world around him to restore himself to his peak condition. While his opponent was using his Ancestral Worldpower to deal with the tiger, Hui Yue was rapidly absorbing energy and returning to peak condition.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The blue cloud exploded forth from Hui Yue&apos;s body, and soon it drifted down from the sky and laid itself like a blanket around the Immortal of Creation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although it was incapable of invading the body of his opponent, it was still capable of absorbing some of the Ancestral Worldpower in his attacks weakening them and forcing him to use more of his energy to deal with the tiger.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not done yet. &quot;Let&#x2019;s put on a show,&quot; he mumbled, and suddenly his body started to shift. His body enlarged, his muscles bulged, and his body became covered with red fur. The wings stayed on his back, but his body had become more than four times stronger than before.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Time to see how my physical strength compares to those of the Immortal of Creation rank,&quot; Hui Yue said as his wings folded and he shot downwards like a cannonball. He sped straight at the head of the Immortal of Creation.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What is that?!&quot; someone exclaimed.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He has dual bloodlines?! But... But that is impossible! The sect had tried to make someone with dual bloodlines for thousands of years but always failed! How can he possibly have dual bloodlines?!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;How ferocious! Look at that speed! He is at least twice as strong now as he was before!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone in the audience was filled with shock and disbelief. While some were clenching their hands in worry, others were filled with an urge to fight Hui Yue, but no matter whom it was, they understood why Hui Yue was viewed with such importance. He had displayed so much strength, so many abilities, techniques, and potential that even those in the audience who had been against him started to wonder if maybe it actually was for the best if the sect kept him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Take this!&quot; Hui Yue yelled out as his arm shot out. He brandished his claws, and a swipe landed on the Immortal of Creation&apos;s back.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This Immortal of Creation was not focused on Hui Yue. He had focused too much on getting rid of the tiger to notice that Hui Yue had come flying towards him and by the time he did notice it was already too late.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Blood flowed down the back of the Immortal of Creation as it was severely lacerated. His clothes were torn apart, and his face contorted showing his pain as he noticed he had made a mistake by completely ignoring Hui Yue before.</p><p dir="ltr">When he turned around, he stared dumbly at the half wolf half man that was standing in front of him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei... Pei Yue?!&quot; he exclaimed shocked, but his shock quickly vanished as he noticed that this wolf-man was getting ready to advance for another attack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will not lose to a mere Primordial Immortal like you!&quot; the Immortal of Creation screamed out as windblade after windblade appeared around his body. They were all incredibly condensed, and their speed was astonishing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One after another shot towards Hui Yue who dodged as agilely as a panther. His movements flowed like a fish in water, and his entire being was so graceful that everyone held their breath in awe.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was showing such amazing abilities. He was fighting an Immortal of Creation, and he was not losing out! If anything, he held the upper hand because both he and the tiger were able to work together to put pressure on the immortal in front of them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are asking for trouble!&quot; the Immortal of Creation finally yelled out, and a green light started to surround him. It was clear that he had had enough. He was no longer holding back, and he was going to use his real strength.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Bring it on!&quot; Hui Yue did not step down either; he was filled with fighting spirit. He was filled with an urge to show the entire Celestial Sword Sect just how capable he actually was.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The true showdown had just started!</p><br></div><p></p>
