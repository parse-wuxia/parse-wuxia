He carried himself with poise and never rushed to do anything. He was a person that everyone in the Ling family looked up to and respected, and although he was not too old, he was still seen as one of the most important people in their family.</p><p>To see him rushing into the room, Hui Yue was surprised. He too had only seen Ling Fang as being rather stoic.</p><p>What he did not know was now things had changed for Ling Fang. He had always considered himself a talented individual, but he also knew that he was born in a family that although they commanded some power in the western region were weak when compared to the real sects and families of the martial world.</p><p>Since this was the case, he knew that he would be unable to ever ranked as one of the strongest cultivators in the galaxy; therefore, Ling Fang decided to give his all for his family instead. He used his strength and abilities to help them improve their strength.</p><p>Rarely had Ling Fang looked up to someone. When he heard about Pei Yue, he figured that this young man was just a bit stronger than the others because he had been given more resources than the others. This was further reinforced especially when he heard that he was a third-generation descendant. He was certain that his strength came from resources that the sect had provided for him, and since he had been given a sea of resources, it was only natural for him to be much stronger than his peers.</p><p>It was not before now, where he had actually met the young man and seen him fight that he understood that this young man was truly not someone who relied solely on his sect&apos;s resources. He clearly had a heaven-sent talent since he was capable of fighting with overwhelming strength.</p><p>Ling Fang found that he looked up to this young man He found that he started wishing that he too had used his prime to cultivate rather than plan, guide, and learn how to manage a sect.</p><p>Since Hui Yue was looking for the Western Tiger, Ling Fang wanted to use the network he was so proud of to get information about her as soon as possible, and the moment he received a message from his branch members about her, he rushed towards the library to tell Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;Where is she?&quot; Lan Feng was the first to speak. Little Dragon too took a few steps forward. Of all the people present, Lan Feng and Little Dragon were the ones who cared the most for this tiger because he was their brother. The others were also curious about whom this person they considered to be their brother was.</p><p>Just as Ling Fang was about to inform everyone present about the information he had gathered, a loud siren blared through the city. Hearing this his eyes widened, his facial expression turned sour, and he stopped speaking out of shock.</p><p>&quot;What is going on?&quot; Zhong Fai asked curiously, and Hui Yue too looked at Ling Fang who quickly shook his head.</p><p>&quot;We do not have the time to be concerned about the Western Tiger right now,&quot; he said apologetically. &quot;This siren means that someone is attacking the city. It means that the demons have returned and are heading towards us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It means that every individual capable of fighting should ready for war.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As a member of the Ling family I too need to prepare,&quot; he apologized. &quot;You are not members of this city, so if you choose not to fight, no one will say anything, but I wish to see you on the battlefield, shining with your overwhelming might;show everyone that the demons are not to be fear, show them your true strength!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue grinned when he heard Ling Fang and nodded his head, &quot;Of course, we will fight!&quot; he said and then turned to look at his friends. &quot;We will fight the demons and help defend the city. Fighting against many of them will be challenging. It will be like fighting against tidal waves of demons, and although we are stronger than them, they will be many times more numerous than us.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue went into his pocket and took out some pills which he gave everyone. &quot;These pills restore Ancestral Worldpower,&quot; he explained. &quot;Take them if you find yourself in the middle of a pack of demons but feel out of energy.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue proceeded with handing out pills of various kind, and his friends happily accepted them. They already had a great many pills, but Hui Yue wanted to be double sure he gave his friends all they would need in case a dangerous situation arose. He would have no problems slaughtering the demons, but it was likely that the others would struggle from time to time.</p><p>Fortunately, all of them had a rather large Ancestral Worldpower pool after spending years in the Archaic World.</p><p>The entire Ling family was bustling with energy when they left the library. Experts were running back and forth, some towards the medicinal house to get pills, others towards the armory to spend their contribution points on better weapons or armor so that they could boost their power by even just a bit.</p><p>Seeing that everyone was busy, Hui Yue did not wish to interrupt them, and surprisingly enough, all that saw him were filled with awe.</p><p>&quot;The ancestor has gone to the front gate,&quot; one of the more knowledgeable experts informed Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;He wanted to see just what we are up against this time so that he can make his own preparations.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head and gathered his friends that had not been in the library.</p><p>&quot;We are heading to the front gates,&quot; he said seriously, feeling his blood pumping through his body and his fierce intent to do battle rise with each passing moment.</p><p>&quot;We should expect that there will be at least some of the more talented demons this time,&quot; he continued his speech as they made their way through the city which was also filled with activity. Everyone seemed to be headed for the front gate.</p><p>&quot;Last time they lost, they also found out that this city has some experts like old man Ling,&quot; Hui Yue said. &quot;They will have sent a specific amount of talented demons to hold down these supreme experts, and then they will let the flood of smaller demons eradicate everyone else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is our chance,&quot; Hui Yue grinned sinisterly. &quot;They have not calculated us being here. Of that, I am quite sure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And even if they have, they will just have sent one or two extra experts. We know that the Blood Demons do not have too many talented experts. For this reason, they won&apos;t be able to send more than a few over to take this world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since that is the case, I need you guys to fight against the horde of demons. Massacre them all; slaughter them without mercy.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s eyes had gone cold. &quot;They are the enemy of humanity; they wish to bring beasts, humans, ghosts, and spirits alike into slavery. I cannot accept this, so I would say that it is about time for us to rise and display our strength. Kill, kill, kill to your heart&#x2019;s content.&quot;</p><p>Pei Ziqi&apos;s face was filled with delight; she seemingly loved the idea of going onto a battlefield once more while some of the others, especially Lao, Jo, and Lei, were slightly uncomfortable with the thought. They had killed before, and they had viewed massacres, but they had never thrown themselves into a sea of enemies and slaughtered everything that came their way. This was a first for them.</p><p>&quot;If you experience someone you cannot defeat, then run. Run to either me, Ziqi, Jie, Huli, or Wei.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is a big chance that when we slaughter our way through these demons, we will alert the stronger ones of our presence, but that is something we already know. If you can fight them then great; kill them as well, but if you cannot then buy time, escape, and find someone who can kill them. I cannot stress this enough. Your safety is the most important. We cannot allow for you to become severely injured or die. If you are in trouble, call out or flee into the safety of the city behind us.&quot;</p><p>By now they had reached the city gates and saw that the gates were opened, and experts were pouring through them getting ready for the war that was to begin.</p><p>&quot;Spread out and merge with this sea of people,&quot; Hui Yue gave the order, and everyone followed. They all felt how they were getting more and more eager to start fighting. Even the nervous ones were sure that once the battle began, then they would feel much better about it all.</p><p>Hui Yue did not mingle in with the other experts at first, instead, he flew to the top of the city walls where he quickly located Old Man Ling.</p><p>Seeing that the old man was busy discussing tactics with a group of people, Hui Yue did not go over to interrupt him; instead, he went to the edge of the wall and looked out across the plains.</p><p>These plains had been filled with corpses when Hui Yue and his friends arrived at the city, yet now it was barren. No corpses could be seen, however, in the distance was a black mass that blotted out the horizon.</p><p>Demon cultivators were everywhere, and they were constantly advancing towards the city walls.</p><p>On the ground in front of the city walls was a sea of people and this sea was constantly expanding. Experts were rushing towards the demons, and as they moved, more and more experts poured out of the city. All of them were filled with bloodlust and rage against the demons.</p><p>They had all lost friends in the first massive battle against them; they had lost dear ones or family members to the savage demons. Now that the demons were back, they would fight with renewed ferociousness to protect the ones that were remaining.</p><p>Hui Yue spotted Wan Qiao in the sea of people, but she was so busy looking at the demons in front of them that she did not even have the time to look behind and notice Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;Young Yue,&quot; Old Man Ling&apos;s voice suddenly sounded behind Hui Yue, and he turned around with a smile on his face.</p><p>&quot;The battle is around to begin,&quot; Old Man Ling stepped forward and stood behind Hui Yue, looking at the many people beneath them. A gentle expression appeared on his face. &quot;I know you have a grudge against the demons and wish to kill as many of them as possible, but I am still grateful for yours and everyone&apos;s help. One person might not be able to defeat an army, but if you are strong enough, you can tip the balance.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. He knew that he alone could not eradicate this army of demons, but he would do everything in his power to kill as many of them as he could.</p><p>&quot;Charge at the demons, the strongest experts at the front!&quot; Old Man Ling yelled out, and a group of ten to twenty experts flew out from the city wall, heading for the front of the human-beast army.</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s eyes glittered as he looked in front of him. The battle was about to begin.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
