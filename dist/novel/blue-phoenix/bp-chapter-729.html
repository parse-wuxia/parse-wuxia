Every world was being fought over, but the war, in general, was now fought very differently from when they started.</p><p>Groups of experts patrolled the space, attacking their enemies on sight. Sometimes they would group up with other teams and attack a stronghold or a resting place used by their enemies, and other times they would attack caravans that carried valuables from one stronghold to another. Even merchants that went from world to world would be targets of the Blood Demons.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand the sudden change in the Blood Demons&apos; warfare,&quot; Wan Qiao said as she stabbed a spear into the head of a lowly Blood Demon.</p><p>The group was out hunting the three squads of demons that laid waste to every human or beast they came across, but it was as if something was keeping them separated on purpose. It was as if the Blood Demons knew exactly where Hui Yue&apos;s group was and for this reason, only cannon fodder was sent their way.</p><p>&quot;Their choice of changing tactics is actually rather good,&quot; Hui Yue said as he swung out his Sword of the Icy Tempest, beheading seven Blood Demons displaying the disparity between the two groups.</p><p>&quot;They will lose a whole lot of armies if they continue to siege the cities. However, if they just engage in small skirmishes like this, they will be able to get rid of more and more experts. Although they also pay a heavy price, the ones who are dying are not supreme experts as it was in the fight for the cities, it is the weaker demons that would die either way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When they have killed enough of our experts, then they will shift their focus back to the cities, and at this point, there won&apos;t be enough experts to protect them. Even the supreme experts would be hard pressed to kill a whole army of Blood Demons on their own.&quot;</p><p>&quot;At the same time, it allows for them to kidnap even more experts and transform them into Blood Demons, giving their side even more supreme experts.&quot;</p><p>The others nodded their heads as this made sense to them. &quot;If this is the case,&quot; Jia Na spoke up. &quot;Then why would the humans and beasts engage in meaningless battles with them? Is this not the same as kicking an iron board?&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue had a serious expression on his face as he nodded his head, &quot;it is indeed not a smart idea to engage in this kind of warfare, but there is no choice really,&quot; he sighed.</p><p>&quot;If we do not participate in this kind of warfare, who knows what the Blood Demons will do. They might go even more crazy throughout the entire western region than they were now; they might bring all their forces together and just take over one world at a time. No matter how strong we are, we might not be a match for all the Blood Demons at once.&quot;</p><p>No one spoke as the sad truth reached them. They were strong, yes, but they did not know how many supreme experts their enemy had. Although none of them posed a threat to Hui Yue himself, and if he met them he would easily be able to flee, but if he did so he would be unable to protect his friends.</p><p>Suddenly Hui Yue felt a tingling sense of danger. He looked around but saw no one around. &quot;Come here, all of you!&quot; he instantly yelled out, and everyone rushed to his side. The last Blood Demon had long since been slain, and all of them were just collecting the treasures and items from the corpses that were farther away.</p><p>&quot;Come here, now!&quot; Hui Yue yelled out once more, and all of them rushed to his side. The sense of danger was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>&quot;All of you, except Pei Ziqi, Lan Feng, and Wei enter the Universe Box.&quot;</p><p>The fact that he had ordered even Huli and Cai Jie into the box showed just how great he felt the danger was.</p><p>No one hesitated when Hui Yue reached out his arm and sucked up his friends into the space within the Universe Box.</p><p>Lan Feng said nothing; he was just on high alert. He could feel the wariness within Hui Yue&apos;s soul, and he knew that something big was happening.</p><p>Not only him, Wei and Pei Ziqi could not sense Hui Yue&apos;s emotions, but they could see on his face that this was serious. He was no longer playing around.</p><p>&quot;Did all these small groups of Blood Demons appear for the sake of luring us away from the Gate of Retribution&apos;s world?&quot; Hui Yue mused.</p><p>Over the last couple of weeks, one weak group of experts after another came into their path. Slowly these groups pulled them further and further away from the world they had planned to investigate</p><p>After thinking about it some more, Hui Yue instantly understood that Blood Demons had lured them to this specific location for some reason.</p><p>The feeling of danger in Hui Yue&apos;s mind worsened. He could feel the pressure coming closer and closer, and now it was not only Hui Yue who could feel it, but Pei Ziqi also had a manic smile on her lips as she brandished her battle Axe. Wei took out his golden spear and had a serious expression on his face.</p><p>Lan Feng did not use a weapon, but he was solemn. Hui Yue could feel the dao of fire starting to surround them.</p><p>It was clear that all four of them were preparing for a hard fight. Hui Yue was unsure of which weapon to use. Should he summon the Celestial Sword right from the start, or should he give Icy Tempest a try first?</p><p>As he was considering, he saw an army of experts moving towards them. In front was at least ten supreme experts and behind them were around a million weaker demons.</p><p>This million strong army was bigger and more formidable than the army that had attacked the City belonging to the Gate of Retribution.</p><p>Seeing this, Hui Yue frowned. It was clear that this army had been raised to deal with him and his friends, but what he did not understand was how they could have so much knowledge about them.</p><p>It was as if someone was feeding them information. Information about their movements, about their strength, and about their friends as well.</p><p>Hui Yue knew that there was no way he would be able to defeat them all if he held back, so instantly he summoned the Celestial Sword.</p><p>At the same time, before the demons managed to get close enough, seals also erupted from him as well. His soul force was now strong enough that he could form a thousand seals, and these seals were used to create the Ten Suns formation.</p><p>Ten brilliant suns of varying size appeared in front of him. All of them were burning with a fire unlike any the demons had ever felt before. If one came too close, then it was clear that they would be burnt to a crisp.</p><p>&quot;Although they are many, they will not be able to defeat us,&quot; Pei Ziqi said with a determined voice. &quot;There is a limit to how many can attack us at once. We just need to have a strong enough endurance to slaughter them all and then we will be fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Make sure you do not get wounded,&quot; Pei Ziqi continued. &quot;If you get wounded, even just a small wound, that can be catastrophic considering your restoration ability. One small wound might not count for much, but if you get more and more, you will need to use energy to ensure that you do not bleed to death. Eventually, because of this, you will run out of energy and die.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about me,&quot; Hui Yue said, his lips curling upwards. &quot;One of the lives I previously had was a witch who gathers lifeforce. We have slaughtered many Blood Demons, and they had quite a lot of lifeforce.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This lifeforce is turned into healing power the moment I am injured,&quot; Hui Yue said with some happiness in his voice. &quot;As long as I have lifeforce, I am quite hard to kill. And there is a whole army who is willing to give me their lifeforce as well. I will be able to stay alive for a very long time.&quot;</p><p>After that, he looked at the others and tossed a large group of medicinal pills towards Pei Ziqi, Lan Feng, and Wei. &quot;Take these. If you get low on Ancestral Worldpower or feel wounded, do not hesitate to use them. They could save your lives; don&apos;t stand on ceremony and try to conserve them.&quot;</p><p>Everyone nodded, and Hui Yue&apos;s eyes narrowed. The ones at the front of the army were all incredibly strong. It seemed as if every single one of them had comprehended three major daos, and there was even one who had comprehended four.</p><p>Even so, Hui Yue had no intention of fleeing. From the very start he had decided to fight till the end, and when he had made a decision, he would stand by it no matter what.</p><p>It would have been easy for him to outrun this army, but he knew that if he did, then they would definitely cause havoc in the Gate of Retribution&#x2019;s main city, and this was something he would never allow.</p><p>&quot;Pei Yue!&quot; The expert that had comprehended four major daos called out and all of the demons stood still.</p><p>Hui Yue did not respond; he just hovered in the air looking at the massive army in front of him with hostility in his eyes. He was going to slaughter them all, but first, he wished to hear what they had to say. Perhaps they were stupid enough to reveal how they knew everything about his movements and actions.</p><p>&quot;Hand over the Celestial Sword, and we will leave you with a complete corpse,&quot; the leader called out once more, his words causing Hui Yue to frown.</p><p>This group of experts knew about the Celestial Sword? They even knew that Hui Yue had it. But why would they want it? He could not understand it before a picture of his uncle appeared in his mind, but he quickly shook head. It was not likely that he had sold out Hui Yue&apos;s information. They were after all uncle and nephew and from the same sect.</p><p>&quot;If you want it, come take it,&quot; Hui Yue said casually. Since they already knew about the Celestial Sword, there was no reason to hide it, and he brandished the sword ready to welcome any demon that rushed towards him.</p><p>&quot;Pei Yue is strong! We need to be aware that we will have casualties, but we have a million strong army. His group consists of only three experts; they will be able to kill a few of us, but we will overwhelm them with sheer numbers, then we will end him. His lordship An He will reward anyone who kills this Pei Yue with ten Pills of Samsara.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue raised an eyebrow. He had one Pill of Samsara that he had been given by the Vermilion Bird. He had been told to take it if he was ever in mortal danger, but now it seemed as if these pills were nothing more than candy to the Blood Demons. Just what exactly did these pills do?</p><p></p></div><p></p>
