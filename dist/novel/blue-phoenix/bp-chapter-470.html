However, when they looked at Jo, they understood why. Not only was she healed, but her entire body had also been refined.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the young woman suddenly look so healthy, they understood that this was not any normal healing. They could tell that lifeforce was not used to heal her either. This was something altogether different, and when the bull saw it, his eyes were filled with shock.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The divine master offered the Nirvana Phoenix Flame to you?!&quot; He exclaimed shocked. Hui Yue nodded his head as he sat down on the ground, closed his eyes, and entered meditation. It was necessary for him to restore all his energy before they entered the Formation of Life.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue wished to tell everyone about his experiences and the Nirvana Phoenix Flame but now was not the time. Getting into the formation was the priority, and thus Hui Yue focused on restoring his strength.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">By his side, Jo no longer needed to cultivate. Her internal energy had been restored to their highest levels, and her entire body was bursting with energy. She was quite different from Hui Yue and Lao as both of them needed to restore their energy the regular way, by cultivating.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Lao and Hui Yue were in the same state. Neither of them had any energy left. Though, neither of them had any severe injuries. Hui Yue did not have any, and Lao had been healed by Wang Ju Long so now they were just waiting for their energy to restore.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Hey, why don&apos;t you tell me what kind of present you were going to give us?&quot; Deng Wu said smilingly at the bull, but he just shook his head. &quot;Not now.&quot; He said vaguely.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am glad that all of you succeeded this trial, and I will definitely give you a great treasure for your efforts, but today is not the time. Although I will be taking you to the Formation of Life, you have to accept that it will not be as easy to become a God as you might have thought. You don&apos;t just enter and then become a God; it is a slow process, and I cannot give you your treasure before at least one of you has attained such a rank.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Only one person can use the Formation of Life at a time and thus this is going to be a very slow process which requires patience.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The bull slowly explained to the many experts that were gathered around him. Although Hui Yue was fully focused on cultivating, and did not hear what was said, the bull was not worried; he knew that his friends would explain to Hui Yue later on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Who will be the first to enter the Formation of Life?&quot; The bull asked curiously looking at them all, but they all turned to look at Hui Yue. &quot;Obviously, it will be Yue.&quot; Deng Wu said as though there was no question about it.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Without Yue, none of us would be where we are today. He has done so much for us, from the time we were children to now. We consider him our oldest brother, even though he is younger than us. He is the one who wants the best for us, and he always makes sure that we get anything we want; anything we need, he will give to us.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yue is the strongest of us all. Even when we become Gods, we might not be his match. Therefore, to increase the overall strength of our team, having him become a God first would be the most beneficial.&quot; Cai Jie added, and Lao and Jo just shrugged. &quot;We are only Emperors. Although we can become Gods as well, it will definitely take a long time. Thus is it only logical to have the highest ranked experts go first.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing that they were all willing to give up the first spot for the Formation of Life to Hui Yue made the bull feel warm inside. He expected it, but he was also ready for at least one of them to be greedy and seize this opportunity to enter first. Especially now that Hui Yue was not paying attention to what was happening around him.</p><p dir="ltr">The bull expected that Cai Jie would offer to take the spot as the first person to enter the formation because he had never really been far behind Hui Yue in anything. His cultivation and strength were just a small step behind, yet it seemed that he had no intention of taking over this group. It seemed that Hui Yue had the full support of his friends.</p><p dir="ltr">A few hours went by while they were focused on cultivating and everyone was excited about the trip to the Formation of Life.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue opened his eyes, a flame burned within before it slowly extinguished itself. His body was filled with abundant energy, so much so that Hui Yue could feel that he had advanced yet again.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This time the advancement was not major, but even a small step forward was still a great benefit. This was especially true when he looked at how much Jo had benefitted from the whole ordeal.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was not long after that Lao also woke up. Clearly, he had gained more advancements than Hui Yue from having used up all his energy, but considering his strength was lower it made sense.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It seems like you are all ready.&quot; The bull said as he looked at them. He could not help but feel excited himself. A new owner of the Formation of Life had arrived, and that meant a lot to not just the Divine Beast World but also the bull himself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Stand together, and hold each other&#x2019;s hands.&quot; The bull instructed, and everyone followed his order straight away. No one questioned why they suddenly had to hold hands when they never had to do so before, just as they didn&apos;t question where they were going.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing them comply with his orders once more gave the bull a pleasant feeling. He really did like this group of youngsters. Even though they had succeeded, they had not become arrogant or complacent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as they all took each other&apos;s hands and created a circle around the big bull, he lifted his hands, and a silvery light shone from his entire body. It had the color of mercury, and this light started to flow onto the ground before it rose in the air. It formed a barrier of flowing, silvery energy around the entire group. The outside world was blocked out, and as they were completely surrounded by this silvery light, everything turned dark.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While in this darkness, everything seemed to try to pull them all away from one another but since the bull had told them to hold each other&#x2019;s hands, they held on. The world twisted and turned around them making it almost impossible to understand what was going on. As all of them had become confused, nauseated, and uncomfortable, the silvery barrier started to break from the top. It once more let the light of the world inside while slowly disintegrating. The light vanished into the bull in the same manner it had appeared.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking around, they were all stunned. They were standing on top of a mountain, yet this mountaintop had no peak. It was flat, and everything in the world was red. There was a blazing red sun in the sky, the sand on the ground was red, and even the rock of the mountain was red Everything was red, and right in front of them was a large formation. It was the most complex formation Hui Yue had ever seen and just looking at it hurt his eyes. It was engraved on the mountaintop itself, and Hui Yue understood that the one he had seen in his trial was far different from the real formation.</p><p dir="ltr">Engraved into the ground were four overlapping circles which were interwoven into one another, and within these four circles were four depictions of the four Divine Beast Gods. Mixed in with these were also the patterns of stars, trees, and signs that Hui Yue had never seen before. All of this was carved into the ground below.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;How am I supposed to take it with me?&#x2019; Was what Hui Yue thought, but for now, that was not the most important thing. He felt as though he was standing in the middle of a storm. The essence of the heavens and the earth which were being created within this formation was so plentiful that it felt like a real storm when it left the formation. The pressure in the whole area was immense, and Jo, Lao, Sha Yun, Wang Ju Long, and Deng Wu were forced a few steps backward by the strong gusts of energy.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The first person to enter should do so now. The rest of you should use this energy to raise your cultivation level as much as you can. The higher your rank, the less time you will need within the Formation of Life.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head, and everyone looked at him with great expectations. &quot;Go!&quot; Wang Ju Long and Sha Yu both urged him. They nudged him forward, and Hui Yue steeled himself and nodded his head as he inched closer and closer to the formation.</p><p dir="ltr">The closer he approached, the more intense the energy and pressure became. At some point he even had problems breathing because the energy was entering his mouth and nose, almost choking him. After stopping for a second, he steadied himself and breathed deeply as he stepped forward.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Inching closer and closer everyone looked at him with wide eyes. Some were fearful that suddenly the formation would swallow Hui Yue, while others were just excited about the fact that Hui Yue would soon become a God. Watching Hui Yue, Cai Jie&apos;s eyes were shining, and he instantly sat down starting to cultivate. He was not in the mood to wait and watch any longer as he felt a longing from deep within. A longing to once more become a God. A longing to get revenge for his slain martial brother. Cai Jie understood that the more he trained now, the sooner he too would become a God.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone had their own goals in life, but all of them felt that they had been given a chance at these goals because of Hui Yue. Therefore no one envied him being first. The volatile essence of the heavens and the earth around them was so dense that it was a hundred times more effective than when they cultivated in the Divine Beast World.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Cai Jie sit down and start cultivating, it did not take long before everyone else followed his lead. With one last look at Hui Yue, who was still inching closer to the formation, everyone&apos;s eyes filled with determination. They had to raise their strength as much as they possibly could before it was time for them to enter the formation. They owed it to Hui Yue to do their very best!</p><p dir="ltr">The bull had a smile on his face as he looked at Hui Yue and the others, nodding his head in approval. &#x201C;This batch of experts was clearly much better than that An He and his followers. I am glad that the divine master made us wait for the right cultivator to arrive. Even though we were unhappy with his arrangements, there is no shame when the experts in question are these children.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the bull spoke out loud no one heard the words he said. Everyone was fully focused on themselves. All, apart from Hui Yue, were cultivating, while Hui Yue was slowly struggling with the dense energy trying to enter the Formation of Life. He had never expected that it was like trying to break through a wall. A wall created from sheer energy.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
