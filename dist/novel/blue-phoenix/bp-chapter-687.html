He had understood this long ago. Although he had succeeded this time it was basically due to luck and willpower alone. If he continued to put such pressure on himself every time he was creating a body, then it was likely that he would end up wounding his soul instead.</p><p>He wanted to be able to form a body easily. He was rather certain that by the time he had finished the last body he needed to refine for himself and his friends, he would be able to create them effortlessly, but for now, this was not the case.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x2019;s make your body next,&quot; the Alchemist God decided. &quot;Your Ancestral Worldpower pool will grow remarkably after changing your body from an ordinary one to one that has been refined according to this formula.&quot;</p><p>&quot;With a bigger Ancestral Worldpower pool you will be able to last much longer while refining, and you will also feel not as exhausted after refining a body.&quot;</p><p>Once again, Hui Yue nodded his head. What the Alchemist God said made perfect sense.</p><p>He sat down and found the materials for the next body and slowly started to refine the body in front of him.</p><p>He once more reached the point where he needed to mold the pillar of energy into a figure, but this time it was a failure.</p><p>Without caring too much about a simple failure, Hui Yue took a two-hour break after which he once more returned to refining. This time he reached the molding phase once more, and again it turned out to be a failure. Seeing this, Hui Yue could not help but frown.</p><p>It was not that he expected to have a hundred percent success rate after creating his first body, but now that he had succeeded, he was slightly impatient. His impatience could be seen in his work.</p><p>Although the Alchemist God had noticed what his mistake was, he did not say anything and instead allowed for Hui Yue to figure it out on his own.</p><p>After having failed twice, Hui Yue seemed to have understood where he erred. So he once again began the refinement process and purposefully slowed the tempo to the lowest he could while still ensuring to refine the materials at the right speed so that the energy would merge with one another.</p><p>When he had refined all the materials and was about to start molding the figure he did not dive straight in as he had done the two previous times but took a deep breath and steadied his thumping heart. After which he calmed himself down and reached out for the pillar of energy.</p><p>The molding process this time was in no way simpler than it had been when he was creating the body for Wang Ju Long. He felt how his energy was being used at a frighteningly fast pace, but he continued to support himself with the energy he had in his body, and he did not relax in the slightest.</p><p>Hui Yue took his time molding this body, and it took longer than when he had created the first body. He was pushing himself to the limits, and in the last hour, he started seeing black dots in his vision. As he finished, he fell to the ground and breathed heavily, gasping for air as if he had been drowning just prior.</p><p>Hui Yue did not waste any time, and after having laid down on the ground for a few moments, he forced his sore and exhausted body into a seated position as he looked at the body in front of him.</p><p>This one was not as long-limbed as the previous one, but it was in no way a masterpiece either.</p><p>The Alchemist God was observing it. He was looking at every single angle, at every single pore of the body and even sent some Ancestral Worldpower into the body to test the inside of it before he nodded his head.</p><p>&quot;This is a success, congratulations, you have managed to create another perfect body.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this Hui Yue could not help but be jubilant, and he instantly shed his current body and allowed for his soul to float towards the new one.</p><p>Leaving behind a body was in no way an easy thing to do. One could only do so if they were in a completely safe location and if they were certain that the body they would have was of superior quality to the one they were leaving, but Hui Yue did not hesitate for even a moment.</p><p>The body he refined was given the all-clear from the Alchemist God, meaning that it was indeed a perfect body. It would be impossible to find a better body throughout the galaxy, and since this was the case, then Hui Yue had no qualms with discarding his old one.</p><p>Entering the new body, he felt as if he had been submerged under water. Everything was dark as his eyes were closed, and he could sense a raging energy that at first seemed to clash with his soul, yet after each of these clashes it mellowed out.</p><p>It was as if it was testing the soul and feeling it resonating after which it would change accordingly.</p><p>This was the process of the body taking on the soul&apos;s features. Hui Yue could feel how his Ancestral Worldpower pool slowly settled within the body, but although it had settled, it was far from still.</p><p>Energy kept pouring into the Ancestral Worldpower pool, making it constantly breakthrough its limitations and increase in size.</p><p>It was not only his Ancestral Worldpower pool that was being nurtured. His soul which had entered was also feeling the energy of the body bonding with it. The entire body was just one mass of energy, so much energy that it would almost be impossible to gather it in one place if it was not for the help of the refinement process.</p><p>The dark world slowly turned lighter and lighter. At the same time, Hui Yue felt that he was in the middle of a raging tempest. His body was starting to respond to him. He could feel his hands, his feet, and everything else.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and saw the bright world that he had left just moments before. As for how long it had taken him to get used to this new body, he had no idea.</p><p>When he woke up, he noticed that Wang Ju Long, Sha Yun, and Huli were all looking at him. Wang Ju Long was looking incredibly shy, Huli had a casual smile on her face as if she had not noticed that he was naked, and Sha Yun was looking at him with burning eyes making him feel that if she had it her way then maybe snake babies would be born rather soon.</p><p>Wrapping himself in some clothes he had made from Ancestral Worldpower, he could not help but smile when he saw that Wang Ju Long had relief on her face and Sha Yun had disappointment on hers.</p><p>Hui Yue clenched his hand and felt the strength he now controlled had increased a lot.</p><p>His comprehension of the dao had not increased, but his Ancestral Worldpower pool had more than doubled just from changing bodies, not to mention, his body alone was now as strong as a treasure. It was almost impossible to be injured by someone unless they had some astonishing power or controlled a rather high amount of daos.</p><p>&quot;You should have an easier time refining bodies now,&quot; the Alchemist God said with a smile. Hui Yue nodded his head in agreement. He understood that the reason the Alchemist God was as exhausted as he was when he refined a body was precisely because he had not refined anything for a very long time.</p><p>Now that he had healed his soul, he spent every waking moment concocting pills, but all the pills he finished were given to Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;I need to grow accustomed to this body,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile, and he looked at Huli. &quot;Want to spar with me so I can test the limits of my new body?&quot;</p><p>Now that he had gained this perfect body he understood just why Huli was as strong as she was. It was simply outstanding and overwhelmingly powerful.</p><p>Huli had a disadvantage when it came to daos, but she did not fear Hui Yue, and she instantly agreed.</p><p>&quot;Is sister Huli really that strong?&quot; Wang Ju Long asked Sha Yun who nodded her head and smiled as gently led Wang Ju Long towards the martial fields of the worn out sect.</p><p>The martial fields were not well looked after, but there were some stages and arenas which had survived the passing of time, and Hui Yue and Huli jumped on top of one of these arenas.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t hold back,&quot; Huli said with a grin. &quot;Although you have comprehended more major daos than me, I have studied my dao for a long time, and I have much more experience with a perfect body than you do. Although I might not be able to beat you, I have faith in my ability to stay alive even when you go all out.&quot;</p><p>Having said this, Huli&apos;s body instantly started to change. She was no longer in her human form but in her beast form. She towered high above Hui Yue who could not help but take a step back.</p><p>Huli was a black nine-tailed fox. A divine beast which was incredibly strong. Beasts already had an advantage because of their bodies and bloodlines, but Huli had an even stronger advantage because of her perfect body.</p><p>&quot;I am sure you will be fine,&quot; Hui Yue said with a wry smile as he looked at the massive black fox in front of him, &quot;but what about me? Who will protect me? One swipe of your claws and I will become mincemeat!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop being such a wuss!&quot; Huli scolded with a light, happy voice, &quot;I will be kind and not go after your throat. Worst case scenario means that you will have to lay in bed for a few months. I promise that I won&#x2019;t kill you.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, Wang Ju Long started fretting. She was not familiar enough with Huli to know that she was just bluffing. Although she would spar seriously with Hui Yue, she would never wound him.</p><p>Sha Yun placed a hand on Wang Ju Long&apos;s shoulder. &quot;Don&apos;t worry, just watch how strong they are,&quot; she said with a smile on her face. &quot;You need to understand just how strong Hui Yue is now. Huli has always been a monster but so is our Yue. Those two are both people who we can trust our lives with and know for sure that we will be safe!&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
