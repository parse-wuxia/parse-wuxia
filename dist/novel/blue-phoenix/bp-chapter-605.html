After thinking about it for a moment, he shook his head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although there are many things I could use right now, the thing I need the most is time. No one is able to give me more time than what I already have. Thus all I can do is to depend on myself. I will make you proud of me I swear. One day I will become so strong that everyone within the galaxy will have to bow to me. In this dog eat dog world, I will be the strongest!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had never before said this out loud. Lan Feng knew of Hui Yue&apos;s character and personality, and even his thoughts were known by Lan Feng. Therefore the phoenix knew that Hui Yue was aiming for the rank above an Immortal of Creation, Hui Yue was aiming to become an Overlord.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When Pei Tian heard Hui Yue state his dreams, he did not laugh at him neither did he doubt the son who was in front of him. Instead, his heart swelled with pride, and he nodded his head. This was his son! This was the man who would one day become the ruler of the galaxy! Pei Tian only hoped that he would live long enough to be able to see his son&#x2019;s dream come to fruition.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That is the spirit!&quot; he exclaimed as he hit Hui Yue on his back with a powerful, broad hand. &quot;You will become the strongest in the galaxy! My son will be an Overlord!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was unprepared for the slap on his back and was sent flying through the room. He tumbled around until he finally managed to stop himself as he reached the wall.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Coughing, Hui Yue turned around and sent a wry smile to his father. A casual slap from him contained such strength! It was impossible to say just how strong his father really was, and he was not even the Crowned Sovereign of the Celestial Sword Sect World.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was very curious about his father&apos;s actual strength, but no matter how much he thought about it, he understood that it was already above his understanding. His father was likely as strong as the Kings of Hell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing in admiration, it was impossible for Hui Yue not to be proud of his father and the smile on his face grew larger. Things were going the right way. He was restoring Wang Ju Long&apos;s soul, and at the same time, he was also getting stronger and stronger. His father displayed incredible strength, and everything was silent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue worked best when he was under pressure. He had the constant pressure of An He hanging above his head all his life, yet now this pressure had diminished. Although An He was strong, Hui Yue was currently protected not only by the Celestial Sword Sect but also by Diyu. No matter how strong An He was, it was impossible for him to make any moves.</p><p dir="ltr">Although currently An He could not move and pressure him right now, he understood that the stronger he became, the better it would be for his chances of survival. Thus he was not going to just sit back and enjoy it. He was going to become stronger and protect the ones dear to him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I heard you had a lady friend with you back in Diyu,&quot; Pei Tian suddenly said, making Hui Yue return from his train of thoughts. He was confused for a moment before he remembered that Huli had been with him. He nodded his head hesitantly, not sure what his father was getting at.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This woman was quite strong as far as I have heard. She is a beast, right?&quot; Pei Tian continued with a cheeky smile on his face, and Hui Yue was getting slightly flustered, unsure of why his father was asking so many questions.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Her name is Huli, and yes, she is a Black Ninetailed Fox.&quot; Hui Yue said honestly while pausing for a moment. He did not want to lie to his father, so he sighed and continued, &quot;There are three people I love,&quot; he admitted. &quot;One is already dead, but Yanluo has told me how to resurrect her, and when I do she will become a God.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The other is a mix of a beast and a human. Her name is Sha Yun; she is a lamia. Currently, she is mortal, but it is just a matter of time before her strength reaches the God rank.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;And then we have Huli. She is already an Immortal of Creation, and she is not weak. She has comprehended at least one major dao.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not hold anything back and introduced the three to his father. His words caused his father to chuckle, and he lifted an eyebrow in surprise.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Three women, huh?&quot; he asked with a chuckle, &quot;that is quite a few women for someone who has lived for a mere fifty years.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, anyways, although you have three women that just means that I will have more grandchildren! Snake babies even? I have never seen snake babies in our sect, but it will be a pleasant change of pace around here.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;I like this old man!&apos; Lan Feng&apos;s voice echoed in Hui Yue&apos;s mind, &apos;Snake babies are a great idea! We want lots of those and not just for you but also for me. Our snake babies can even become good friends.&apos;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue laughed hollowly, not really sure what to say. His father and Lan Feng were doomed to become good friends when they met, but their conversations were bound to embarrass him to no end.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even now he was already embarrassed from discussing this matter and noticing Hui Yue&#x2019;s embarrassment his father just laughed loudly and patted him on the shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Right now you should be able to bring Huli to the sect if you marry her, but we cannot bring the mortal lamia yet... Was it Sha Yun you called her? Neither can we do anything currently about the one who has died.&quot; He lamented with a sigh.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I understand that you wish to be with all three of them, but we are immortals. We cannot have mortals in our sect, however, as long as they become immortals, then I will make sure they are accepted into the sect.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Tian was serious for once as he looked at Hui Yue. &quot;I just ask you to not have any children with these women before you marry them. It will be very troublesome if you get children outside of the sect&#x2019;s approval, but as long as you do not do that, then I can let you marry whatever woman you want as long as they are Gods.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was surprised. Not by the fact that he was not allowed to have any children before he was married, but because his father promised to allow him to marry whomever he wished to marry.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was in no way a simple promise. It was not easy for women to be allowed into the Celestial Sword Sect as wives and many had been declined by the elders of the sect, but Pei Tian promised that the women Hui Yue wanted would be the ones he would marry. This would require Pei Tian to use all the connections and power he had within the sect, including all the favors that people owed him. To be willing to use his influence for the sake of Hui Yue, the young man was incredibly proud and happy. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, don&apos;t let this old man hold you back any longer,&quot; Pei Tian laughed as he saw the gratitude in Hui Yue&apos;s expression. &quot;I will be going to rest for some time, tell me when you wish to bring your first wife into the sect and I will help you.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue contemplated for a short while, and then he shook his head. &quot;I won&apos;t have her join us yet,&quot; he said with a sigh. Although he missed Huli, he also missed the others badly as well. He missed his friends, and he needed Huli to control the Formation of Life so that he could have all of them become Gods.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although they could meet up within the Divine Beast World, Hui Yue knew as well as the others that it was impossible for them to start their true adventure before all of them had become Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">While they used the Formation of Life one after another, those who had already become Gods would be focused solely on comprehending the daos in their surroundings.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">To them, it did not matter whether they were in the Divine Beast World or the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s World. As a matter of fact, after the Formation of Life had been returned to the Divine Beast World, it had much purer energy than the Celestial Sword Sect had, and thus they benefitted most from staying where they were.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Tian was unaware of all these thoughts, but he did not ask Hui Yue any questions. He had long since understood that Hui Yue had come from the Divine Beast World, yet the moment Hui Yue entered the galaxy this world vanished.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There was only one way to explain this, and that was to say that Hui Yue had the Universe Box and had taken the world with him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Were it anyone else who had reached this conclusion, then there would have been quite some drama. The elders who were against Hui Yue would do everything in their power to force him to give up such a treasure, but the only ones who knew were the two ancestors and the patriarch. Those three had long since seen all the kind of treasures there were in this universe, and none of them wished to steal away Hui Yue&apos;s storage treasure.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding his head to his father, Hui Yue understood that their conversation had come to an end. Since he was still in a hurry to get his hands on some contribution points, he turned to leave the mountain top once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Tian did not hold him back and just watched as he vanished down the mountainside, his face lit up with a smile. &quot;Three sweethearts. I will definitely get quite some grandchildren! Oh how wonderful it is to have a family once more!&quot; he exclaimed as he turned and entered far deeper into the mountain than Hui Yue had ever been.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was unaware of how much happiness his conversation had brought his father, all he knew was that he felt much better. He had been very fearful about the fact that he had three women that he wished to bring with him to the sect, but now he understood that there was nothing to fear as long as they managed to become Gods. Pei Tian had promised to look after the rest.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Knowing them well enough, they will strive to become the strongest women in the entire sect,&quot; he chuckled to himself as he remembered how Sha Yun and Wang Ju Long had fought day in and day out to become the strongest, always training and never relaxing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;They are like you,&apos; Lan Feng chuckled. &apos;Training maniacs. Not willing to let anything go and never giving in.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Says you,&quot; Hui Yue laughed back. &quot;You have already merged three daos together, and you are really quite far on the way to having merged four daos! Soon you will have comprehended the entire dao of fire. You are quite terrifying when you focus on cultivating as you are now,&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Lan Feng said nothing but Hui Yue could sense that he was proud. After a brief silence, the phoenix cleared his throat and finally said, &apos;Why don&apos;t you just hurry up and go to the Mission Tower. It is about time that you get your hands on some contribution points.&apos;</p><br></div><p></p>
