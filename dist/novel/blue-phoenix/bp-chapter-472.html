His temperament seemed much more majestic than what they were used to. He was like an emperor overlooking his subjects. His eyes were incredibly gentle but if one were to look within they would find it impossible to look away. At that moment, they would feel as though their soul was being sucked out.</p><p dir="ltr">A gentle smile had been on his lips since he returned and it seemed liked it would stay there as well as an aura of mystery that had appeared around this young man. Looking at him, it was simply impossible for them to understand just how powerful he was, and what secrets were hidden within his newly created body.</p><p dir="ltr">It was not only his personality and demeanor which had changed, but his body was clearly completely different from before. His skin was now milky white with a silvery sheen, and as soft as a newborn baby&#x2019;s. He had grown taller but also less muscular and his entire body had changed to one formed from energy.</p><p dir="ltr">Although he had lost his lower dantian, Lan Feng and the nine caves had not vanished, and neither had the Nirvana Phoenix Flame or his elemental flames.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Around his chest area, where his middle dantian used to be, a small cave had appeared, and everything was gathered within. Although the cave seemed incredibly small, it was able to contain many things, and never seemed cramped.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue found that he still had access to all the energies that he had before, except Qi, spiritual energy, and Wu Wei; however, the loss of these three energies was not a big deal to Hui Yue. As long as he still had the blue cloud, the beast core, and lifeforce, alongside his newfound Ancestral Worldpower, he was satisfied.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was no longer a mortal, and therefore, his life expectancy was limitless. He could live for eternity as long as he did not get killed. When he became a God his lifeforce didn&#x2019;t seem to matter in terms of vitality, but was now a strong current of energy in his body that he could draw upon.</p><p dir="ltr">The changes not only affected his lifeforce, but his other energies as well. With his beast core Hue Yue could feel that it had been moved to his chest cave and was pulsating with a terrifying amount of energy just waiting to be unleashed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His beast energy had been refined by the Ancestral Worldpower and was now much stronger than before. Now his beast core was so full of energy that Hui Yue almost feared it would burst.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When Hui Yue first realized that his entire body was being recreated cell by cell into a body from Ancestral Worldpower, he started pondering on the differences between humans and beasts.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Humans were different from beasts in that when they became Gods they had to have their bodies remade from Ancestral Worldpower whereas beasts did not. Humans had to give up their current energies for the more refined and powerful Ancestral Worldpower.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hue Yue&#x2019;s human body had been reformed by the Ancestral Worldpower, but this did not mean that his previous body was of no concern to his advancement and strength at the God rank.</p><p dir="ltr">Quite the contrary, Hue Yue found that when one&#x2019;s body became immortal it would fuse their flesh and blood with the Ancestral Worldpower, and therefore, the stronger one&#x2019;s body was before this process, the better foundation they would have as a God ranked cultivator.</p><p dir="ltr">The body was the foundation of a God&#x2019;s strength, and Hui Yue had quite an outstanding body even compared to those cultivators in the heavenly worlds. This was due to the various rewards he had gotten over his many travels. Especially, the last advancement he gained from the Vermilion Bird&#x2019;s longevity blood.</p><p dir="ltr">During his time in the Formation of Life, his body had fused with so much Ancestral Worldpower that he felt like he had a massive reservoir of power, like a deep lake, and he could feel energy roaming throughout his entire body!</p><p dir="ltr">The memories Hui Yue had of the red wolf becoming a God were completely different than what he had experienced. This was why he knew of the differences between humans and beasts. The transition from being a Saint to becoming a God was not a process where the wolf&apos;s body was reformed into a body made from Ancestral Worldpower; instead, his body stayed mostly the same from when he was mortal. The wolf&#x2019;s flesh and blood were just strengthened and enhanced by Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p dir="ltr">Due to their energy coming from their beast cores they did not need to become a being created from energy. During this process, their souls fused with the Ancestral Worldpower making them become immortals. As a beast, at the time they reached the Saint level, their bodies were already as strong as divine treasures. Where the mortal human body could not accommodate an immortal soul, the beast bodies were capable of doing so, and therefore, they did not need to have their body reformed.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I wonder why humans were created so much weaker than beasts and demons.&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself as he was caught up in his earlier ponderings, but he also knew that this was something that he did not have time to dwell on at the moment. He had just become a God, and there were many secrets of the universe which he was currently not fit to know.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of continuing to think about these things, Hui Yue shook his head. He once more smiled at the bull who had patiently been waiting since he saw Hui Yue&apos;s eyes grew distant. He was in no rush, and seeing that Hui Yue was thinking about something, he did not interrupt. Hui Yue had after all just become a God. He had many thoughts that needed to be fully comprehended, and need to seek enlightenment in meditation on them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the bull saw that Hui Yue was present once more, he turned to move towards the Formation of Life. Lifting his hand, he was moving as effortlessly as Hui Yue had just before. The closer he came to the formation, the more curious Hui Yue and the others became.</p><p dir="ltr">The bull did not enter the barrier, but the moment he reached the formation he lifted both his arms and the ground started trembling. An earthquake appeared out of nowhere, and soon a small crack appeared in the ground around the Formation of Life. At first, it was just a small crack, but it rapidly grew. In a matter of moments, it changed from a small crack to a large canyon. This canyon destroyed the mountain on which they were standing and made it split into multiple peaks with the formation floating in the middle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You can store this formation within me.&quot; A voice suddenly rang out in Hui Yue&apos;s mind, one he knew very well. The voice of the spirit of the Universe Box.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After having become a God, this Universe Box and he were much more compatible. It was now much easier for Hui Yue to converse with the spirit, and he no longer needed to enter the box to do so. Also, now it was possible for him to use a great deal more space than he could before.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh, I can?&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously. He had worried about how to bring this formation with him, however, if he could store it in the Universe Box, then that would solve his problem.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I told you before that if you get strong enough, you can even store the entire galaxy in my space.&quot; The spirit said with a humph, clearly insulted that he had not listened earlier. &quot;I was not joking. At your current strength, having this formation and a few living beings inside is absolutely not an issue.&quot; He continued proudly, and his words caused Hui Yue to feel excited. He could even hold living beings within the box... Wouldn&apos;t that be the safest place to cultivate?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Jie!&quot; Hui Yue called out, and he instantly turned to look at him. His eyes were blazing with excitement. He did not know what Hui Yue was about to say, but he could guessed the gist of it. It was now his turn to become a God.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Enter the formation, and no matter what happens, stay within until you become a God once more!&quot; Hui Yue ordered, and Cai Jie nodded his head seriously. He was unaware of Hui Yue&apos;s plans, but he would follow his directions anytime.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Moving forward, Cai Jie easily jumped past the canyon that had appeared between them and the formation before he reached the barrier.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Use Ancestral Worldpower to cover the part of your body which is entering the barrier.&quot; Hui Yue advised with a low voice, but for Cai Jie, it felt as though his good friend was right by his side causing him to be excited for what was coming. Hearing the solution of how to go through the barrier, Cai Jie followed the instructions as closely as he could. Finally, after a short while, he managed to get a part of his body through.</p><p dir="ltr">His facial expression changed as he felt the ravaging gusts of energy which blew around inside the barrier. Though, he soon steadied his face and his eyes shone with determination. He was determined to enter this formation even if it cost him greatly.</p><p dir="ltr">It went pretty much the same as when Hui Yue entered. Blood flowed freely from his face by the time he tried to finally push through.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone watched as Cai Jie finally managed to break through the barrier, and all of them were amazed. It was one thing that Hui Yue had succeeded in breaking through the barrier, but for Cai Jie to do so was much harder.</p><p dir="ltr">What they did not know was that Cai Jie&apos;s body could not truly withstand the pressure, but with sheer stubbornness and his urge to become a God once again, he forced himself through it. He would never give up in pursuit of his goals.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Arriving inside the barrier, Cai Jie did exactly what Hui Yue told him to. He went straight to the middle and sat down starting to cultivate.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Cai Jie enter the barrier, Hui Yue nodded in approval. Hui Yue lifted his hand, and a golden light shone from his palm as a box appeared out of nowhere.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The Universe Box?!&quot; The bull exclaimed shocked as he saw that Hui Yue summoned forth such a treasure; his eyes went wide and were on the verge of popping out of his head. His mouth was agape, like a stranded fish, and his heart was beating erratically.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue ignored the bull and focused on the voice within his mind. &#x2018;You now have the power to summon forth my true self, but only do so when it is absolutely necessary. You are not strong enough to keep this box. If it got out that you were in possession of a treasure such as myself, every expert would hunt you down.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Now surround the Formation of Life with you Ancestral Worldpower and after that slowly drag it towards you.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue frowned but did as he was told, and soon the formation of life with Cai Jie inside started floating towards him. The golden light from within the Universe Box started shining much brighter than it had previously. This light left the box illuminating the outside world. The golden light moved to surround the Formation of Life, as it slowly shrank in size.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Cai Jie was already deep in meditation and he did not notice that the world around him was shrinking. That the world was constantly becoming smaller and smaller and was moved into a storage realm.</p><p dir="ltr">It was then swallowed before the box slowly vanished into Hui Yue&apos;s palm once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Cai Jie and the Formation of Life had completely vanished from the face of the realm, but Hui Yue could feel Cai Jie&apos;s heartbeat. Closing his eyes and reaching out with his consciousness, he could also see Cai Jie who was cultivating within the formation. He watched his friend who still had not noticed what had happened to him.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue opened his eyes as the golden light vanished and everyone looked at him as if he were a monster.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You have the Universe Box in your possession?!&quot; The bull exclaimed loudly, as he looked at Hui Yue with shock and uncertainty in his eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh, you know of it?&quot; Hui Yue asked surprised, and only now did he remember the words that the spirit had told him moments ago. &quot;Please do not tell anyone that I possess this item.&quot; He said humbly, and the bull nodded his head. &quot;It&#x2019;s not good for others to know that this storage realm has once more resurfaced in the universe. When it last appeared, it was an event big enough to shake the entire galaxy and shatter the peace of the heavenly worlds. You are far too weak to protect it as you are now, and thus we cannot tell anyone about this.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The fact that you have the Universe Box is a great blessing though.&quot; The bull continued as his face was filled with a great smile. &quot;This makes it much easier for me to gift you with the second item I wish to give you.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the bull spoke everyone became interested. Off in the distance one beam of light after another appeared heading in their direction. As for what these beams of lights were, Hui Yue did not know, but he knew that something major was about to happen.</p><br></div><p></p>
