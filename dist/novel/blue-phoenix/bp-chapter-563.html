It was not just one room, but a group of rooms together. There was a bedroom, a bathroom, a study room, and a stone room for meditation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Within the stone room were various arrays that had been carved from the stone. Hui Yue used swordlight to enhance his attack at the wall, but not even a scratch was left behind. Seeing this, he was quite shocked as he knew how powerful his attack was.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even though he was shocked, Hui Yue did not try to see if he had the power to break the wall; instead, he left and continued to examine his new chambers.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will retreat,&quot; the servant said neither humbly nor arrogant as he left the chambers. Using his soulforce to scan the area, Hui Yue noticed that the servant had stopped right outside of his door and was standing guard. It suddenly made sense why they were not humble. These experts were not servants; they were instead guards. Considering they were all placed in front of the doors, these were not guards of a low rank either.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue looked around and felt rather alone. Usually, when he was within a chamber or room, he would call for Huli to keep him company but for the next few years, it would not be possible to see any of his friends. The only one on his side that he could talk with was Pei Ze, and he was in his own room confined by a guard outside of his door as well.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh right, King Yanluo told us to write a letter to our sect,&quot; he mumbled as he entered the study where multiple books were placed on a desk with paper, pens, and ink.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sitting down, Hui Yue wrote down the most simple letter he could think about.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Dear elders, I&#x2019;ve passed through the first trial to become the new Judge of Hell. I will help look after Pei Ze and Pei Feng, but most importantly when you see me next, I will be the new Judge of Hell. Please say thank you to ancestor Pei Tian for me.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Finishing the letter, he knocked on the door gently before opening it. &quot;I finished my letter. Please have this delivered to head elder Ziqi of the Celestial Sword Sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The guard nodded his head in understanding before he called for another servant. This other servant was incredibly polite and bowed deeply as he accepted the letter. The two demons shared a few words before the servant nodded his head vigorously and went on his way.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The guard in front of Hui Yue&apos;s door showed no signs of leaving and since he had nothing else to say Hui Yue nodded to the guard once more before closing the door. He then started looking through the many rooms at his disposal.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Should he start reading the books and learn more about Netherworld and the rest of the galaxy, or should he enter the meditation room and start cultivating?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If he were to cultivate what should he focus on? Should he try to investigate the memories he had within his core and hopefully be able to merge with the memories of the wings soon?</p><p dir="ltr">Should he try and walk down the path of a new dao? Try to find a new dao to comprehend or should he try to comprehend the dao of space which was slowly opening up for him?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Thinking about all the possibilities Hui Yue sighed. &quot;There are many options, but the one most beneficial to me would be to merge with the memories of my past self from the Celestial Sword Sect. That will give me extra insight into the sect, but it will also allow me to use the bloodline of the great roc.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Not to mention this, I also have the mysterious star and the red gem.&quot; The gem had such overpowering defense, and its potential seemed limitless while the mysterious star had not even been used yet. If he somehow managed to get this star under control and could use it, then he would have another trick up his sleeve. One more technique that would help him survive and hopefully also help him rank as the first in these trials.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Then, that decides it!&quot; Hui Yue said determined as he moved into the meditation chamber. Sitting in meditation, he closed his eyes and entered his core where he found the many different memories of his previous lives.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, he reached out to the wings. He felt how they appeared on his back and slowly stretched; he felt power well up within his body and instantly felt a change from the last time he had summoned the wings.</p><p dir="ltr">Feeling the wings on his back, Hui Yue led his consciousness into these wings and felt that there were many secrets locked within. The moment he entered the wings the strength in his body multiplied many times over.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The bloodline of the great roc somehow needs something to be activated,&quot; Hui Yue sighed deeply, but he was unsure as for what it was he needed to do. Did he need the flesh and blood of a true descendant like the other descendants of the Celestial Sword Sect? In that case, he would have quite a few issues. His body had been born from mortals and was not born from descendants of the great roc, and thus he could understand if he could only command some of the power of the great roc.</p><p dir="ltr">Another possibility was that he needed to merge with the memories of his past life, the original Celestial Sword Sect member, before he would know how to activate his ancient bloodline.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Flapping his wings, he tried his best to merge with the energy that he could feel was hidden within. He tried his best to merge with the memories contained within so that they could truly merge with one another, but he was incapable of reaching the final steps. He was incapable of seeing the memory materializing into a figure within his core much less merge with him.</p><p dir="ltr">Sensing that he was as close as he could be, but still not close enough, Hui Yue could do nothing but sigh, and he considered shifting his attention from the wings to other memories within his core.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at the black figure, he felt greed in his heart. He truly wished to merge with this memory as soon as possible to increase his strength, but also to know about his previous life with Huli.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue wished to merge with this memory, he could feel that this memory held no friendly thoughts towards Hui Yue at all. The only reason it acted was for Huli&apos;s safety. The only moment it acted was when Huli would be affected in one way or another.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Merging with Hui Yue was definitely possible considering that this memory already had consciousness, but it was not possible since they were not going to agree on anything as things were now.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing, Hui Yue once again shifted his gaze. This time from the black figure to the red gem.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This red gem had caused Hui Yue great curiosity. How was it possible to become as physically strong as this red gem? His body was instantly as hard as a mountain, as hard to hit as a metal board.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Merging with this red gem, Hui Yue could instantly feel immense strength pouring through his veins. It was a strength that did not depend on the Ancestral Worldpower, but on the physical body alone. It was as if his body was made of a material other than Ancestral Worldpower, but could this really be the case?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue knew that not all creatures had bodies made from Ancestral Worldpower. The reason humans&apos; bodies were remade into bodies of Ancestral Worldpower upon becoming a God was that their mortal bodies were too weak to handle an immortal soul.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The bodies of beasts were not entirely made from Ancestral Worldpower; they were made from both their original bodies and then strengthened by Ancestral Worldpower.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Thinking this far, Hui Yue reached the conclusion that this was either the memory of some sort of magical beast or another kind of creature which had managed to become a God through cultivation. It was a body which was not fully formed from Ancestral Worldpower.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Merging with this red gem his body became solid, and even his aura became heavy as it pressed down upon anyone present. But was this all the red gem could do, defend Hui Yue&apos;s body? Was this the memories of a cultivator who had done nothing but train his body&#x2019;s defenses? &quot;This makes no sense,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself. &quot;Although his defense was great, and he was able to escape many calamities with such a defense, it is not possible for him to fight people with this strength alone. He needed to have cultivated some sort of dao. If I dig deeper into the memory of this red gem, perhaps I can find some daos that I have yet to comprehend!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pouring his consciousness into this red gem, Hui Yue started to comprehend the many thoughts that flashed into him. He saw broken memories of a massive mountain. He felt a warm embrace as if he were laying in a warm bed, but his entire body was covered with soil. Hui Yue noticed small broken memories and emotions from this previous life of his, but no matter how he thought about it, it was impossible to get any clues about what all this meant.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As he started to examine more memories of the red gem, he also suddenly felt a dao opening up to him. This was different from previously when he tirelessly trained to comprehend the dao. Now it all flowed into his mind with ease.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The dao of gravity! This dao was the dao of the gravity something which he could feel around him at all times.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he could ignore gravity and fly into the skies, there was no way he had previously understood just how powerful this dao was. With the insights he was gaining, he could now increase the pressure a thousandfold and directly explode the bodies of some experts if they were not strong enough.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even the strongest experts would be slowed when affected by a gravitational field, but he also learned how to allow himself to ignore gravity without using his Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p dir="ltr">Although he was comprehending the dao at a rapid pace, Hui Yue was still seated within the meditation room for a full sixteen days before he emerged. Coming out of the room, a light shone within his eyes as he understood the dao.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The reason he could so quickly comprehend this dao was clearly because he had comprehended it in his previous life, and now it was flowing into him like a stream of water.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had still not tried to contact the mysterious star within his core, but he was not in a rush to do so. He had already gained greatly, and everything had to be taken step by step. To calm down now, Hui Yue went to take a bath. Afterwards, he entered the study where he started reading through many of the books placed within the room.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the books were about the Netherworld. They told about the many cities within the Netherworld and roughly how many lived in each city. They also went into detail about the different City Lords.</p><p dir="ltr">When he reached Skydragon Fortress&#x2019; description, Hui Yue stopped for a moment as he saw the picture of the City Lord, and then he snorted. Although the City Lord had tried to kill him previously, he had failed, and now he had even failed at passing the first trial.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking his head, Hui Yue thought no more about the City Lord of Skydragon Fortress. In the future, he would no longer need to have anything to do with this greedy City Lord as Hui Yue would soar to realms far above his reach.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
