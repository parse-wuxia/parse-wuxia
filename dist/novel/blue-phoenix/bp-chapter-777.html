Some of them were rooted to the spot with disbelief while others rushed forward, but no one had been faster than Pei Ziqi.</p><p>Everything had happened so fast, that only the closest had noticed what had happened. The stabbing and the conversation between Hui Yue and Zhong Fai was quiet, and everyone present, apart from Hui Yue&apos;s friend and a few close experts, had not noticed what happened.</p><p>It was not before the heavenly dao started to descend from the heavens that everyone noticed that something was occurring, and while the side of humanity was feeling smug, the Blood Demons were rather unhappy.</p><p>Although one more heavenly dao user would not make a massive difference in the war, it was like a sign. The heavens were giving their blessings to the humans.</p><p>At the same time as Hui Yue was comprehending the heavenly dao of the heavens, he was also comprehending the major dao of light.</p><p>Hui Yue was so preoccupied sensing the changes that were happening to him that he did not notice that the entire world had gone silent and that even two Overlords were currently observing him.</p><p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; the demon Overlord asked curiously. Although they were enemies, he would not lower himself to deal with weaker experts, especially not when they were in a situation like this where Hui Yue had no chance to retaliate.</p><p>When the demon Overlord looked at Hui Yue, and he instantly noticed a few things. He could sense the phoenix sacrifice, but he could also sense his age and his strength. Even with a phoenix sacrifice, it had required a whole lot of lucky chances and perseverance to reach such a cultivation at this point in his life, especially since he had been a mortal before reaching immortality. This was the type of potential he had never seen before, and his eyes shone with greed.</p><p>If this boy could be transformed into a Blood Demon, then no one would ever be able to stand against them. He would at the very least have the strength of a Manor Lord, if not even be turned into an Overlord!</p><p>Yama understood his thoughts, but he could not help but snicker, &quot;That is Pei Yue.&quot; He introduced him. There was simply no reason to not inform the demon about who he was because he knew that even this Overlord had heard about Pei Yue.</p><p>And rightfully so, the moment he heard the name, the greed within the eyes of the Overlord dimmed. This young man was already rooted within Diyu&apos;s and humanity&apos;s faction. To turn him towards the Blood Demons would be impossible, and the only result he would get would be to constantly be wary of this person.</p><p>&quot;We should not continue talking!&quot; Yama said as he raised his weapon, &quot;We should fight one another, and settle this once and for all, one of us will not leave here today!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I could not have said it better myself. Charge!&quot; As soon as the words escaped the lips of the demon Overlord, chaos broke out.</p><p>Some of the Blood Demons charged as they had been told to, while surprisingly others turned and started slaughtering their own kind. It did not take long to realize that these people were all humans and beasts that had been turned into Blood Demons.</p><p>At the same time, riots erupted within the army of humanity. Some demons that had been standing amongst the others turned out to be traitors as well. They were Blood Demons all along, pretending to be on the side of humanity.</p><p>There were far more traitors amongst the side that fought for humanity than the ones that fought for the Blood Demons, and Hui Yue could easily guess why. The answer was simple; it was due to slave marks.</p><p>Many of the people who had been turned had had slave marks placed upon them, but they were quite smart. They rushed towards the Blood Demons that were within the army of humanity, clearly aiming for them. They had been ordered to charge and had to do so, but no one had specified who they should attack.</p><p>The hundred kilometers that were between the two armies was traversed quickly, and the air was filled with the sound of weapons colliding against one another. Daos made the air explode from colliding with each other, and tears in space appeared everywhere. Archaic Energy was starting to spread through the cracks and killed everyone it came into contact with.</p><p>The Archaic Energy did not care whether or not it was humans, beasts, or demons that it came into contact with because all of them would be corroded in short order and not even bones would be left behind.</p><p>On this battlefield, the only ones who would be able to survive coming into contact with this Archaic Energy were half-step Overlords and Overlords themselves. The half-step Overlords should be able to touch it for a brief moment, but not for too long.</p><p>A half-step Overlord did not depend on how many heavenly daos that they had comprehended. Heavenly daos had nothing to do with being an Overlord, just as it was not the number of major daos that determined whether or not one could comprehend a heavenly dao.</p><p>To become an Overlord and control Archaic Energy, one needed to have gained insight into the Great Dao itself.</p><p>There was only one great dao, and that was the dao that encompassed everything. To gain insight into this dao was the difference between an Overlord and everyone else.</p><p>Half-step Overlords were those experts that had gained an initial understanding of the Great Dao but still were a bit away from comprehending it. They had a slight amount of Archaic Energy, but not enough to be able to use it freely.</p><p>This also meant that when the two experts of the Overlord rank were facing one another, waves of Archaic energy would be released and anyone below the half-step Overlord rank that went near them would die.</p><p>Many experts died from the shockwaves at the start, but soon everyone learned to stay away from the grounds where the two Overlords fought, even the half-step Overlords did not dare encroach upon their fight.</p><p>Hui Yue noticed that the Alchemist God was fighting against one of the Manor Lords while Yanluo was fighting another.</p><p>The third Manor Lord, the one that Hui Yue had met before in the Divine Beasts&#x2019; memory, was fighting a demonic beast that Hui Yue did not recognize.</p><p>&quot;Everyone we cannot stay together!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed to his friends. &quot;Split up into groups and fight those you can win against. Don&apos;t go against too many or too strong an expert at once; survival is as important as killing the Blood Demons. You can only kill demons as long as you live!&quot;</p><p>They all nodded their heads and split up into groups. The first group consisted of Lao, Lei, Jo and Pei Ziqi. Pei Ziqi was aware that she was not strong enough to assist Hui Yue, and thus she decided to protect his family instead.</p><p>The next group was Xiao She, Huli, and Sha Yun. They were followed by Wei and threw themselves into the battle.</p><p>After them came Xiao Ning, Zhu Jun, Luo Qiang, and Ye Ling. Those four had been a team for so long, and they knew each other very well. Thus, they were like a well-oiled machine when they threw themselves into the melee.</p><p>After them came Su Xiaoyun, Wan Qiao, and Cai Jie. The three of them had not worked together before, but they quickly got used to one another as they rushed into the fighting.</p><p>Rong Ming, Rong Xing, and Deng Wu also stayed together as they attacked everything that came their way with purple eyes, not caring whether or not they were turned humans with slave marks or not. As Rong Ming said, death was also a kind of freedom for them.</p><p>Hu Yong was together with Shen Wei, Tang Tian, and Lu Jing while Jia Na went with Yan Lei, Zhong Li, and Mu Haolong.</p><p>Da Hu stayed together with the Western Tiger. These two had fought together for so many years, and now that they could be side by side, they would never leave one another&apos;s side again.</p><p>The ones who were left behind were then Hui Yue, Wang Ju Long, and Lan Feng.</p><p>These three had all comprehended heavenly daos, and thus they were going to fight against enemies of the same level. Having shared a soul, Lan Feng had also benefited from Yue&#x2019;s merger with the shining star, and now he too had comprehended the heavenly dao of life and the heavenly dao of the heavens.</p><p>&quot;Yue, don&apos;t be too complacent,&quot; Hui Yue suddenly heard a familiar voice from behind him and turned around to see his father, Pei Tian. &quot;I noticed that you comprehended another heavenly dao while the two Overlords were talking, but you have only comprehended two heavenly daos.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In this war against the Blood Demons, they also have some born with some amazing talents, allowing for them to comprehend three, four, or even five heavenly daos. It is much more difficult for the humans to comprehend that many daos, but we can at least continue to push forward. Our side does have some old monsters who have comprehended quite a bit of heavenly daos as well so fear not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Also, I know you have heard about the blood princes, but the Blood Demons also have their grand elders as well. They are retired blood princes or Blood Demons who did not wish to become blood princes for one reason or another. They are just below the Manor Lords in strength, and they are to be looked out for.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now I have warned you, don&apos;t go get yourself killed!&quot;</p><p>Having said this, Pei Tian sighed and ruffled Hui Yue&apos;s hair before he flew away, on the hunt for his very own demons to kill.</p><p>Hui Yue and Lan Feng who had been filled with excitement about their newfound strength felt like someone had dropped them in cold water, their expectations suddenly changed drastically.</p><p>&quot;Well we can only hope we don&apos;t meet the most dangerous ones,&quot; Hui Yue sighed. &quot;We have already fought before, and we will be able to fight again. There is one thing though; we need to find An He. He has evaded us time and time again. I wonder if his demonification has become complete,&quot; Hui Yue mused, and Lan Feng&apos;s eyes turned darker as he felt the anger rising.</p><p>&quot;That is correct,&quot; he said. &quot;This war is serious, but there is something even more serious for us. We need to deal with An He before he can cause even more problems.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue and Wang Ju Long nodded their heads, and the two of them moved forward towards the Blood Demon army. It was clear that An He would be hiding amongst quite a lot of the Blood Demons, not allowing for anything to threaten him.</p><p>Since this was the case, Hui Yue, Lan Feng, and Wang Ju Long did not care about face as they killed any demon that came across them, being a heavenly dao cultivator or not.</p><p>Hui Yue knew that this battle was the final battle and thus he hid nothing. He held the Celestial Sword in his hand, and blood drops kept flying around him.</p><p>This was true carnage. The air was thick and filled with blood, the heavens were turning slightly red, and the energy of death was everywhere. It was heaven for Wang Ju Long and her heavenly dao of death.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
