He knew that this child in front of him was a formidable opponent, but he was also aware that he was still just a small child.</p><p>Although he was likely in control of more daos than Hui Yue, it was obvious he could be easily manipulated when it came to his emotions.</p><p>The other Blood Demons knew that this child was at a disadvantage when it came to fighting Hui Yue, but they trusted him with their life.</p><p>He was a blood prince! There were only seventy-two of these blood princes that the blood demons had, and thus they had to have quite an astonishing power to achieve such status.</p><p>He was also their immediate superior. If they did not listen to him and moved to assist him against Hui Yue, it was likely that they would be punished after the battle was won.</p><p>So, instead, they all headed for Hui Yue&apos;s friends while promising themselves that they would keep an eye out on Hui Yue and their prince&apos;s battle. If things went awry, they would instantly come to his assistance no matter the consequences.</p><p>The beasts were eagerly awaiting these demons.</p><p>&quot;So which one of you is Joker?&quot; Jia Na asked with an excited voice. He liked this kind of eccentric personality, and he wished to fight him to see which one of them was the strongest.</p><p>An expert emerged from the masses of Blood Demons and looked at Jia Na with contempt in his eyes. &quot;A stupid snake wants to stand against me?&quot; he snorted, &quot;It would only be fair if I fought you all at once!&quot;</p><p>Although he was arrogant, there should have been a limit to his arrogance, but there was not. Lao and Jo looked at one another, and a snicker appeared on their lips. Their thoughts were in sync; they were siblings after all.</p><p>&quot;We will all fight Joker. Use all your strength to eliminate him and then we will move on to the next person and then the person after him!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about their attacks?&quot; Xiao Ning asked worried, but Lao just smiled knowingly as he looked at the much larger, burly man.</p><p>&quot;We will split up, half of us are on defensive, the other half work on killing one expert after another. We have Pei Ziqi, Wei, Cai Jie, Huli, and Lan Feng. They are not much weaker than father, so they can easily handle two of these buffoons at once.&quot;</p><p>Everyone looked at Lao and Jo in astonishment as they were enlightened by their genius. They were correct. Although Hui Yue was not fighting by their side, they were in no way weak. They were all strong in their own right, and they had the benefit of numbers.</p><p>&quot;Okay, I will take the one who looks like a clown, and the one who is standing there gaping like a fish,&quot; Pei Ziqi said as she pointed at two of the Blood Demons. One of them frowned, and the other instantly shut his mouth after hearing her words. Both of them were enraged and embarrassed at the same time.</p><p>&quot;Woman you think you can deal with us?!&quot; the fish demon said with a high pitched voice filled with anger and slight fear.</p><p>However, although he was angered to the point of speaking in a shrill voice, he was still the real deal. He was a Blood Demon that had been able to fully dominate every human he had come across so far, and when he charged forward followed by the clown demon, Pei Ziqi&apos;s face turned solemn. Her hand grasped her battle axe hard, and the daos started to superimpose themselves on top of her weapon and her body.</p><p>Seeing these two Blood Demons charge forward, everyone else rushed into battle as well. Lan Feng, Cai Jie, Huli, Pei Ziqi, and Wei noticed that there was not even enough for them to fight two each, and thus only Pei Ziqi and Lan Feng dealt with two at a time. Of the rest of the five other demons, one was dealt with by Wei, one by Cai Jie, and one by Huli while the final two were being harassed by all the beast Gods and Hui Yue&#x2019;s friends.</p><p>Hui Yue had long since started the battle against the blood prince, and he could not help but laugh lightly in his heart. This child truly had no experience fighting others, and although every one of his punches carried a certain weight and power, they were not able to break through Hui Yue&apos;s defense of superimposed daos alongside his supreme refined body.</p><p>Seeing this, the child was enraged further. He understood that he had lost the initiative when he charged towards Hui Yue, but even when he used all the daos at his disposal, it impossible for him to break his opponent&apos;s defenses.</p><p>Hui Yue continued to exchange blows with the child. Although he was able to avoid receiving injuries, he soon found that his opponent&#x2019;s hits were becoming harder and harder, fiercer and fiercer.</p><p>At the same time, Hui Yue noticed that the child was not focusing on Hui Yue, but on the dao that had superimposed around him and his heart grew cold.</p><p>The child was no longer in a rage, instead, he had a serious expression on his face as he observed the dao. Ever so slowly the dao of the child also started to show signs of superimposing itself.</p><p>&quot;He is a monster!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed in shock as he understood that this child was truly worthy of being called a prince of demons. He had been born with a great constitution and five major daos, and at the same time, his ability to understand the dao was unheard of before. He was able to understand superimposition just fighting against Hui Yue.</p><p>This left Hui Yue worried. If the battle continued, then he was likely to lose the only advantage he had, the ability to superimpose the daos. If the child learned it, then he would have one dao more than Hui Yue, making it possible for his daos to penetrate and wound Hui Yue. If this happened, it would be near impossible for Hui Yue to get through his defenses.</p><p>Fortunately, this child had still not completely understood how to superimpose the dao, and thus Hui Yue still had the chance to fight back, but he knew the time to do so was limited.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Hui Yue no longer snickered or chuckled at the child at his silliness. He understood that all of these blood princes were incredible in their own right. Even a child like this one was potentially dangerous.</p><p>&quot;And here I thought I had what it took to defeat An He already,&quot; he mocked himself as he shook his head.</p><p>He had used the dao of fire, wind, darkness, and earth and superimposed them on each other. He knew that he had to drag out every single power he could use, and he reached out to the shining star within his core.</p><p>He felt another two daos the dao of light and the dao of time open up to him. Although he had not understood them well enough to superimpose them on the other four, he still used it to change the flow of time around him.</p><p>Hui Yue launched himself forward, the sword twisted in his hand and with every move swordlight beamed towards the young cultivator.</p><p>This swordlight was reinforced with Hui Yue&#x2019;s compressed daos, four of them, and they were able to penetrate every defense at the same level as four superimposed daos or below.</p><p>Seeing the swordlight coming at him, the child did not dare be negligent. He faced the attack with a serious expression. Darkness wrapped around him and windblades chopped towards them.</p><p>Although these windblades were incapable of blocking the swordlight, there were thousands of them, and as they broke one after another, they managed to weaken the swordlight slightly.</p><p>Not only did his windblades manage to slow the swordlight, but they bought the child the time he needed to narrowly move out of the way of Hui Yue&#x2019;s attack.</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s eyes twitched slightly as they saw how the child managed to escape the swordlights which he had poured his daos into.</p><p>But this was a life and death battle so although Hui Yue had used some of his energy; he was not going to give up and resign himself to death. He felt the dao of light becoming increasingly clear in his mind and soul, and the more he fought, the more insights into this dao he was gaining.</p><p>The dao of time was a minor dao under the dao of light, and this dao was as powerful as the dao of space and the dao of devouring. It was considered a minor dao, but the strength of it was almost comparable to a major dao, and when one controlled these daos, they could increase their combat ability many times over.</p><p>Hui Yue had comprehended the dao of space, the dao of time and the dao of Devouring.</p><p>The dao of space and the dao of devouring were both daos he had gained incredible insights into due to his previous lives, and of these three daos, the dao of time was the one he had the least impression of. This was because he still had not connected with the shining star, but he could feel that when he comprehended it, he would gain a great increase in his strength.</p><p>&quot;Although my strength will increase when I am able to fully control the dao of light, I am not weak now,&quot; he said to himself through clenched teeth as he gripped harder on his sword. Steeling his determination, he looked at the child in front of him.</p><p>Neither of them attacked after the swordlight missed the child, but both just looked at one another. Hui Yue had a somber expression on his face while the child looked very self-satisfied.</p><p>&quot;Are you trembling in fear yet?&quot; he mocked, &quot;I am smarter than most of my peers, and when I have learned the legendary technique to superimpose the dao, I will shoot up the ranks! I will be at least ranked fiftieth if not better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You speak as if you have already won,&quot; Hui Yue chuckled, but his eyes were serious.</p><p>&quot;That is a foregone conclusion,&quot; the child said arrogantly as he looked at Hui Yue as if he were looking at a dead man, but Hui Yue just shook his head. The child was losing his focus again now that they were not fighting. Hui Yue felt that the more arrogant this little prince was, the harder it was for him to understand the principles of the superimposed daos.</p><p>&quot;Good luck then,&quot; Hui Yue shook his head with a small smile on his face not giving the child any face, and this caused him to be even more annoyed, but the child was aware that he could no longer lose his cool if he wanted to win this fight.</p><p>&quot;Enough talk! Get ready to die!&quot; the child said as he threw a punch that was infused with the dao of darkness and accompanied by the dao of wind, metal, water, and fire.</p><p>All of them were used at the same time, and they had touched the threshold of being superimposed, but they had still not been reduced to their purest form, their essence, and hence they were not as powerful as Hui Yue&#x2019;s.</p><p>Hui Yue spread out his senses as he felt the attack approaching. He flicked his hand with the sword a few times and shot out seven swordlights. All of them were aimed at the weak points in the attacks made by the prince. As the many attacks arrived in front of each other, Hui Yue&#x2019;s managed to pierce the defenses around the small boy, and a scream escaped the child&apos;s throat as his leg was cut open and blood flew everywhere.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
