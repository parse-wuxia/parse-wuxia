He was clearly pleased with Hui Yue&apos;s priorities.</p><p>&quot;Well, thank you for all the help you are giving us,&quot; Yanluo said with a smile as he stood up from his chair. &quot;Follow me, and we will go visit old King Chujiang right away. The sooner his soul gets strengthened, the better.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue did not hesitate and instantly stood up as well. Nodding his head, he followed behind Yanluo as they left the big hall.</p><p>They took some of the same corridors Hui Yue had walked through towards the hall, but then suddenly they entered another area of the mansion. This section was quite different from the previous ones he had been in.</p><p>Here it was dark and gloomy. There were no sounds of servants in this wing of the mansion, and the windows were covered by heavy curtains.</p><p>The atmosphere was heavy, and the air was filled with soul energy. All this soul energy was twisting and churning, and it seemed as if it was being dragged in the same direction they were headed.</p><p>&quot;Since we do not have a miracle medicine such as the Nirvana Phoenix Flame, we have tried to mend his soul using soul energy,&quot; Yanluo explained as he continued forward, not even turning around just letting his voice drift to Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;Although killing souls is a crime punishable by death, many souls perish every day, and the majority of this soul energy is under my control. Gathering it here is no hard feat, and allowing for King Chujiang to consume it is better than just letting it flow freely outside.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even though I have forced much of the soul energy here, there is still so much soul energy in the rest of Youdu that one wouldn&#x2019;t notice that I have summoned most of it here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, this energy can only do so much. Although many Gods lose their lives in Youdu, their souls escape to the Yellow Spring or get refined into souls for consumption. The soul energy which we can use is mainly from mortal souls, and it cannot do too much for a wound as serious as King Chujiang&apos;s.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We had hoped that it was enough, and because of that we did not contact you, but after realizing that it was not our only option left was to ask for your help.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head, and soon they reached a door where Yanluo stopped and gently knocked.</p><p>&quot;Enter,&quot; a tired voice sounded from within. Yanluo instantly opened the door and allowed for himself and Hui Yue to enter before he closed it behind them.</p><p>The moment they entered, Hui Yue noticed that it was incredibly dark inside.</p><p>There were no windows in the room, and the only dim light that entered was a small line of light coming from underneath the door frame.</p><p>It took a short while for his eyes to adjust to the darkness and when he did he was shocked. In front of him was the madame of the second court whom he had met before, and she was holding a ball of mist in her hands.</p><p>This ball of mist was clearly the soul of King Chujiang. It was constantly absorbing the soul energy in the surroundings, and it was switching shape constantly.</p><p>&quot;His soul was wounded before it entered the Yellow River,&quot; Yanluo explained. &quot;We haven&apos;t been able to converse with him to learn exactly what happened. All we know is that his soul was wounded and he is not conscious. His soul is just barely alive and trying to mend itself on its own. As of right now, we cannot even push it into a body.&quot;</p><p>The more Hui Yue was told, the more he understood what was going on. Looking at the face of the madame who was holding her husband&#x2019;s soul in her hands caused Hui Yue to know her pain. It was the exact same he had felt when he held Wang Ju Long&apos;s injured soul in his hands.</p><p>&quot;I will help you,&quot; he said decisively as he reached into his core where the Nirvana Phoenix Flame was located. He pulled out a small wisp of energy and held it in his hands.</p><p>The closer he came to the soul, the more it started twisting and changing shape, it was as if the soul was reaching out for the wisp of Phoenix Flame.</p><p>Hui Yue continued to walk forward with the wisp of flame and slowly placed it right in front of the soul which jumped at it and greedily consumed it.</p><p>A shiver ran through the soul, and slowly the soul ball took the shape of a face. This was the face of a middle-aged man. His eyes were closed, but his features seemed kind. It looked as if he was asleep, but the soul energy surrounding him continued to pour into him. As time passed, more of the Nirvana Phoenix Flame had been absorbed and the clearer the features of the middle-aged man became.</p><p>&quot;I think we will need more than one wisp,&quot; Hui Yue said with a frown. Not because he cared about the Nirvana Phoenix Flame, but because he could see that the soul of this King Chujiang was seriously wounded.</p><p>&quot;Well, in a month I will give him another wisp of Nirvana Phoenix Flame,&quot; Hui Yue continued, and he saw how the tense shoulders of the madame instantly relaxed. &quot;I will be staying here in the mansion until his soul is completely repaired.&quot; He continued and both Yanluo and the Madame seemed excited about this turn of events.</p><p>&quot;I want to ask you a question though,&quot; Hui Yue felt his own heartbeat quicken. &quot;I have fed Nirvana Phoenix Flame to Wang Ju Long&apos;s soul for the past fifty years, once a month, but even so, she still has not awoken. Her soul should be complete again, but her eyes will not open, and she will not respond to anything that I say.&quot;</p><p>This was something that had troubled Hui Yue quite a bit, and he had been worried for a long time. Even if he had to use a favor to get an answer, he truly needed to know.</p><p>&quot;She will not awaken before she gets a body,&quot; Yanluo said with a sigh. &quot;The souls will awaken when they get placed in a body again, especially a weak one like her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you create a body for her, just as you did for me?&quot; Hui Yue asked again, his heartbeat rising, and Lan Feng also listening intently. If he could create a body for Wang Ju Long, then he could also create a body for him.</p><p>Yanluo contemplated for quite some time, unsure of how to answer. &quot;I can make a body for both your girl and your phoenix friend. However, I would prefer not to. The girl is not a God, and to put her inside the body of a God will cause problems between her soul and the body, which might be detrimental to her future.&quot; He sighed for a moment and frowned again. &quot;I can make a mortal body for her, but that would be a mortal body without any cultivation. She would have to regain her cultivation herself once more. Of course I can gift her a Silvermoon&#x2019;s Pill, but in the end, she would still have to become a Saint once more and then from a Saint to a God.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And the second problem with creating a body for your phoenix friend is that he is a beast. I can create bodies made out of pure Ancestral Worldpower which is what humans use, but to make one which is part flesh and meat, part Ancestral Worldpower, even I cannot form such a body.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The only way to get such strong bodies is to refine them with alchemy. The bodies I can make can be made as temporary bodies for the two, but they will lose power compared to how they are now. I really don&apos;t think it is worth it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But, if I refine a body for Wang Ju Long, will she be able to use it considering she is not a God just yet?&quot; Hui Yue was confused, and Yanluo nodded his head. &quot;Refined bodies are special.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are similar to beasts and humans&#x2019; bodies. First, you have a human, their bodies cannot handle the Ancestral Worldpower, and thus their soul creates a new body made from Ancestral Worldpower.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Second are the beasts. Their bodies are more sturdy, and they are able to infuse their flesh and bones with Ancestral Worlpower which make it so they can keep some of their fleshy body, making their bodies stronger than the ones of average humans.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finally you have refined bodies. They are not made from Ancestral Worldpower at all, but they have no limit to the amount of Ancestral Worldpower they can contain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since they are not created from Ancestral Worldpower there is no problem with them and her soul, although you need to wait for her to become a God. You can use the Formation of Life or whatever that formation is called in the Divine Beast World.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s head was spinning as he heard what was said, and he understood that he had to make an important decision. Should he give Lan Feng and Wang Ju Long temporary bodies? That would cause them to lose some strength and might not be the best for their future, or did he want to wait until he could refine the best bodies for them... It was a hard decision.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
