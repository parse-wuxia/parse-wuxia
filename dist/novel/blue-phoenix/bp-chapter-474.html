He could feel how it greedily absorbed all of it, and he could feel a change in the ground. The connection he felt became stronger and more powerful.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue became a little feeble from using an excessive amount of energy, he also felt a new strength within him. This strength was vastly inferior to the lifeforce he was using up, but it was still there. The more lifeforce he used, the stronger this energy became.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The ones awake on top of the mountain, felt tremors run through the realm, and suddenly some of the spatial cracks that had appeared in the sky started to close. They had not vanished, but a few had become smaller. The air now seemed much fresher than before. Energy waves were appearing from somewhere under the ground, and if they had been able to see what was happening in the rest of the realm, they would be shocked.</p><p dir="ltr">Every change was minuscule; no miracles appeared, but the heat in the land had lowered some. The jungle which they had seen when they arrived was no longer red but was turning green, and lava was no longer flowing as freely as before.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was stuck underground for a full three months, and in this time significant changes happened in the realm. By the time Hui Yue returned to his body, he was quite weak and dizzy. Looking around, he found that all the spatial cracks in the sky had disappeared; all the lava had returned underground, and the air was no longer scorching hot but comfortable. The dense air of Ancestral Worldpower and essence of the heavens and the earth had diminished somewhat. It now felt much more like a place one could inhabit.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Small shoots could be seen in the red soil everywhere; the land had gained so much lifeforce that Hui Yue had almost none left for himself. This was the reason that he instantly sat down to cultivate. It was not possible for him to meditate and restore the lifeforce as he could only restore it by harvesting from the dead, but he could get rid of the feeble feeling he was experiencing.</p><p dir="ltr">No one rushed him. They all waited for Hui Yue to finish his cultivation while they too spent their time cultivating. Although the Ancestral Worldpower and the essence of the heavens and the earth were diminishing there was still enough for them to cultivate. It was still much denser than in other worlds such as the Divine Beast World.</p><p dir="ltr">The Gods all stood in a circle around Hui Yue and his friends. Although they knew that there was no one other than them in this realm, they still took their job as protectors incredibly serious. Especially when their new master had become so weak after fulfilling a request of theirs.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue woke from his meditation and looked at the realm around him, the look in his eyes changed drastically. Before he had been fascinated by this broken realm, and the things it contained, but now Hui Yue looked at it with tender eyes. This realm had become a part of him, and right now it was like a weak baby. It was unable to protect itself and in need of a parent to look after it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue felt his parental instincts awaken. Whenever he thought of how the realm had been nourished by his lifeforce, he felt his heart grow warm. When he saw the plants sprouting on the ground and the rain dripping on the warm, cracked soil, he became happy. This realm was like a stray dog which had finally found its owner, and a connection had appeared between the two.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the realm was a living creature, it was not able to think, but it had emotions and instincts. Feeling the tender care that Hui Yue showed it, the realm was delighted. It had wanted a Sovereign ever since the Vermilion Bird left and went into his eternal sleep. Thinking like this, Hui Yue guessed that the divine beasts had left many broken realms behind, but right now there was nothing he could do about them. He was already busy with both the Divine Beast World and this nameless broken realm.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had a small smile on his face, as he looked at the many Gods who were following him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have merged successfully with this realm, and I agree that there is a small increase in strength, but comparing it to the lifeforce I lost nourishing it, the price far exceeded the gains. I understand that in the long run this will change and I am grateful you gave me the chance to look after this realm. In the future, this will be our base when traveling to other worlds. This will be our new home.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s words made them all feel good inside, and Deng Wu was elated. He had been dreaming of having a secret base, and now it seemed that they were actually getting one.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We need to bring Xing and Ming here.&quot; He said excitedly, and Hui Yue could not help but laugh. &quot;We will show it to all our martial brothers and sisters.&quot; He agreed with a smile.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is a realm; it is not a real world, nor will it become a real world before it gets its own formation. Even after we get a formation for it, it will have to evolve on its own to be considered a true world.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;For now we are not in a rush to make this into a world, a realm is good enough. We can slowly nourish it and build an amazing formation. We do not need this realm to become a heavenly world but one day I want it to look after itself and not solely rely on my lifeforce.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We need to place the Formation of Life in the Divine Beast World since this world is to become one of the top heavenly worlds in the entire universe, and to do so we will remove it from this world. I will be able to sustain this realm through my lifeforce, but we will need to create a formation of some kind for this realm to be able to create its own essence of the heavens and the earth.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone nodded as they heard what Hui Yue said. If this were to become their home then it was obvious that they needed to take good care of it. To make it into a world would be their ultimate goal.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master Hui,&quot; The bull called out, and everyone turned to look at him. His respectful way of speaking greatly shocked Hui Yue and the others. Just as Hui Yue was about to ask how he could be considered the master of such strong allies, the bull continued speaking.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;All of us are Primordial Immortals, at most Immortals of Creation.&quot; He said respectfully. &quot;The first God rank is the Primordial Immortal level. This was the rank you, had until the moment you merged with this realm. After cultivating within this dense energy of Ancestral Worldpower for thousands of years, a few of us managed to breakthrough and became Immortals of Creation.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;As an Immortal of Creation we just barely have the energy to create worlds, hence the name. The God rank after Immortal of Creation is the Sovereign level, and after the Sovereign rank is Crowned Sovereign.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Sovereigns and Crowned Sovereigns are different from Primordial Immortals and Immortals of Creations. This is because anyone can become Sovereigns as long as they have successfully merged with a world, or a Crowned Sovereign if they have merged with one of the high ranked worlds.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That is to say that there are some freakish Immortals of Creation who are stronger than even Crowned Sovereigns normally but when the Crowned Sovereigns start drawing on the energy of the world they are connected with then they will gain much more power.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This also means that you, when taking over the Divine Beast World, will become a Crowned Sovereign, but never forget the fact that you are in fact merely a Primordial Immortal. Your personal strength is only so-so among us Gods, and you cannot depend too much on the Divine Beast World.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Every time you use the energy of the Divine Beast World it comes from the world&apos;s lifeforce. A world cannot harvest lifeforce; it can only gain it from being nourished either by its inhabitants, which takes time, or by the Crowned Sovereign directly.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Relying on the Divine Beast World just one time will result in thousand or tens of thousands of people dying from starvation. This is because the world will lose the energy it needs to create grains and crops, and also the energy needed to keep the weather in balance.Only use this as a final option. For now, you should focus on stabilizing your foundation and cultivation base as a God and increasing your strength.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have nothing more to do in this small realm, but we have been told to return the Formation of Life to the Divine Beast World. What are your plans now?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Upon hearing the question, everyone curiously at Hui Yue. What were his plans now?</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It&#x2019;s quite simple.&quot; Hui Yue sighed. &quot;I want all my friends to become Gods before we start leaving this world. Bringing Emperor or Saint ranked experts with me is not possible, and therefore we will need to spend quite some time in the Divine Beast World.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I own a mansion, and I plan on spending some power to create a chamber underneath this mansion and place the formation there.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am not going to leave this world before I am strong enough to carry the entire Divine Beast World within my Universe Box so that anywhere I go, I will carry the world with me.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The reasons I have decided to take the world with me is simple. First, I saw the memories of the Demon Lord and understand that he is going to take revenge on our world eventually. When he comes to take revenge, it is best if the world has vanished.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Secondly, I am going to implement the Formation of Life in the Divine Beast World which will make the essence of the heavens and earth thicken so much that the world will skyrocket in the rankings. It will definitely be noticed by other Gods, and they will covet this world. Taking it with me will prevent people from finding it.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thirdly, I need to bring it with me for my own safety.&quot; Hui Yue continued, and with every argument, the Gods kept nodding their heads. &quot;When I say my safety, I say so because when merging with this realm I understood that if something were to happen to this world, I would be severely injured too. I am the core, and obviously, whereas I am able to affect the world, the world is equally able to affect me.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The Gods all nodded their heads and straightened their backs. &quot;There is no reason for us to stay within this realm any longer. You should be able to place it within your Universe Box, and then all of us will return to the Divine Beast World.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head and summoned forth the Universe Box. Looking at this glowing box in his palm, Hui Yue smiled slightly and started to fuse his mind with the world around him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Enter!&#x201D; He thought out loud. After a second, the realm seemed as though it were twisting, and it became transparent entering the box. As everyone watched the realm disappear, they were left standing in a pitch black room.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
