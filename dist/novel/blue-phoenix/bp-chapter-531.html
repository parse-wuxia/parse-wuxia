Their eyes were locked onto the approaching three men and even Huli was ready to take action.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t be too scared, we just wish to hear about your ancestry,&quot; the second of the three experts said with a slight smile. He could not help but feel that it was quite amusing that this group in front of him was considering attacking them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My ancestry?&quot; Hui Yue frowned, &quot;I was born in a small world called the Divine Beast World,&quot; Hui Yue said honestly, but he did not go into details about his parents.</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing that he came from a minor world, the three frowned for a second before they looked at Hui Yue once more, &quot;Tell us about you parents.&quot; One of them commanded causing Hui Yue to just shrug his shoulders.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My parents are just two ordinary humans; both are currently at the King rank after swallowing Silvermoon&apos;s Pill. Before then they were both Disciple ranked experts.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I don&apos;t know much about my parent&apos;s heritage; I only know that they live in a small village and keep a low profile.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I was born as an ordinary human and spent my life struggling to increase my rank. At some point along the way, I realized that I could summon these wings on my back. I assume they are the reason you are interested in me no?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The arrogance in Hui Yue&apos;s words made the three experts frown but none of them said anything, they just continued to observe him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You seem to be walking down the dao of space, but when I look at you, your Ancestral Worldpower is quite weak. It seems you just became a God recently,&quot; the third expert said after a short break. Hui Yue nodded his head, &quot;Yes, I became a God less than a decade ago,&quot; he said honestly.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In less than a decade, you have already comprehended this much of the dao of space... Interesting.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The three experts were very curious about Hui Yue and the fact that he had the innate wings of the Celestial Sword Sect when his parents were just ordinary humans.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will need to discuss this matter with the elders,&quot; the first expert said to the two others, and they nodded in agreement.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Afterwards, they paid no more attention to Hui Yue and instead walked towards the City Lord. &quot;We appreciate the invitation to the banquet, but due to unforeseen complications, we will be leaving early.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Without waiting for a reply the three sprouted wings similar to Hui Yue&#x2019;s and flew out of the banquet hall.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at them leaving Hui Yue sighed in relief. He was not ready to be mixed up with the Celestial Sword Sect just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&#x2019;s leave as well,&quot; he said to his friends and turned to the sour-faced City Lord. He bowed respectfully and once more apologized for the fact that they had appeared at his banquet in such a manner.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the City Lord truly wanted to force Hui Yue to stay behind so that he could kill him, he knew he could not act now against this survivor from the battle against the new talents four and a half years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Faced with this situation, the City Lord had no other option than to send him a rather unpleasant smile and nod his head. &quot;Please, young hero, if you have any free time in the future then come visit me,&quot; was his last words, and Hui Yue snorted on the inside. On the outside, though, a brilliant smile appeared on his face as he nodded his head, &quot;I will remember your kindness.&quot; He said politely, and his words caused a chill to run down the City Lord&#x2019;s spine.</p><p dir="ltr">For not the first time, he regretted that he had decided to attack this man in the first place.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Leaving the mansion, Hui Yue&apos;s back was soaked in sweat. Although the strength his friends around him possessed was not to be looked down upon, he knew that if the City Lord truly wished to keep them from leaving, then it was not certain that they could win the bloody fight. Especially not if the memory of the black figure stayed as quiet as it had recently.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing deeply in relief, Hui Yue was happy as they left the City Lord&apos;s mansion. Instead of heading straight for an inn, Hui Yue led everyone to a high-class restaurant.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It&#x2019;s time to eat!&quot; Hui Yue smiled at the others, and they all were filled with excitement. As they reached the restaurant, Hui Yue flicked his hand, and ten Worldpower Stones appeared which he gave to the waiter. It was quite an extravagant tip, and the waiter seated them at a VIP table which overlooked the entire restaurant.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&#x2019;s eat till we are full! I&#x2019;ll pay. We will explain the main differences between the Divine Beast World and the Netherworld, and we will discuss what our next steps will be. I don&apos;t think we should stay in Skydragon Fortress for long; I suggest that as soon as we have eaten, we start our journey towards Diyu!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue said this with longing in his voice. Diyu was the first stop on his trip to resurrect Wang Ju Long.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;These dishes are all quite interesting,&quot; said Jia Na, the monstrous sea creature which had turned into a green-haired young man.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well I know that I want to try and eat these deep sea fish,&quot; Yan Lei, the big turtle, said with a nod of his head. Hearing his words, the majority of the beast Gods nodded their heads as well. Hui Yue and Huli picked something else, but soon they had all ordered their food.</p><p dir="ltr">While waiting for the food, Huli and Cai Jie answered all the questions that the beast Gods had about the Netherworld. Sometimes Hui Yue would ask a few questions too, and by the time they finished their meal, all of them had a good grasp of the world they now resided in. They also had a general idea of the strength the majority of Gods had and how different levels of power were ranked.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The beast Gods had been terribly shocked when they realized that their knowledge of the dao was severely lacking. Though they were rather happy hearing that they were gifted when it came to controlling and gathering Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&#x2019;s find somewhere to buy a map of the Netherworld and then we can head to Diyu,&quot; Hui Yue said. He paid the bill with some of the many Worldpower Stones he had gained from the Universe Box, and the group quickly slid into the busy street.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the street was busy, many people chose to move out of the way ensuring that this large group of experts could move as they pleased. No one in their right mind was willing to fight such a large group of experts, and even though it was illegal to fight in the city, no one knew if this group of experts cared about these rules.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who was walking in front, with Huli hanging on his arm, could not help but smile slightly. It was a little embarrassing to walk with such a large group of Gods, but at least it made him feel safe.</p><p dir="ltr">After moving through town for some time, they reached a small dusty shop which was filled with parchment and maps scattered about.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Curious, Hui Yue looked at some of the maps and found that there were even maps that spanned the entire galaxy! Seeing this, he knew that finding a map that would cover the Netherworld would not be difficult.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; an old voice asked, and turning around, Hui Yue saw an elderly man sitting behind a mountain of parchment.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am in need of a map of the Netherworld,&quot; Hui Yue said politely. As he looked at this elderly man, he could not sense even the slightest hint of energy or Ancestral Worldpower from him. It was clear that his strength was far above what Hui Yue could contend with.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Are you one of those children looking to go to Diyu? Are you ready to part with your little life?&quot; he asked with a chuckle.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing his words, Hui Yue was stunned, but he still nodded his head to display that he was indeed going to Diyu.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;For you youngsters, I am certain that the allure of becoming a Judge of Hell is amazing,&quot; this elderly man said with a smile on his face, &quot;but be careful. Diyu is not a simple place. The trial will not be anything you expect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at this man, Hui Yue felt that there was something he could not see through, but he still nodded his head seriously as he listened to the words spoken by the elder.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am not here for the sake of becoming a Judge of hell,&quot; Hui Yue said honestly with a sigh. &quot;I am here for the sake of a friend of mine. I need to meet Yanluo, or I will die trying. I am merely a weak God, and there is no way for me to meet him except this trial.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was unsure why he was telling this old man the truth, but he had a good feeling about him, and he felt that lying would not be good.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see,&quot; the elderly man said while contemplating. It was clear that he was somewhat surprised by the words the white-haired young man had said.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In that case, I will give you a map of Diyu for free. I hope that you do not waste your life and get to meet Yanluo.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Thanking the man, Hui Yue accepted the map. He cupped his hands and bowed deeply to the old man. &quot;Thank you for your help and guidance,&quot; he said sincerely from his heart.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After which he and the others left the map shop and looked at one another. Excitement surged in their eyes as they got ready to move towards Diyu, the place where everyone who wished to participate in the trials would gather.</p><br></div><p></p>
