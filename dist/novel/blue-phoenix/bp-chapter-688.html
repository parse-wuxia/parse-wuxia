There was no enmity between them, but there was quite a bit of tension in the air as neither felt secure being the first to rush into attacking.</p><p>Although striking first had its benefits, it also came with downsides. For instance, the moment one executed a move, one would also expose their weaknesses that the opponent would be able to exploit to their greatest benefit.</p><p>Huli truly was a sly, old fox. She had lived for countless years, and she was a true opportunist. If she really went all out then although Hui Yue had more major daos than her, he was not certain about his chances of victory against her.</p><p>Huli simply had much more battle experience than Hui Yue. She had grown into her strength a long time ago while Hui Yue was constantly increasing in strength and had not had the time to fully get used to his newly obtained strength.</p><p>Still, this was exactly what Hui Yue wanted. He wanted for Huli to fight him seriously. Although the two of them would refrain from using lethal attacks, they could still use anything else they had at their disposal, and it was likely that they would both get wounded from this friendly fight. But it was the only way that Hui Yue could understand his newfound strength.</p><p>Flipping his hand, the Sword of Icy Tempest appeared in his palm.</p><p>Just as he was about to attack, a paw came crashing down from above, and he managed to raise his sword just in time to deflect five razor-sharp claws that had descended with tremendous speed.</p><p>Sensing danger, Hui Yue did not even look around, but instantly leaped to the side only to see that the position where he had stood before had been completely shredded by a barrage of wind blades. There were so many that even space itself started to tear and small gaps formed which very slowly mended back.</p><p>Hui Yue had fallen into a disadvantageous position as Huli kept pressuring him with one attack after another. Her tails whipped up the winds, and she used this wind as camouflage for her attacks.</p><p>There was no wind previously in the arena, and therefore Hui Yue knew that every time he felt the winds, it would mean that a new attack was coming his way, but now the wind was blowing constantly, and not just from one side, but from all sides at the same time.</p><p>All nine tails sent tremors through the ground whenever they landed on the arena, and suddenly Hui Yue smiled as he reached out and sensed the dao of earth.</p><p>Against the dao of wind, the dao of earth did not have many benefits, but it still had some.</p><p>Hui Yue started off by making walls all over the arena floor. These walls blocked the wind, and he hid behind them while using his soulforce to sense what was happening on the other side, not allowing for Huli to attack him while he was blind.</p><p>The next thing he did was to cause much stronger tremors to run through the ground. He wanted to cause Huli to lose her balance, or at least interrupt her constant attacks, but he had underestimated the power of a perfect body and the power of a beast.</p><p>Huli did not have soulforce, so she was unaware of which wall was hiding Hui Yue, so she just went for the first that came into sight, and smashed her paw down on top of it instantly smashing it to smithereens.</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s eyes widened when he saw how easily Huli dealt with his preparations to slow her down.</p><p>Still, Hui Yue was not one to give up. The gravity on the arena suddenly increased a thousandfold, and a rumble sounded out as Huli&apos;s legs and paws dug into the arena surface by a full thirty centimeters. This kind of pressure was definitely not something that one could look down upon.</p><p>Hui Yue smirked as he left the safety of the wall he had been behind so far. He reached out to the dao of fire and the dao of wind. At the same time, he created three formations that hovered in the air, one of them being the Ten Suns formation further strengthened by the dao of fire.</p><p>The Ten Suns formation was one of his best techniques. He knew that if this formation could not bring trouble for Huli, then he would truly be in dire straits, but as soon as the fire appeared, Huli just snorted.</p><p>She was a Black Nine-tailed Fox. A creature which had quite a bit of resistance towards fire, but even so, Hui Yue was certain that the flame within the Ten Suns Formations was violent enough to even leave her with burns.</p><p>A sword slashed, a claw descended. Flames erupted from the back, and wind blades cut through the flames, and the arena descended into chaos.</p><p>Hui Yue had the advantage of three major daos, while Huli had the advantage of being familiar with her perfect body and having grown into her strength.</p><p>Regarding battle ability, the two of them were actually quite close, but when it came to their potential, Hui Yue had the upper hand.</p><p>During their spar, Huli could easily feel how Hui Yue was being molded. He was getting familiar with his body, and how to fight an opponent as strong as himself.</p><p>Huli knew that if she wanted to win, then she would have to display some of her actual beastly abilities but all of those were killing moves. Although she had great trust in Hui Yue, she was not willing to take the risk. One moment of negligence would mean his death.</p><p>Just as she thought this, Huli felt how the air around her froze. She felt how it was impossible for her to move as everything turned still.</p><p>Hui Yue walked slowly towards her, a smile on his face. He placed the sword at her throat saying, &quot;I win,&quot; as he smiled happily, and Huli nodded her head. Although she had lost, she did not feel bitter in the slightest.</p><p>Hui Yue released the spacelock formation that he had created and smiled at Huli. &quot;You gave up rather quickly,&quot; he said, but he understood why. If this were a battle to the death then it would have turned truly ugly, and it was impossible to say who would end up as the victor, but this was not a life and death battle, so it placed some restrictions on them.</p><p>&quot;I could have broken free of this spacelock formation, but I did not have the heart to,&quot; Huli smiled wryly. This spacelock formation was a representation that the man she loved was truly a part of Hui Yue, and this was something she wished to see as many times as possible.</p><p>Although the sparring had ended quickly, it had still given Hui Yue some pressure, and he had gotten more used to his body. He could feel that his performance had peaked, but he also knew his skills were far from the apex.</p><p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you fight me?&quot; a voice sounded. All of them turned to the side where they found the Alchemist God standing with his hands behind his back and a smile on his face.</p><p>&quot;I promise not to bully you, but you will have to use your full power if you want to avoid being severely injured,&quot; the Alchemist God spoke casually, but his words were serious.</p><p>Hearing this, Hui Yue felt his blood start to boil, and he was eager to test out the Alchemist God&#x2019;s strength. Even if he were severely injured, it would at most take a month before he was fully healed due to his perfect body and the many pills they had at their disposal.</p><p>&quot;Please!&quot; Hui Yue bowed deeply and smiled as he jumped into another arena. The previous one was rather broken after his battle with Huli. Remnant walls were all over the arena and footprints alongside cracks littered the surface.</p><p>While the Alchemist God slowly flew up on the stage, Little Green joined Huli, Sha Yun, and Wang Ju Long to the side. The four women all smiled and chatted with one another while paying attention to the battle that was about to start in front of them.</p><p>Hui Yue hesitated at the start again. Allowing for the Alchemist God to make the first move would be a bad as he knew that he would fall into a disadvantageous situation, but he also knew he would be displaying his weaknesses. If he did that, then there was no chance the Alchemist God would be as forgiving as Huli had been.</p><p>Hui Yue instantly reached out for the dao of earth, and the gravity once more increased a thousandfold, but looking at the Alchemist God, it seemed as if it did not affect him whatsoever. His feet did not even sink a millimeter into the ground.</p><p>Instead of wasting his energy on keeping up something that had no effect, Hui Yue canceled the gravity he had increased, and instead, focused on making some more walls.</p><p>He hid beneath one of them and started moving his seals to create the Ten Suns formation, and while he did so, his soulforce was spread across the entire arena. He could feel how the Alchemist God was moving closer and closer to him.</p><p>He took one step at a time heading towards the wall Hui Yue was hiding behind. The Alchemist God was moving at a casual pace, but for Hui Yue, this pace was as fast as a cheetah. He was worried if he would be able to successfully craft the formation before the Alchemist God was before him.</p><p>Hui Yue was not dumb. He knew that there was no way that he could kill the Alchemist God, no matter how much he tried, and since he could not kill him then he had no reason to hold back.</p><p>&quot;The dao is split into the minor daos, the major daos, and the heavenly daos,&quot; the Alchemist God started talking. Hui Yue, who had focused fully on creating the formation started listening to what the Alchemist God had to say.</p><p>&quot;In this galaxy, the ones who have comprehended a heavenly dao are a very minor group. I think at most there are around five experts who have comprehended a heavenly dao.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Being an Overlord and having comprehended a heavenly dao is not the same. I have comprehended a heavenly dao, but, sadly, I am currently unable to take the final step and become an exalted Overlord.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I could give up my cultivation base and become a constellation now that I have comprehended a heavenly dao, but I am not willing to create a world and lay down my legacy yet.&quot;</p><p>The Alchemist God was speaking about the secrets of the heavenly daos and the overlords, almost as if they were not in the middle of fighting, but Hui Yue was aware that an attack would rain down on him the moment the Alchemist God reached him.</p><p>His ears were piqued with interest as he listened to every word the Alchemist God was saying, but he did not dare to delay the creation of his formation. It was clear that he was teaching his disciple many deep secrets of the galaxy.</p><p>&quot;A heavenly dao is completely different than a major dao. When you control a major dao you can control the weather - you can level a mountain and split the seas; however, when you control a heavenly dao, you can command the life and death of others with nothing but a thought. You can change their fate with a wave of your hand. You can raise mountains with a finger and shatter the heavens with a fist.&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
