But looking at his brother, it was clear that he did not feel the same way. Sighing, the second ancestor found a chair to sit in and looked at his older brother.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Tell me, what kind of miracle had to occur that it would save his life and let him be reborn with the bloodline of the great roc. And then if that were not unlikely enough be born as someone without memories to mortal parents.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The second ancestor asked as he spread out his hands making it clear that he had no idea how it was possible. In response, Pei Tian just shook his head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There could be many different reasons. He could have been injured, and his cultivation base wounded forcing him to become a mortal. It has happened before, and it will definitely happen again. He could have entered this Divine Beast World and have hibernated for thousands of years before he finally dreamt all that happened and awoke.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Another option is that his body was wounded and his soul managed to escape. You know that our bodies are made from Ancestral Worldpower. This means that our bloodline is not merely physical but is in the soul as well. Therefore if one of our souls were to take over a new body, then we would still be a descendant of the great roc.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My theory is that he was gravely wounded and his soul fled from a dreadfully powerful enemy. He has fled for thousands of years, so his soul was weakened more and more as time went by, and eventually, he fled to a mortal world where his soul was most likely seeking a place to rest. It was probably then that he felt something familiar, even if this familiarity was nothing other than a name.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;At this point, he would have lost almost all his memories and would have become nothing more than just a soul focused on fleeing after so many years. Finally, when a stillborn baby was born to the Hui family, his soul descended into this body and took over. The fact that he was named Hui Yue was heaven&apos;s will!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Having the soul of a God, this baby would have been baptized with Ancestral Worldpower at birth which is why he is so talented. The reason he can understand daos, such as the dao of space, is because he has already spent so many years traveling through space as a soul. Although every memory has vanished, his body remembers these things!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The more Pei Tian spoke, the more astonished the second ancestor became. After some time he nodded his head, his mouth still open slightly along with a stunned expression present on his face.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That&#x2026; That actually makes sense,&quot; he said dumbfounded. &quot;If he were really a new God, it would be simply impossible for him to comprehend the dao of space at such a young age. However, since he has been traveling in space for seventy thousand years, it is definitely possible.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;His facial features, which apparently doesn&#x2019;t look like his parents would also be explained this way,&quot; the second ancestor continued. &quot;His face would indeed look the same because of the soul and body merging; his hair turning white would be because of the trauma of being a soul for so long.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But there is still one thing which I do not understand,&quot; the man continued. &quot;What of his dual bloodlines? If he really is your son, then dual bloodlines should not be possible. Your wife was a human, not a beast, and his parents in the mortal world were also both humans. It&#x2019;s still odd...&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pondering for a while, Pei Tian stroked his beard before he nodded his head, &quot;Do you remember that we once tested whether it was possible to give our bloodline to other experts? Experts that were not born into our family? Every time we tried, the experts would explode because the bloodline was simply too powerful for normal cultivators, but perhaps the bloodline of this red wolf was not as powerful as the bloodline of the great roc; therefore, he somehow got introduced to it while fleeing through space.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It makes sense that he does not wish to go into details of his past as he does not wish for his new parents to experience problems. Because of this, it was easy to hint that his parents were a wolf and a descendant of the great roc and they left him. But, I need to know more details! If he was truly born from these two human mortals, then I am a hundred percent sure that he is my son!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There is also another reason that I am so sure he is my son,&quot; Pei Tian continued. &quot;There are three members of the second generation, you, me, and, older brother.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The last hundred years neither of us have left the Celestial Sword Sect. Tell me, how is it possible for us to have offspring in the mortal plane of the Divine Beast World less than fifty years ago when we have never been there? He has to have a much more mysterious origin and everything points towards him being my son.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Having thought this far, the second ancestor realized that what was said was actually correct. It was true that to have a third generation descendant, the second generation needed to have a child, but none of them had a child anytime recently. Even more so, none of them had even left to be capable of making this child, so where had he come from?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The ancestor, who at first had thought that his older brother was going insane because of grief from losing all his children, was now starting to believe in the fact that this young man was indeed Hui Yue. The son who had gone missing around seventy thousand years ago.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We need to tell older brother your theory,&quot; the second ancestor finally sighed, and Pei Tian nodded his head. This was indeed very important for the future of the young man who now had the name, Pei Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The two ancestors instantly descended from the mountain and headed towards the palace where the patriarch was residing. It was very rare these days for all three of them to be gathered together, but this sudden emergence of a third generation descendant was definitely an important enough issue to bring them together.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they arrived at the palace, everyone hurriedly retreated from their presence and allowed for them to walk through the mansion as they saw fit. Finally, they arrived at an office where the patriarch was seated.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Older brother,&quot; they both said respectfully as they bowed to him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have a theory that we think you might want to hear about. It is about the third generation descendant who has appeared out of nowhere.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on top of one another, the two brothers explained their theory once more, and the expression of the patriarch turned surprised and then excited. He too started to feel that this explanation could really explain this odd event.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I just need to send some experts to the Divine Beast World and then meet with his mortal parents,&quot; Pei Tian repeated his words from before. &quot;If I manage to find them and find out for sure that they are his blood-related parents, then I know for sure that he is my son!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The eager and hopeful expression on his brother&apos;s face made the patriarch sigh deeply as he shook his head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sadly, I have already sent someone to the Divine Beast World. I made them take the transmission arrays, so they arrived quite quickly, but they reported to me a major problem,&quot; he said as he felt a headache coming his way.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;According to the knowledge that we could gain within a few days, the Crowned Sovereign of the Divine Beast World had recently changed, and shortly after, the world vanished from our galaxy. No one knows where it is nor what happened to it,&quot; he sighed, causing the two ancestors to look at one another with deep shock and disbelief.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There is no way the world simply vanishes just like that, but I remember that the Alchemist God once created an item which could supposedly hold an entire universe. This is the only item ever made which could store an entire world and it is called the Universe Box. It is a peerless treasure that many experts have gone crazy for year after year, and even now after the Alchemist God has long been missing many experts explore small worlds in the hope of encountering his treasures.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Are you telling me that this new Crowned Sovereign of the Divine Beast World happens to be in possession of the Universe Box?! Then we should instantly start a manhunt to get our hands on this divine item! Do we have any information about who the new Crowned Sovereign is?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The second Ancestor was filled with excitement as he thought about the Universe Box, but then he saw that the expression on the patriarch&apos;s face was rather complicated.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I know who the new Crowned sovereign is. As a matter of fact, you guys know him too; it is none other than our little Pei Yue.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The two ancestors gaped in shock as they heard the words that the patriarch had spoken and silence reigned in the room for some time. After processing this new information, Pei Tian finally cleared his throat, &quot;You said that little Yue is the one who became Crowned Sovereign of the Divine Beast World? But he is a new God! How could he be a Crowned Sovereign? How could he possibly possess the Alchemist God&#x2019;s Universe Box?!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I honestly don&apos;t know, but the information we have should be correct,&quot; the patriarch said with a shrug. &quot;We cannot try and take the universe box from this younger generation member, and we should never again mention this to anyone.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding their two heads, the ancestors agreed to not say anything. This, if it were true, it was absolutely shocking! If Pei Yue had managed to get his hands on so many treasures at such a young age, it would really make even them cough up blood from jealousy.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The original Pei Yue was not all that amazing, but after having been reborn, he was indeed rather amazing. I cannot wait to see just how many wonders he will bring us.&quot; The patriarch said with a smile on his face, and the two ancestors nodded their heads.</p><p dir="ltr">Although they had wanted the Universe Box, the life of their nephew was many times more important to them than an object made by the Alchemist God.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Silence once more descended upon the room as they all went quiet and thought about how many surprises Pei Yue had brought them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It seems that your son will bring with him tremendous benefits to our sect this time,&quot; the patriarch said praisingly, and Pei Tian nodded his head proudly. &quot;The only thing I hope is that he will remember his old memories so that one day he will remember me as his father,&quot; the old man sighed. There was nothing he wanted more than to have his son recognize him; it was truly agonizing to be so close but yet so far away from one another.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The two brothers looked at Pei Tian with sympathy. They had lost many of their children as well. However, some of them still lived, and they were not alone much like Pei Tian was. They wished for him to be reunited with his son once again.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
