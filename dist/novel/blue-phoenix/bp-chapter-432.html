It was created by the four divine beasts as the navel of this world. It is the array which condenses the essence of the heavens and the earth and also the reason why we can be considered one of the top worlds in this universe.&quot; Zhong Fai explained, his eyes glistening with excitement as he leaned forward in the chair explaining.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;If one enters the Formation of Life they will be surrounded by Ancestral Worldpower. This Ancestral Worldpower will slowly disintegrate the body of the expert inside the array, but while the body is disintegrated the soul will be nourished. Their body will become one with the world around them, and they will transcend to the God rank.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;It is not only Saints who can enter the formation, but weaker experts can also though they will need to stay quite a bit longer within as their soul will need a lot of strengthening. It is very painful and hard to manage. Still, I am unsure if it is more or less painful than using Silvermoon&apos;s Pill so perhaps you could let your beloved children attempt it. I assume that you will definitely try out the Formation of Life yourself. The stronger your ability to comprehend the world around you the quicker the process will be.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Zhong Fai was quiet for some time after he finished speaking, and Hui Yue was quiet as well thinking about what had been said. This Formation of Life seemed to be outstanding, but why would the Frozen General need him. Even sharing the information about the Formation of Life was quite a surprising move. Hui Yue was worried why he had been told. What was the reason?</span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing the frown on Hui Yue&apos;s face, Zhong Fai guessed what he was thinking causing him to sigh. &quot;I told you that I am an Ice-Serpent. I cannot enter the Central Palace. No matter how much I want to, it is simply impossible for me to do so.&quot; Zhong Fai said with a regrettable shake of his head.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I can enter the Dungeons of the Divine and the outer parts of the Central Palace, but the middle is protected by the energy of the four divine beasts who created this world. To be able to remove the Formation of Life one needs to be a God.&quot; Pausing for some time, Zhong Fai sighed. &quot;I want you to enter the Formation of Life, become a God, and steal the formation so that I can use it too.&quot; He sighed. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I know that you owe me nothing, and stealing the formation is not going to be easy, but you can find the formation with the information I have given you. When you become a God, consider it as doing me a favor, and I will come when you need help; even if it means fighting An He and his Generals. As a God, I believe in my ability to deal with one of his Generals. I am a divine beast after all.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing his words, Hui Yue was stunned and uncertain about what he should do. The allure of the Formation of Life was almost too much, but Hui Yue was aware that it would not be simple.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I will help you.&quot; He said slowly. &quot;But I will not rush to get my hands on the formation just yet.&quot; Hui Yue said, and his words made the Frozen General both elated and understanding. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You are smart.&quot; He said nodding his head. &quot;Although it is possible for weaker experts to enter the formation it is indeed very hard to reach it. As it is the center of the world, it is the most protected place. And even worse, right now it belongs to An He. He allowed for his four followers to use the Formation of Life to become Gods. Their talents were quite limited, but they are his most loyal followers. Because of this, he is not someone we can easily deal with.&quot; Zhong Fai said with a sigh.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;If it belongs to An He, how will it be possible for me to get my hands on the formation without him getting in the way?&quot; Hui Yue asked with a sigh. Although he was tempted by this wonderful formation, he was not willing to risk his and his friends&apos; lives. Being alive was more important than reaching the God rank sooner.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry too much about An He and his guardians.&quot; Zhong Fai promised, &quot;An He hasn&apos;t been back here for a few hundred years, and he has no interest in staying in this world. His aim is to become the sovereign on of a Heavenly Realm.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Three of the four Generals are with him currently. The last, and weakest, is still here in the world, but he is not in the Central Palace. No one would know that you got your hands on the formation.&quot; Zhong Fai promised.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Had An He actually still cared about this world then he would not have let the beast army take over Siban. Ironically enough, he does not like beasts; he looks at them as though they are nothing but slaves, food, and things for entertainment.&quot; Zhong Fai laughed, &quot;but he only cared about this place back when he had just reached the God rank because this world made him into a Crowned Sovereign. From the moment he joined the ranks of the Gods, he instantly became a Crowned Sovereign. This caused his strength to soar to the heavens. Even though he was a mere Primordial Immortal, he still had the support of a top-tier world.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;He is most likely in closed door training somewhere. He is probably either planning on building his own world using this as a template or learning new arts that make it possible for him to fight other Crowned Sovereigns. Either way, he will be busy building his own strength and doesn&#x2019;t have time to deal with this small world. We just need to watch out of the one General, and he should not be close to the Central Palace. Although they are Gods all of them are merely Primordial Immortals. Truth be told, they are afraid of &#xA0;the powers of the four divine beasts and their many traps which are within the Central Palace.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;So you&#x2019;re telling me that the Gods are fearful of this area but I, an Emperor should enter?&quot; Hui Yue said with a dry smile on his face, and Zhong Fai chuckled embarrassedly. &quot;I feel that you might be able to deal with the challenges better than these Gods.&quot; He laughed, and Hui Yue nodded his head. If it had something to do with the four divine beasts, Hui Yue believed in his powers, not because of himself but solely because of his relationship with Lan Feng. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I suggest you do not enter the Central Palace until you are at least a Saint.&quot; Zhong Fai said with a sigh. &quot;Although I wish for you to go sooner rather than later, rushing will never give me the results I want.&quot; He complained, &quot;and with your current cultivation speed I know you will reach the Saint rank soon. Since I have already waited for as long as I have, waiting for you to become a Saint will not be a loss for me.&quot; Zhong Fai said. &#xA0;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue nodded his head and looked a Zhong Fai for some time. If he truly managed to become a God and gained possession of the Formation of Life it would be possible for him to allow his friends to become God ranked experts as well. It would even help Xu Piao become a God and reunite with Xie Lan who was his best friend and the love of his life.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Everyone went quiet for some time. They thought about the amazing abilities this Formation of Life offered. It would thoroughly change their lives if they got their hands on it. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Will it not change this world if I remove the formation from the Central Palace?&quot; Hui Yue suddenly asked and his question caused Zhong Fai to frown and after a while shrug. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I really don&apos;t know.&quot; He said honestly, &quot;in theory nothing should happen as long as the formation is within this plane; however, if it were removed from the plane then it would probably be impossible for this world to keep creating essence of the heavens and the earth. This would then become a world where it would be almost impossible to cultivate.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing this, Hui Yue was reminded of his old life back on earth where cultivation was something which was none existent, and he shook his head. He could no longer imagine living in such a world, and he would never let this world become like that. Even though he would borrow the power of the formation, he would never take it away from the world.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I have a question, which might be quite off our current topic.&quot; Hui Yue suddenly said, and his words caused Zhong Fai to look at him curiously. &quot;I have a friend who is a necromancer; he has been experimenting with controlling corpses and becoming a puppeteer, but he is not able to control more than a few at a time. How are you able to create the Frozen Army?&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing the question at first the Frozen General was taken aback, but after a moment he started laughing out loud. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Necromancer? Haha, right it would look as though I am a necromancer to the outside world!&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Although I am a divine beast and have elemental affinities, I am no necromancer. I am an Ice-Serpent, a serpent which is capable of creating parasites. Each and every one of these parasites are capable of taking over the body of a person.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;These parasites can grow stronger depending on the talent of the expert they consume. That is why I have always been hunting down talented experts. The parasites freeze the body to keep it from rotting, and as soon as the parasite is within, the body will perpetually frozen. They are the perfect soldiers. Even if they lose limbs, they will keep fighting. These parasites come from me, and thus are completely loyal.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;But although I have many frozen soldiers in my army, I also had quite a few people who are experts who have sworn their allegiance to me. One such expert is Zhong Hei, who I picked up when he was a very small child. Another is Su Ge, my right-hand man. Being around the parasitic soldiers for too long is boring because they cannot speak and only follow orders.&quot; He grinned, and Hui Yue nodded his head. This was an innate ability of the Icy-Serpent and this it was not an ability that could help Deng Wu, even so, Hui Yue was going to tell Deng Wu about the situation. It was possible for him to perhaps create an ability from this situation much like Hui Yue had managed to create pills and abilities inspired by other things he had experienced.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I will be returning to my Frozen Palace.&quot; Zhong Fai said with a nod. &quot;There is no need for me to stay here within the capital city while you are training. When you finish you can either come find me at the Frozen Palace or go directly towards the Central Palace where you can get your hands on the formation.&quot; Zhong Fai said before he stood up. &quot;Thanks for wanting to cooperate with me.&quot; Zhong Fai said gratefully. &quot;I also want to allow three of my followers to become Gods alongside me, and all four of us will owe you a favor for this. I look forward to the day of my ascension.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Having finished talking, Zhong Fai stood up and with a nod towards the two others he turned to leave. Just as he was about to pass by Hui Yue, he placed a hand on the younger man&apos;s shoulder and with a serious expression on his face and a grave voice he said. &quot;Make sure to take care of Sha Yun. She is a wonderful woman who deserves attention.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">The words left Hui Yue completely stunned, and Zhong Fai left the room with a smile on his face while Sha Yun&apos;s face had turned beet red.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
