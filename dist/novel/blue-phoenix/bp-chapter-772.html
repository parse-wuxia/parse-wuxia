Some were looking at the now unconscious young master from the Zhu family while others were gaping at Hui Yue.</p><p>The attacks that the Zhu young master had displayed were all magnificent. They had swordlight and flair, but he had still completely lost, and what stunned these experts present was that not even one of them were able to determine why exactly he had lost.</p><p>Hui Yue had mostly just stood there. Only at the end did he take a step forward, and at the same time, the young master of the Zhu family had been pushed away at a rapid speed, like a kite that had its string cut for no apparent reason.</p><p>They had all felt an oppressive aura at that moment, but was just one&#x2019;s aura truly strong enough to cause such damage? Auras were only auras after all.</p><p>Hui Yue said nothing to explain; he just looked as casual as he had before as he walked towards the unconscious young master.</p><p>He then flipped his hand, and a small pill appeared within. This pill was then dropped into the open mouth of the young master, and few moments after, the unconscious man awoke. His face was now healthy in color, and it was clear that he had no lasting or severe injuries as some might have feared since he spat out blood.</p><p>In fact, the young man had an incredulous expression on his face. &quot;I feel much better than ever before!&quot; he exclaimed shocked as he checked his body and Hui Yue just chuckled.</p><p>He had fed him a Pill of Clarity. These pills were the ones he had the most of and giving one away was no problem at all.</p><p>Although the Pill of Clarity was not a pill that healed the consumer, it was a pill that allowed for the person who ate it to connect with the dao easier.</p><p>The more of these pills one ate, the less effective they became, and he and all his friends had been eating them like candy. As a result, none of them benefitted from this pill any longer.</p><p>It was different though for this young master. He was not a young master of one of the major families or sects of the galaxy; he was just a talented individual from a family within the eastern region. Thus it was impossible for him to get his hands on a Pill of Clarity, and even if there was one up for sale, he could simply not afford it.</p><p>Since this was the case, he was completely untainted. He felt how the dao was now surrounding him. Sensing that this was the perfect time to cultivate, the young master immediately sat down in meditation, and the elders of the Zhu family all gathered around him.</p><p>The only one who knew what the young master of the Zhu family had been fed was Hui Yue, but no one feared that he was using underhanded means as he simply did not need to do so. If he wished to kill any of them, it was clear that they stood no chance.</p><p>Having seen Hui Yue&apos;s performance, all the girls present blushed as they started evaluating themselves and their chances of hooking up with this young man. The young men also started looking with admiration at him. They wished that if they could get even just a tenth as strong as this guy, then they would have reached their life&#x2019;s goal.</p><p>Since the exchange of pointers had ended, Hui Yue left the training field together with his friends. They were led back to the mansion by the same servant who had led them there in the first place.</p><p>Before he had been polite and very friendly to Hui Yue because he knew he was a talented genius from the Celestial Sword Sect and Diyu, but now he was genuinely admiring him from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>In this dog eat dog world, strength was truly what determined one&apos;s real worth, and only by displaying this strength was it possible to achieve heartfelt admiration.</p><p>Since Hui Yue had displayed his strength today, everyone was filled with admiration towards him.</p><p>Some had even recorded the fight with memory stones, and these recordings started making their way out of the Su family and into the rest of the eastern region. This allowed for all of them to understand just how vast the difference between the geniuses of the eastern region were to the geniuses of the main sects and families of the galaxy.</p><p>Returning to the mansion, Hui Yue spent the rest of the time half in meditation and half together with the patriarch of the Su family.</p><p>He also wrote a few letters which he sealed with Ancestral Worldpower that contained the promises he had made to the Su family previously.</p><p>During these few days they were in the Su family, no one saw Su Xiaoyun. She was spending all her time together with her aunt.</p><p>At the beginning, she had been asked many questions about how she had managed to become friends with such outstanding cultivators, and soon Su Xiaoyun had told the entire sequence of events to her aunt, leaving out only the details where she felt it could jeopardize her promise to never betray Hui Yue and his friends.</p><p>After this, they just spoke about the past, about their lives together, and about their future aspirations.</p><p>Su Xiaoyun did not mention where they were heading after this, as she did not want her aunt to accidentally reveal it to the wrong person, but she did explain that she wished to reach the apex. She wanted to become a cultivator that was acknowledged for her strength and not just her appearance.</p><p>Having suffered from being disfigured by a Blood Demon, Su Xiaoyun understood that although she had always been poor, she had been fortunate in the start because of her pretty face. This allowed her to gather lots of heroes to her side, but when she was disfigured, not even one person was there for her, apart from her aunt.</p><p>Now that she had reclaimed her charming appearance, she still wished to be acknowledged as a genius. She wanted to have people fearing her power, and at the same time, show the Su family that they too had someone strong in their family.</p><p>As the day where they were to depart arrived, they all said their goodbyes. Most of the friends had been waiting patiently for this day since they had nothing to do here in the Su family&#x2019;s residence. But for Su Xiaoyun, it was different. She would be gone for a long time, but she did not even shed a tear.</p><p>Su Xiaoyun was a strong person. She had made up her mind to leave with Hui Yue long ago, and she was, as a result, completely steady when they finally left the world belonging to the Su family.</p><p>The Zhu family had been there for as long as Hui Yue was. They had been conversing a little with Hui Yue when the opportunity presented itself, and they felt that they too had gained something valuable.</p><p>They had especially understood that the Su family were valuable in Hui Yue&apos;s eyes, and as long as this man was alive, then they vowed to treat the Su family with much more consideration and care than they had done so far.</p><p>The shuttle appeared in the void just outside of the Su family&apos;s world, and as everyone settled into their rooms, it shot forward towards their new destination, Diyu.</p><p>Although they were traveling rapidly, even at a speed that was unrivaled in the entire galaxy, it still took them a full three months before they reached Diyu.</p><p>During this trip, they had been cultivating and trying to comprehend other daos, but they had also been on high alert.</p><p>Hui Yue was perfectly well aware that the Blood Demons would not let him be.</p><p>He had killed so many of their princes, and this was something they would not let go. Now it was no longer just enmity between Hui Yue and An He; now it was between Hui Yue and the entire Blood Demon faction.</p><p>But contrary to Hui Yue&apos;s expectations, nothing happened on their trip. They did not even come across bandits. It was clear that all those who previously had been bandits were now lured towards the attractive rewards that were being promised to those that hunted Blood Demons.</p><p>After three months they reached Diyu painlessly, but just as they were about to reach the Netherworld, Hui Yue noticed one major difference from when he was there last.</p><p>Last time it was possible to easily enter the world, but now experts, both demon and human, were guarding the world. It was impossible to enter without being examined.</p><p>Hui Yue, arriving in such a massive shuttle, clearly drew a lot of attention and two groups of guards arrived next to the shuttle looking menacing and threatening as they inquired about their purpose.</p><p>&quot;I am Pei Yue,&quot; Hui Yue introduced himself, but he soon found that these guards did not believe him.</p><p>&quot;What can I do to make you believe?&quot; Hui Yue asked slightly annoyed. Suddenly, he thought about it and took his communication orb out and contacted Yanluo.</p><p>It had to be said that it was quite rare to get in contact with Yanluo the first time one tried to communicate with him, but this time it went straight through, and the guards who had blocked Hui Yue&apos;s entrance suddenly turned frightened. They paled and were filled with fear.</p><p>Hui Yue snorted, but he was not in the mood to punish them. Thus he just continued forward after he had been confirmed to be Pei Yue.</p><p>As soon as they arrived in Diyu, Hui Yue could instantly feel the difference from last time he was there.</p><p>The soul energy that was everywhere was much denser than ever before, and at the same time demons were much more focused than before. Now demons were rushing back and forth. Some were carrying things while others were empty-handed, but what all of them had in common were serious expressions on their faces.</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s face turned more and more grim the closer to Youdu they came. He soon found that this capital had the most intimidating auras that he had ever sensed, and he understood that he was not the only heavenly dao master who had come to Youdu with the intention of talking to Yanluo.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
