These four daos together with the Celestial Sword created a large beam of swordlight with every slash, and each could massacre more than fifty experts.</p><p>Hui Yue was astounded by the sword&#x2019;s performance. The sword left a trail of blood in its wake, and although fifty experts seemed small out of a million cultivators, it was really quite a lot from a casual strike.</p><p>The demon&#x2019;s purple eyes narrowed dangerously, and a chill passed through his entire body. Hui Yue was no ordinary four dao Immortal of Creation. Every expert could control more than one dao at a time, but to be able to superimpose them, layer them on top of each other, was truly difficult.</p><p>&quot;I am still lacking strength,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled as he searched inside himself. He found the star and his arm reached out to grasp it.</p><p>As soon as they came into contact with one another, Hui Yue felt how the dao of time, the dao of light, and another much harder to comprehend dao started to revolve around him.</p><p>This vague dao that he could not feel was impossible to use in combat, but the dao of light and the dao of time were able to be superimposed on top of the other daos and his strength suddenly surged upwards once more.</p><p>Now that the dao of time was mixed in with the dao of darkness, and thereby also the dao of space, Hui Yue could slay a hundred demons with a flick of his sword.</p><p>For the demons, it felt as if time stood still whenever the swordlight was heading towards them. They felt as if space had become muddled and their every move was in slow motion.</p><p>The swordlight was as fast as sound itself and before they could do anything they had already been cleanly sliced in half.</p><p>Each and every one of these strikes were actually not aimed at the lower ranked demons. Although they were troublesome and annoying, they did not possess the ability to make Hui Yue so much as glance at them.</p><p>The strikes that massacred a hundred demons each were all aimed at the demon lord that had comprehended four daos. This supreme expert, the demon lord, was able to barely avoid every one of the attacks. He managed to merge with the wind and make use of its short-range teleportation. Instantly moving to another location where there was wind, merging with the wind, and hoping that the swordlight did not reach him there.</p><p>While taking such actions, the demon lord could only grit his teeth. Every time he was escaping he knew that a large number of lower ranked demons would be slaughtered. Even so, his life was far more valuable than even a million low ranked demons.</p><p>&quot;I should flee,&quot; the demon lord mumbled to himself, but he was filled with fear. Every time he tried to escape his path was blocked by fierce swordlight, and as Hui Yue gathered momentum, he was capable of releasing multiple swordlights at a time.</p><p>&quot;Wei is still struggling,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled as he sent a quick glance around the battlefield. It was clear that fighting was going differently in different areas.</p><p>Lan Feng was relying on his absolutely strong defense from the new body he had gained, and he was simply shrugging off all the minor attacks. He allowed for them to land on his body but he would completely ignore them.</p><p>At the same time, he would send attack after attack at the five experts in front of him. He controlled four daos, and although he did not have enough control to superimpose the daos the way that Hui Yue had done, Lan Feng could use all four daos simultaneously and was constantly becoming more and more ferocious.</p><p>His sharp beak and razor-like claws had already left several wounds on every single one of his opponents.</p><p>Pei Ziqi was also able to hold her own. She was not able to leave as many wounds on her opponents as Lan Feng was, but her heavy battle axe was constantly in motion and brought with it a tremendous power which kept pushing back the two experts she was up against.</p><p>Her dao was filled with chaos, and a constant feeling of murder permeated the air around her. Even the normal Blood Demons who were unafraid of anything felt worried and hesitant whenever they went to attack her.</p><p>Pei Ziqi was also able to superimpose her daos, but it was not before now that Hui Yue realized that this was what she was doing and the reason for her supreme strength.</p><p>Her entire body was clad in the superimposed dao just like Hui Yue&#x2019;s sword was. Every single attack that was aimed at him or her would be negated by their daos. It was impossible to break through the defense of four daos unless one controlled one or more heavenly daos.</p><p>Pei Ziqi had not comprehended as many daos as Hui Yue and Lan Feng had, but she had a deeper understanding of their uses in actual combat.</p><p>Since Hui Yue did not have to spend his time worrying about Lan Feng or Pei Ziqi, he sent a single beam of swordlight towards the two experts that Wei was fighting.</p><p>These two experts were feeling smug. They knew that they were fighting the weakest opponent, and they were pressuring him hard, but they had not been able to kill him yet. Still, Wei had suffered a few flesh wounds, and blood had started to drip from his body.</p><p>These two demons were so busy taunting Wei that neither of them noticed the swordlight that was approaching them as fast as sound. Suddenly and without warning, it sliced cleanly through their bodies.</p><p>Hui Yue had only taken a second to use his soulforce to see how everyone was doing and then a fraction of a second to send out a swordlight. He dared not waste more time on the others&apos; fights. He had to focus on his own fight, or it was likely this slippery Blood Demon would get away.</p><p>Although Hui Yue had absolute strength on his side, he was having a lot of issues pinning down his opponent.</p><p>His swordlight appeared from more than one angle, and he had built up an amazing momentum. He sent out more than a hundred swordlights, and they were made to cut off all avenues of this demon lord&#x2019;s escape.</p><p>This sword energy that swept out cut through one Blood Demon after another. While the strength of these swordlights slowly lost some of their power, they were still potent and lethal for all the weaker experts in the war.</p><p>The demon lord snorted as he felt how space around him became muddled. He felt his movements slow down, and how these swordlights were drawing closer and closer to him. All the hairs on his body stood on end, and he hissed as he bit down on his tongue trying to shock his body back into action.</p><p>Unfortunately, his body was not functioning because of the dao of time and space that had wrapped around him, not because of him being numbed. Sadly, he gained nothing except blood in his mouth and pain.</p><p>When Hui Yue saw this a sinister smile appeared on his lips, and he sent out even more swordlight; he knew everything was within his grasp now.</p><p>The demon lord understood that he had no chance of defeating Hui Yue as things were and with gritted teeth and blood streaming out from the corner of his lips, he reached into his storage treasure and took out four beads.</p><p>These beads were small and black. They were completely round, and when Hui Yue saw them, his eyes widened, and his hand which was holding the Celestial Sword started to sweat.</p><p>These beads were sinister. They were the World Ending beads. Their name was overbearing and their effect even more so.</p><p>When taken they would consume the fire of one&apos;s life, their lifeforce, and all their strength, blowing them up and causing serious destruction. The more years of their life they poured into these beads, the more destructive the explosion would become.</p><p>These beads did not care about friend and foe; they destroyed everything in sight. One would only use them during their final stand.</p><p>Hui Yue was unaware of how old this Blood Demon was. He was also unaware of how many years he had left to pour into the beads, but from fighting him, he could tell that he had not reached the time for his life to run out.</p><p>He was an immortal to begin with so as long as he did not injure himself, he could live for eternity. If he decided to commit suicide and pour all his energy into one of these beads, it would mean certain death even for someone as skilled as Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;Are you ready to face your doom?&quot; the Blood Demon asked with a bloody grin. His teeth were smeared with blood and his eyes filled with madness.</p><p>He had been a proud son of the heavens. He had been born superior to his family members, superior to many other Blood Demons even. He had grown up with everything he ever wanted within reach, but now he had been pushed around by a young punk who was not even a tenth his age!</p><p>This young man had an incredibly high understanding of the dao, he had a weapon that would make even those old powerhouses of the galaxy green with envy, and his strength of comprehension was simply outstanding to be able to superimpose his daos like he had.</p><p>This person had to die! If he were allowed to grow further, then he would become a serious threat to the Blood Demons. Even now he was a big threat, but he was within the scope of what the High Lord could manage. Even a manor lord would be able to deal with Hui Yue, but now that he could superimpose his daos, he was equal to the royal princes.</p><p>This was something that he had gained in a few hundred years! This war was likely to continue for a very long time and if he had already reached these achievements so soon who was to say he would not get even more lucky chances, even more time to gain comprehension of the daos, and end up becoming someone that even a manor lord could not contend with?</p><p>This could not be allowed so he pulled out the World Ending pill. Although he was proud, he would never hesitate to give up his life if it were for the sake of improving and saving the Blood Demons trouble later on.</p><p>When Hui Yue saw the maddening eyes of the Blood Demon, he instantly knew what he was planning, and he started to think as fast as he could.</p><p>He needed to not only protect himself but also protect Lan Feng, Ziqi, and Wei.</p><p>Hui Yue released his soulforce to the limits and flashed like lightning towards his three fighting friends.</p><p>Without wasting a moment, he pushed his speed to the limits and reached out his hand sucking Lan Feng, Pei Ziqi, and Wei into his Universe Box.</p><p>Seeing them disappear like that, the eyes of the demon lord were filled with hate and disbelief. &quot;How could you send them away?!&quot; he called out at a loss for what he had just witnessed.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
