Though even after it weakened it still bore down on Hui Yue to a frightening degree.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is not enough to suppress me!&quot; Hui Yue roared out as his soulforce exploded forth. At first, it was all a mist-like energy, but as it left his body, it turned solid into the shape of a chain which wrapped itself around Wei. This soulforce chain bound him making it impossible for him to move.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Hmph!&quot; Ancestral Worldpower exploded from the body of the guard, and the soulforce chain started cracking before it dissipated into the air.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was shocked when he saw how easily this chain of his was broken, and he instantly shook his head with a self-mocking smile. It was only natural that it could be broken if his opponent was strong enough, and as he faced someone at the peak of the Primordial Immortal rank, he realized how vast a difference in their strength there really was.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Hui Yue had no intention of giving up, and instead, he started opening himself up to the daos that he knew. He could feel the daos surround him and with a flick of his hand, balls of raging fire appeared above his palm. These fireballs shot toward the guard at an unprecedented speed. They traveled so fast that he was unable to avoid them and he was forced to create an Ancestral Worldpower barrier to block them.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment these balls of fire landed on the barrier an explosion sounded out as the ferocious energy contained within could no longer keep its shape. The resulting inferno covered the guard in a large, scorching curtain of fire.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This attack seemed frightfully strong, and he knew it was even capable of killing most experts, Hui Yue could feel everything which happened within the flames.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">So he knew that right now the guard was safe and sound. Not even the slightest burn was present on his body or face, and his expression was calm.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Considering that this was the case, Hui Yue waved his hand, and the pillar slowly subsided, all the fire returned to his hands and was absorbed by his body, once more turning into Ancestral Worldpower.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Not bad!&quot; the guard grinned as he looked at Hui Yue with admiration in his eyes, &quot;For a new God your control over fire is great and to think that you had fully comprehended the dao of Inferno in such a short time is also rather outstanding. But if you have nothing more than this, then you will lose!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Having said that the entire air within the chamber turned serious. This was no life and death battle, but it was a great opportunity for Hui Yue to see just how strong he was.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are just getting started!&quot; he answered with loud laughter, and a devouring force erupted from his body. This devouring force started sucking in every single bit of energy from the world around them, but slowly it also started to forcefully withdraw the Ancestral Worldpower from within the guard&apos;s body and deliver it to Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was incapable of actually sucking out one&apos;s lifeforce and blood, but he was already able to do so with their Ancestral Worldpower, albeit at a rather slow pace.</p><p dir="ltr">For Wei, the amount of Ancestral Worldpower he was losing could be considered nothing, yet for Hui Yue, it was an overwhelming amount of energy which filled his body to the brim, and it almost made him glow in the dimly lit room.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Devour?!&quot; Wei cried out in shock, &quot;not only have you comprehended the dao of Inferno, but you also have comprehended the dao of devouring? I guess you do have some skill as most Primordial Immortals are nowhere near as strong as you, but still, even if you devour some of my Ancestral Worldpower you are incapable of devouring it all. If you did, you would, without a doubt, destroy your body. So what will you do now?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This whole time Wei had been taking it very easy during the fight. He never did anything but defending himself, and he felt no need to actually engage in combat yet. Yes, Hui Yue had shown some amazing abilities, but they were nothing compared to the strength of an expert at the peak of the Primordial Immortal rank.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t be too cocky,&quot; Hui Yue laughed as suddenly two crescent moons created from Ancestral Worldpower came chopping down on Wei&apos;s head.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Hiyaa!&quot; Hui Yue yelled out as he poured as much Ancestral Worldpower into the crescent moonblades that he could in such a short time.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the blades cut down, they gleamed ferociously in the dimly lit room. Their speed was as fast as lightning, and their razor-sharp edge came crashing down upon the guard.</p><p dir="ltr">Wei looked stunned for a brief moment before he finally lifted his arms and another barrier appeared above him. This barrier was not as strong as the last one, and the moment the crescent moonblades landed on it, thousands of small cracks appeared. Cracks which ran the length of the barrier until moments after it shattered.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">One of the moonblades had completely broken apart while the other was still falling after impacting the barrier.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Ancestral Worldpower erupted from the body of the guard, but he could only dodge as the moonblade was quickly approaching his head. Hui Yue used the rest of its power but only managed to leave a cut on the guard&#x2019;s cheek.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A single drop of blood slid down his cheek, and Wei stood there stunned for a moment before he turned to Hui Yue with wild joy in his eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What was that?!&quot; he exclaimed excitedly. &quot;It was clearly not a dao but an attack of some kind. It was magnificent! Able to shatter my barrier and even cut my cheek in a single strike. Believe me, that should definitely not be possible with your strength!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Since this was not a life and death battle, Hui Yue did not mind taking a short break to explain, so he just smiled. &quot;It was an Ancestral Worldpower Skill that the family guards with ferocity,&quot; he smiled. &quot;It&apos;s called Double Moon, and it is not that hard to learn.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see,&quot; a hint of longing could be seen in the eyes of the guard. &quot;I know about Ancestral Worldpower Skills, but the ones who own them are not likely to sell or allow outsiders to learn them. Obviously, a mere guard is not allowed to learn the ones we have here in Diyu. But the strength of an Ancestral Worldpower Skill is truly magnificent!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t worry; we&#x2019;re just getting started!&quot; Hui Yue promised with a grin, and Wei returned the grin while shaking his head, &quot;in that case I guess it&#x2019;s time that I start to attack!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Hui Yue could not help but shake slightly. He understood that it was one thing to attack someone who was standing still, but that was quite different than a real fight.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Just as he thought this, he felt a sudden rush of Ancestral Worldpower coming his way at a speed faster than what the eye could see.</p><p dir="ltr">Relying fully on his instincts, Hui Yue avoided and moments after a boom sounded out as an attack exploded right next to him. &quot;The dao of sneak attacks?&quot; Hui Yue asked confused, unsure of what exactly had happened but his question just made Wei laugh out loud, &quot;sneak attacks you say? I guess you could call it that, but it is more like a dao of soundwaves. You cannot see it; it moves faster than you can imagine and it can blow up anything in its path.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Be careful that you don&apos;t end up getting blown to bits!&quot; Wei grinned, and Hui Yue just laughed in return as he reached out to the red gem within his core.</p><p dir="ltr">The red gem lit up, and Hui Yue felt his entire being suddenly becoming as tough and strong as a mountain.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was curious about how strong this defense was, and without worrying too much, he met the next sound wave head on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the sound wave landed on Hui Yue, he felt like a kite that had it&apos;s string cut and was instantly shot backwards like a meteor. He slammed hard against the wall of the room before he slipped down to the ground once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Wei&apos;s face was filled with worry when he saw this, but his worry quickly turned to shock as he saw Hui Yue&apos;s face filled with a grin and that there were no wounds whatsoever on his body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What are you? A monster?&quot; Wei asked shocked as he came closer and observed Hui Yue from every angle and not a scratch could be seen.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I must be quite sturdy!&quot; Hui Yue laughed out loud as he reached out his hand and clenched his fist. Suddenly the gravity within the chamber changed and Wei, who was completely not expecting this, was suddenly forced to the ground.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;And to think for a moment I was worried about a little monster like you,&quot; Wei sighed with a hint of amusement in the voice as Ancestral Worldpower once more erupted from his body. He pushed his body up against the heavy gravitational pull.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Keep this gravitational field up at all times!&quot; Wei said as he slowly staggered backward, &quot;it is quite powerful! And it will cause trouble for even peak Primordial Immortals because they will need to constantly guard themselves with Ancestral Worldpower to be able to move.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, what would you do if I changed it?&quot; Hui Yue asked with a toothy grin as he suddenly changed the pulling force from seeming as if the world were resting on one&#x2019;s shoulders to being as light as a feather and back again. Hui Yue started to fluctuate the gravitational pull in the room.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is one troublesome dao!&quot; Wei said through gritted teeth.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not suddenly attack Wei. Although he could, he would rather fight him when he had gotten slightly used to the constantly changing gravity as the reason they were fighting was so he could improve his fighting skills and learn how to use his true strength. So far it seemed that his dao of gravity was truly quite helpful, but even so, it was useless if he was not capable of wounding the person he was up against.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Get used to the changes in gravity, and we&apos;ll continue sparring,&quot; Hui Yue grinned. &quot;I need to know just how weak I am, but I also need to know if I can win if I use all the secrets I have at my disposal.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue pondered for some time about what to do next. He had decided that he was not going to ask the black figure for help, but he still had plenty of aces up his sleeve and right now what he was lacking was combat experience.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I guess it&#x2019;s time to try something else,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself as he reached out for the red mist. Seconds later his body started transforming into the red wolf.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Hui Yue changing, Wei&apos;s face was filled with shock and surprise. &quot;You are a descendant of the great roc! How can you suddenly turn into a wolf?!&quot; he exclaimed shocked, but Hui Yue just grinned at him, &quot;I have more than one bloodline in my body.&quot; He answered vaguely before jumping at Wei. His newfound strength was so overwhelming that he did not even feel the pressure emitted by Wei.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was now time for the real fight to begin; the fight where both sides would do their very best to win.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
