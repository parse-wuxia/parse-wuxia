The experts that had followed them from the city would originally have said something, yet when they saw demons amongst the Sun family members, they lost any pity they felt for them.</p><p>To have taken the same side as the enemies of humanity was the same as having forsaken every human that was fighting to keep balance in the galaxy.</p><p>While Hui Yue was massacring, there was only one thought on his mind, and that was to kill everyone before they could kill the hostages and blame it all on Hui Yue.</p><p>It took him less than an hour to wipe out the entire family, and when he finished he started searching the perimeter for signs of the three hostages, but no matter where he looked there were absolutely no signs of them.</p><p>&quot;Have you found them?&quot; Hui Yue asked urgently as they all gathered at the main square in what used to be the Sun family&apos;s home.</p><p>Unfortunately, everyone shook their heads. No one looked happy, and they all thought the worst possible situation could have happened.</p><p>They could have been shipped out of the world already, on their way to the Blood Demons&#x2019; headquarters for the sake of being used as a bargaining chip against Hui Yue later on, or they could have been killed before even reaching the Sun family&apos;s home.</p><p>Just as the negative thoughts were consuming them all, Hui Yue felt his communication orb stir. He picked it up, heaved a heavy breath of relief, and sighed deeply.</p><p>On the other side of the communication orb was Sha Yun. &quot;We are all fine,&quot; she said, but her voice was shaking slightly. &quot;We were caught and brought out of the city by the Hu family, but it was Blood Demons who attacked us. Fortunately, we were able to hold our own against the Hu family, and they had no one strong enough to deal with us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When we came to, we had already been rescued. Everything happened very fast; I am not sure exactly what happened. The Blood Demons and Hu family are all dead now; we left none alive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Some people had followed the group from the city, and when they arrived had found out that the Hu family had betrayed humanity and captured humans on the orders of Blood Demons, everyone joined the frenzied battle. Because of their help we were able to complete massacre the family and the Blood Demons very quickly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We are getting ready to return to the Ling family now,&quot; Sha Yun finished saying, and Hui Yue nodded his head. &quot;We have finished here as well,&quot; he said with a voice that was choked with emotions.</p><p>The connection in the communication orb shut off, and when Hui Yue lifted his head, he saw relief in the many faces around them.</p><p>Even the ones who did not know Hui Yue very well felt relieved. After seeing him seething with anger, and what he was capable of doing, they feared that if something had truly happened to this wife of his and his friends, then his anger would reach unprecedented levels. If such a thing occurred, who knew what or who he would take his anger out on?</p><p>&quot;Well then, you heard the woman,&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile filled with relief. &quot;Let&#x2019;s return to the Ling family now.&quot;</p><p>Everyone gave a curt nod of their heads, not daring to speak. They all feared that their words would do something to sour the young man&apos;s mood again.</p><p>&quot;Well that was quite thrilling,&quot; Cai Jie said with a sigh. &quot;Getting kidnapped and rescued so fast must be quite rare, our Yue sure is quite ruthless when it comes to it.&quot;</p><p>Cai Jie was not criticizing Hui Yue but praising him. He was smiling brightly and elated that they were all safe so much so that he could not hold back from joking around with Hue Yue.</p><p>While Hui Yue just gave a wry smile, everyone else started to feel worried. They had not been able to tell whether this was his criticism or just general banter, and they feared that Hui Yue would explode in anger.</p><p>The battle had ended, and they set out from the Hu and Sun families to enter the Ling family once more. It was important for them to start discussing what to do now that their original plan had turned out to be useless. The demons were far ahead of them. They knew their plans and knew where they were. They had even kidnapped some of them! If they were capable enough of doing so once, then they could do it again.</p><p>Hui Yue knew that It would not be easy to rescue his friends if they were indeed captured again. The Blood Demons would surely learn from their mistake of underestimating Hui Yue&apos;s abilities.</p><p>Fortunately, Hui Yue had eradicated the entire Blood Demon group and the two families completely, so it would take a bit of time before the Blood Demons got to know that Hui Yue had allied himself with the Ling family. But in the end, although it would take time, it would not be too long till they knew.</p><p>Rumors about the demise of the Hu and Sun family would start to spread very fast throughout the western region. As it did, the tales would speak of the Ling family and their friends, but the most emphasis would be placed on the Ling family who slayed the many Blood Demons and their companions. This was because everyone knew who the native Ling family was and who they were in the western region.</p><p>Rumors were already starting to spread now that they had gone out to battle, and it was likely that it would reach the ears of the Blood Demon&#x2019;s main offices within days.</p><p>&quot;There ought to be more families who have succumbed to either temptation or threats by the Blood Demons,&quot; Hui Yue spoke with Ling Fang on the way back.</p><p>&quot;I want you to do all in your power to find out which families in the entire western region are in cahoots with the Blood Demons. Also if you can find locations where the Blood Demons have their strongholds then let us know.&quot;</p><p>Had this been before they had visited the Hu family, then Ling Fang would not have told Hui Yue everything. He would have feared that the young man would endanger himself and that there was no reason for him to follow this young man&#x2019;s orders completely.</p><p>Now things were different. He had understood that Hui Yue had the power to back up his arrogant way of looking down on the other Blood Demons and factions in the western region.</p><p>He also understood that Hui Yue was going to do everyone a favor by weeding out the bad seeds and killing off the Blood Demons that had troubled the humans here for the last year.</p><p>&quot;I know where their main refuge is in this world,&quot; Ling Fang said seriously as he looked at Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;When the Blood Demons ordered a retreat, they did so very orderly, and they all rushed back to a specific city. This city was lost some months ago during the constant fights against demonkind. No humans are alive within the city, but they did not leave it as they have done with the others. Instead, they settled in, burnt all the corpses, and took over the city as their new home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since then they have launched attacks on various cities in this world. Some cities were pillaged, burned, and forced to retreat while others have successfully fought them off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They should have attacked our city first,&quot; Ling Fang said with disdain. &quot;Whoever is their strategist is not very smart. It might sound all good to sacrifice their cultivators in fights for the smaller cities, and take over the world before they start attacking us, but when they reach us, there would be so many fewer demons than there was at the start.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They will need a large force to deal with us, but their group has constantly been losing members because of these constant skirmishes so when they finally reached us they did not have enough demons left to defeat us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not to mention they still haven&#x2019;t even taken over the entire world. Most of the immortals have fled to the main city to help bolster our strength during their final attack.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I imagine that now that they have lost, they are going to ask for reinforcement. It&#x2019;s just a matter of time before we will fight again, and this time the battle will be much bigger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; Hui Yue looked into the distance and smiled. &quot;We will wipe out the city where they have taken up residence. If we can&apos;t even handle these Blood Demons, then our entire mission would just be a huge joke.&quot;</p><p>Ling Fang was shocked. He had not heard about Hui Yue&apos;s plans, but he understood that this young man had a vendetta when it came to the Blood Demons.</p><p>They returned to the city and with them were the cultivators that had no relationship with the Ling family. As soon as they entered the city, they were littered with questions, and every single one of them basked in glory enjoying the sudden attention they were getting.</p><p>Each one of them went to a tavern where they could trade this juicy information for a free meal, and since they all had the same thought, they chose different taverns all over the city.</p><p>They were all mercenaries and thus it mattered to them to get stuff for free. Though there were a few, who hurried back to meet up with their brothers instead and tell them about what they had seen.</p><p>Suddenly whispers erupted all over the city. Everyone seemed to know about the execution of the Hu and Sun families, and as Hui Yue had predicted, the ones who got all the fame were the Ling family.</p><p>Suddenly, many young men stood outside the family&apos;s gate begging to be taken in as a member with another surname; some even begged to be common guards.</p><p>Everyone felt that the Ling family was fighting for humanity, for freedom, and for the city which had their spirits broken because of the constant and devastating demon&apos;s attacks.</p><p>Mercenaries from all over the western region were present in the city. It was after all the capital of the Gate of Retribution, something which called for all mercenaries and although there were small branches all over the entire Western Region, none were bigger than the one here.</p><p>There was a constant stream of people exiting and entering the city and the world. They could hear people talking and were all suddenly aware of the execution of two families. Although these two families held no actual power outside of this world, they were still an example of what would happen to those that helped the Blood Demons in their quest for conquest. Everyone loved how the Ling family stood up and fought for humanity. They fought for their rights to be free and not be under the command of the Blood Demons.</p><p>The rumor spread so fast that soon the entire western region started hearing about it, and although Hui Yue had expected it to be fast, he never would have guessed that it would spread faster than fire among dry wood.</p><p>By the time they arrived at the Ling family&apos;s mansion&apos;s gates, the rumors had already started spreading like rings in water within the city. By the time they had gathered in the library once more, the rumors had already made it out of the city and into the vast galaxy.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
