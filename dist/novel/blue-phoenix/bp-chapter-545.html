In spite of this, he had never expected that the punishment would be all that severe. Such a powerful sect like the Celestial Sword Sect should be happy to have new, fresh blood in their ranks, but looking at these elders, he understood that he might have made a mistake in his calculations. Having relations outside of the sect was enough to cause even these head elders to feel a headache coming their way.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The punishment couldn&apos;t possibly be the death sentence...&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself shocked. To keep full control over the sect, they always got rid of anyone who was born outside of their control.</p><p dir="ltr">But although they usually got rid of these experts, it might be different now that Hui Yue had shown up. This level of talent was simply unheard of; his performance so far was enough to shock them speechless. Because of this youngster&#x2019;s potential killing him made them all feel that it would be such a shame for their family.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;His wings shine so brilliantly,&quot; one of the male elders suddenly said, his voice bringing all the other elders to focus on Hui Yue again. Right now his wings were gone, and so was his wolf form. Hui Yue was standing casually in front of them. He was waiting to hear what they would say, yet one of his hands were clenched and the other held Huli.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Should these elders act in a threatening manner, then Hui Yue would instantly activate the Universe Box and drag himself and Huli into safety. He was not willing to risk Huli&apos;s and his own life for being acknowledged by this sect.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The wings were as clear as someone of the third generation,&quot; the elder who had spoken before said once more. &quot;The wings are as brilliant as ours or even more brilliant, however, this young man is not even a century old yet.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let us think about this. His father or mother has to be a second generation member. The second generation! That is the direct children of the great roc. The great roc only had twelve children, and the majority of them have already died. Now only three remain. Our patriarch is one of them, and the two others are ancestors of our sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Only the two oldest of our head elders are from the third generation, the rest of us are fourth generation descendants.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Could his parent be one of the experts that we thought to have died, or are they the ancestors or the patriarch?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;None of us can say for sure, but we need to contact the patriarch and tell him exactly what is going on. We will suggest a milder punishment for this new genius as he can bring our sect to new heights!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yes, let&#x2019;s contact the patriarch immediately!&quot; Elder Pei Ziqi said excitedly and picked up a glass orb similar to the one that he saw the Fu brother&apos;s use.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">A small mist appeared within the orb and moments after the face of a middle-aged man appeared. His face was frowning, and his eyes were sharp as swords. A small beard framed his mouth, and although it was black, gray hairs could be seen in between the black hairs.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Why are you contacting me? Has something happened with the trials?&quot; He asked with a mildly irritated voice, but Elder Pei Ziqi, who was holding the orb, shook her head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Patriarch we needed to contact you because of a major issue that has come to light,&quot; Ziqi said politely; her voice trembled slightly as she bowed to the glass orb.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We came across a direct descendant of the Great Roc, but someone who is the result of an expert breaking the rules of our sect.&quot; Ziqi continued her explanation, and every time she spoke the frown on the patriarch&apos;s face turned more and more frustrated.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You know the rules; they are simple. Someone like that needs to be executed and so does his parents, why have you bothered contacting me about such a trivial matter?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Patriarch, sir, this is different... He is an expert of the third generation. His parents are without a doubt of the second generation considering the intensity of his wings.&quot; Ziqi hurriedly said, and although the face of the patriarch turned stunned and was full of disbelief Ziqi continued to speak quickly, &quot;He was born from a mortal and was a mortal himself. He was able to become a God before turning a century old. He has dual bloodlines in his body, both the bloodline of the great roc but also the bloodline of some red wolf.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;On top of this, he has grasped the dao of space and soulforce. For a child under a hundred years of age, his talents are simply too outstanding; we, head elders, greatly suggest that you, patriarch, make an exception!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You said that he is of the third generation, yet he is not even over a hundred years old yet?&quot; The patriarch asked with a slightly shaking voice, and Ziqi instantly nodded her head and said loudly, &quot;Yes, sir, &#xA0;he is indeed below a hundred years of age, and he went from being a mortal cultivator to becoming a God in less than a century. His wings shine so intensely that he can only be a third generation descendant.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let me see!&quot; The patriarch instantly ordered, and Ziqi turned the glass ball so that the patriarch could look at Hui Yue rather than the group of elders.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Boy, let me see your wings,&quot; the patriarch ordered, and Hui Yue, who understood just how important this was, instantly followed the order. He reached out to the wings in his core and wings appeared on his back shining just as brilliantly as before. He flapped them slightly and stretched them out for the patriarch to see.</p><p dir="ltr">The eyes of the patriarch were filled with shock as he looked at these wings. It was clear that they were exactly like the ones that the third generation descendants had. This was something which could not be faked, and the fact that Hui Yue had been able to receive such a strong bloodline, even though he had been a mortal at birth, meant that his parents were definitely from the second generation.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Tell me about your parents,&quot; the patriarch said breathlessly as he looked at Hui Yue with a fevered gaze. Feeling a little awkward Hui Yue scratched the back of his head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;My parents were normal mortals. Currently, they are both at the King rank after I had them consume Silvermoon&apos;s Pill.&quot; Hui Yue said honestly, but his words just made the patriarch frown.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your parents are they your real parents? Do you look like them? Which one of them is the red wolf for you to have two such bloodlines?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Both my parents are humans.&quot; Hui Yue answered with a strange expression on his face, &quot;And I don&apos;t look like any of them either.&quot; He continued to answer the questions honestly.</p><p dir="ltr">Although he was honest, he was also rather cunning. Hui Yue understood that every word he said made it seem as if his parents were not his real parents and thus they would not face much danger.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Were there ever any mysterious people around you who assisted you? Someone who has wings like yourself or the wolf figure like yourself?&quot; The patriarch continued to ask, but Hui Yue just shook his head, and it seemed as if he really was sad that he could not answer the question well.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;No one is to touch a hair on my nephew&apos;s head,&quot; the patriarch finally sighed as he looked at Hui Yue after realizing that there was no way to figure out where his long lost brother or sister had gone.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although he was born outside of the sect he is a third generation descendant! We cannot kill one with such a pure bloodline, and his other talents are quite outstanding as well. However, let it be known that although he is a third generation disciple, and a member of the younger generation, it is not possible for him to ever become a head elder. And he can never become the sect leader either, that is his punishment for being born outside of the sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;However, now that he is here let the rest of the family know that this young man is my nephew and that he has been approved as one of the geniuses of the younger generation of the Celestial Sword Sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pondering for a moment the patriarch stroked his beard before he finally looked at Hui Yue again, &quot;I assume you came to Youdu because you want to participate in the trials to become a Judge of Hell? Although you are a genius, you are probably not strong enough to be chosen, but even so, I think you could benefit from participating.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yes, you should participate, and when the trials are done, join us and return to the Celestial Sword Sect. I can see you have a contracted beast companion. Don&#x2019;t worry you can keep her by your side even within the inner court of our sect,&quot; the patriarch said with a decisive voice.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;For now let the head elders take care of you. Settle down with the Celestial Sword Sect there in Youdu before it is time for the trials to start. Also, try and make some friends.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Ze!&quot; The patriarch called out, and the young man who had been standing completely silent to the side instantly stepped forward. He fell to one knee as he bowed to the patriarch.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This time you have done a great merit by bringing my nephew back with you. I will gift you a thousand profound pearls to help you raise your strength.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The already bowing Pei Ze clasped his hands together and lowered his body as he bowed deeply to the patriarch. An elated smile currently filled his face. From this, one could see that a thousand profound pearls were really no ordinary treasure.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Young nephew Hui Yue, from now on you will be called Pei Yue by the members of our Celestial Sword Sect. What you call yourself when you are outside the sect has no interest for me, but inside the sect, you are a descendant of the Pei family, and thus, it has to be your last name.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;As a gift, I will give you five hundred profound pearls as well, use them well!&quot; The patriarch said before the glass orb turned back to how it was before. It was clear that the matter was finished now.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze was incomparable excited. The reward he had been promised would be of great benefit for him, and although he already knew that Hui Yue had no interest in being the next sect leader now that he had been forbidden to walk down this road, Pei Ze wanted his support even more. To think that a third generation expert was found amongst the younger generation was simply unfathomable. It had been at least fifty thousand years since the last third generation descendant was born. The three old men, the two ancestors, and the patriarch had not had any wives for a very very long time. All of their wives had died long ago, and none had taken a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Ze, bring Pei Yue and his beast companion around the grounds. Introduce them to the other direct descendants and ensure that everyone is aware of Pei Yue&apos;s status within the sect. For now, keep it a secret that he is not allowed to join the power struggles for the sect leader seat.&quot; Elder Pei Qin said smilingly as he gave the order to Pei Ze. Pei Ze quickly nodded his head and reached out his arm showing Hui Yue towards the door in a respectful manner. Although Hui Yue was younger than him, he was a third generation expert and such an expert required great respect. His bloodline was astonishingly pure, and his future achievements in the Celestial Sword Sect would not be small. In the future, Hui Yue would truly be a dragon amongst men!</p><br></div><p></p>
