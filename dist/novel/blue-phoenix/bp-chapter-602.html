He said nothing, just waited for the clerk to find the formations for him.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearing his throat, the clerk looked at Hui Yue curiously. &quot;I need you to show me your ten seals before I can allow you to purchase any formations. One cannot purchase formations for others, they have to be for yourself,&quot; he continued, and Hui Yue nodded his head. He lifted his hand, and ten seals sprung to life and started floating around his hand.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Is this enough?&quot; he asked with a smile on his face, and the clerk instantly shut up and nodded his head. &quot;I will find a set of formations for beginners. Will you be paying with Worldpower Stones or contribution points?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who had still not taken any missions, had no contribution points and thus he had no other option than to pay with Ancestral Worldpower Stones.</p><p dir="ltr">The price in Ancestral Worldpower Stones was high compared to using contribution points, but he had no other option.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That will be five thousand Worldpower Stones. This is a bundle of formations for beginners. It contains the Blazing Tiger formation, which is a simple attacking formation, it also contains the Spacelock formation, the Iron Shield formation, the Groundbreaker formation and finally the Screech of the Roc formation.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You can use the Blazing Tiger and the Screech of the Roc to attack with. The Blazing Tiger is a formation which summons a tiger created from flames while the Screech of the Roc uses sound waves to damage one&#x2019;s opponent.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The Spacelock formation is a simple formation which can slow the opponent for a short while, but it is nothing like the real Spacelock technique used by an expert that has comprehended the dao of space.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The Iron Shield Formation creates a shield in front of you, and although it is capable of blocking new Gods and some Primordial immortals, it is not strong enough to block Immortals of Creations or attacks that rely on more than one dao.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Finally, we have the Groundbreaker formation.&quot; He continued, explaining the five formations to Hui Yue. &quot;The Groundbreaker formation is different from the others. It is a formation you place on the ground surrounding an area. When the formation is activated, it will break the ground and shatter the entire area that it contains, making it a bottomless pit. It is also impossible to fly within this formation if you are not strong enough.&quot; &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We have a few other sets of formations for beginners, but mainly the formations we store are for Intermediate, Master, and the Grandmaster ranks.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Our Formation Palace mainly focuses on the formations we lay down around the sect, and on merged formations that need more than one person to create. When you become a Formation Master, you will be asked to help lay down the Thousand World Protection formation on our sect, something which will strengthen the current Thousand World Protection formation we have erected around the sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I assume that you just recently came to understand formations, and thus I do not expect you to become a master before at least a century has passed, if not a millennium.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your current cultivation speed is quite fast, or so I&#x2019;ve heard, so it might be possible for you to advance quickly, but remember that some things cannot be rushed. Formations are like this, now go and practice them,&quot; the clerk said with a sigh. Hearing this, Hui Yue started to understand that although this person was a mere clerk, he seemed to have quite a bit of knowledge about formations. Could he perhaps also be a master of some kind?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not ask, but he showed great respect when he accepted the formations and handed over a bag of Worldpower Stones.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thank you. I will return when I have them perfected,&quot; he said politely then bowed before leaving.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The whole time he had been within the palace, no one else had come inside, and it was just them. After he had left, the clerk looked at him with curiosity. &quot;To create ten seals in three days is quite the feat. I see why the elders were so keen on keeping him in the sect. He is definitely not someone we can afford to become enemies with.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing deeply, he found a chair and sat down. He closed his eyes and started to sense the dao around him in the hope of gaining some insights into its vast mysteries. People never really visited the Formation Palace often, so it was natural for him to do whatever he wanted.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and a golden flash appeared in them before thousands upon thousands of seals in the form of small flowers appeared around him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;To think that he managed to from ten seals in three days. I might have to fight old man Tian for that kid...&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had already left the palace and was unaware of what had happened, but if he had seen it, then his heart would be shaking in shock, and he would have taken an extra look at the young clerk.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">What he did not know was that to be a member of the Formation Palace, even a simple clerk, one had to be a Formation Master.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This branch of the sect had very few members, and the only man who had time to stay there all day long was the elder in charge of all the Formation Masters within the Formation Palace.</p><p dir="ltr">He might have looked like a young clerk, but the truth was that he was one of the strongest, and most respected, elders within the entire sect. He had been an elder for a longer time than Pei Ziqi, but he had refused to let go of his elder position because he was still waiting for a legacy apprentice.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Unaware of all this, Hui Yue walked towards the part of the sect which was for training. He did not enter the fields or the dummy training area, instead, he entered the house which had many meditation rooms. This was the best place to train in silence.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everywhere that Hui Yue walked, he was met with curious gazes, but Hui Yue completely ignored them. He pretended that he could not sense everyone who looked at him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their gazes were filled with the same emotions as before, but now a few of them blazed with fighting intent. Hui Yue could tell that those who wished to fight him were all incredibly strong. They were not members of the younger generation; therefore, they all held back. Challenging a younger generation member was not acceptable.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;You are like a lovely stew right in front of a hungering man, but they can&apos;t touch you. You should see just how funny their expressions are when they realize that they can&apos;t do anything about their fighting spirit. Who asked them to trouble you in the first place!&apos; Lan Feng&apos;s voice was filled with laughter as it rung out in Hui Yue&apos;s mind.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue said nothing in return nor was there any change in his expressions, but Lan Feng knew Hui Yue well enough to know that he was quite entertained by these people who riled themselves up.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment he entered the building he found a group of experts that were chatting with one another in the corner and that there were ten desks with clerks waiting to sign people in for the rooms.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue completely ignored the experts and headed for the desk furthest away from them where he saw a young member of the sect that he had seen before, a member of the younger generation. This person&#x2019;s eyes widened with surprise when he saw Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; He asked tentatively. He knew that Hui Yue was the strongest in the younger generation, but at the same time, he had a hard time showing respect for this youth who came out of nowhere. Not only that, but he had also taken over the position of leader of the younger generation from the young master he followed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I would like to borrow a meditation room for a few days.&quot; Hui Yue said casually, and the clerk nodded his head. &quot;Will you pay in contribution points or Worldpower Stones?&quot; he asked, and Hui Yue once again had no other option than to use Worldpower Stones.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;That will be three hundred Worldpower Stones a day; how many days do you need?&quot; The clerk continued to ask doing his job normally as he tried to ignore the fact that the person in front of him was Hui Yue. Even though the clerk could ignore Hui Yue, others within the room had already noticed him long ago. Hui Yue could hear them talking about him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He must be super rich to pay with Worldpower Stones. We get a mere hundred stones a month, and he is paying with stones instead of contribution points. Do you think he got them from his father?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I think that perhaps he might have gotten them from a lucky encounter. This is why I want to be outside in the real world and see what it&#x2019;s like!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He is quite attractive. I thought he would look like a monkey or something.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Ignoring everyone, Hui Yue just looked at the clerk and took out a bag of Ancestral Worldpower Stones and handed two thousand one hundred stones over. &quot;Seven days.&quot; He said casually, and the clerk, who had never before seen so many Worldpower Stones, dumbfoundedly accepted them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The reason that everything was much more expensive when using Worldpower Stones than contribution points was because Worldpower Stones were needed to keep the sect alive. Although the sect earned money from taxing the world and from smaller sects and worlds under their protection, a sect of this size simply needed an enormous amount of money.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Every member was given a hundred Worldpower Stones a month which was millions of Worldpower Stones in total. And although Hui Yue could be considered rich, he was not going to be able to keep paying in Worldpower Stones for long.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh well, I&apos;ll worry about it later,&quot; he mumbled to himself, and the clerk looked at him strangely as he did not catch exactly what Hui Yue said.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Excuse me; I was just speaking to myself. Let&#x2019;s go to the room,&quot; he said with a smile on his face. The clerk just shrugged his shoulders before leading Hui Yue to the back of the room where they went up a set of stairs.</p><p dir="ltr">The second floor was filled with rooms. They walked down a small hallway, and Hui Yue was given the third room on the right where he entered and sat down.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment he sat down, the door closed behind him. He waved his hand, and the bundle of formations appeared above them.</p><p dir="ltr">It was five small booklets again, and these booklets explained how to order his seals, where to inject his soulforce, and how to let it flow through his seals. If it were done the right way, it would draw out various daos in the world around him and use their characteristics when executing the formation.</p><p dir="ltr">The Blazing Tiger would draw on the dao of flame and take the shape of a tiger which would then attack. The Spacelock formation would draw on the dao of space and so on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was not before now that Hui Yue understood this and he nodded his head; it made sense that the formations would draw on the universal daos.</p><p dir="ltr">This was also why Formation Masters were so dreadful. They were capable of using daos that they had not yet comprehended!&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
