An Immortal of Creation was not as simple as a Primordial Immortal. They had power far greater than a Primordial Immortal, but even still he had lost to An He.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was shocking news, but Hui Yue acted like it wasn&apos;t important in the least.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Brother Jie told me that he was an Immortal of Creation back when he was still a God. It was at that time that he and his martial brother were ambushed by An He and his Generals. Because it was a surprise attack, they were caught off guard. Cai Jie managed to survive after being severely injured, but that was because his older martial brother used his life to let him escape their formation.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;After witnessing his martial brother sacrificing himself, brother Jie was filled with rage and boundless hate, but he had no other option than to flee. He could not afford to throw away the life that his brother had given him. He was lucky that An He and his Generals did not give chase since he was already seriously wounded. This is the reason Jie is so obsessed with killing An He.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;While fleeing, brother Jie entered the closest world which happened to be the Divine Beast World. As his body made from Ancestral Worldpower was slowly dissipating, he used the rest of his energy to create a body from clay which he could use to recover his strength.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Cai Jie, although currently in the body of a mortal, already has the soul of a God. He has been a God before, and when he forms a body from Ancestral Worldpower it will not be created based on his current body, but similar to the one he had before. At the time he again reaches the God rank, he will also once again become an Immortal of Creation.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone nodded their heads. It was quite astonishing that Cai Jie was such a high ranked expert, but now their biggest fear was the fact that despite being so powerful, even he had suffered defeat at the hands of An He. Was it not the same as saying that they too would be helpless in front of An He?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although they were worried, Hui Yue did not seem worried as he leaned back in the chair.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I don&apos;t have a lot of energy right now.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I just used the Nirvana Phoenix Flame and need to recover my energy. When it is back, we will instantly refine the next person and continue until everyone has had their bodies refined.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I need to create a few Silvermoon&apos;s Pills for my family as well.&quot; Hui Yue continued. &quot;You guys go rest and cultivate, and I will create these pills to extend the life expectancy of my family.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Agreeing with Hui Yue, they quickly returned to their own rooms leaving behind only Hui Yue, his parents, and younger brother.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Lei had been entirely focused on his body since Hui Yue introduced a wisp of the Nirvana Phoenix Flame into his body, so he had not heard anything of what was said in the room. However, his parents were different. They had heard every single word, and although they had not understood all of it, and did not know who this &apos;brother Jie&apos; was, they understood that the world that Hui Yue now belonged to was very different from the world they lived in.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Son, you make us so proud.&quot; Hui Guang said merrily. Together he and Hui Lifen stood up while their faces were beaming with happiness. &quot;We are going to return and prepare for the banquet tomorrow. If you need anything come find us.&quot; He said as he placed a hand on his son&apos;s shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Lifen was just about to awaken the younger man when Hui Yue stopped her and shook his head with a tender expression in his eyes. &quot;It&#x2019;s best not to bother him right now.&quot; He said. &quot;He needs to study all the benefits he has gained from the refinement of his body.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Within the next few days, I will also refine your bodies. Although it won&apos;t be as earth-shattering a change as it will be for little Lei, it will nonetheless bring you great benefits as well.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am going to make these pills which will make you all into King ranked experts.&quot; Hui Yue continued. &quot;They will extend your lifespan, and you will be able to go exploring the world as you wish.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Since you are not cultivators, you will have to start cultivating when you reach the King rank, but although it is a high rank in our world, in other worlds it is but the starting point. For you two, it will also be a starting point.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although I want you to start cultivating a little, I don&apos;t expect you to become experts.&quot; He continued and as he spoke his parents were at first shocked, then worried, and after a second slightly relieved. &quot;The best time for an expert to train is when they are young, and although I love the two of you, you are a bit too old to start cultivating. If you put your best effort in, you might be able to become Emperor ranked experts.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I wish I could allow for you to become Gods, but to do so, I would need you to be Saints first. Still, I have different ways of prolonging your lives, and although you will never be able to leave this world, I can promise you a long life where you can see our family grow.&quot; Hui Yue said.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, both Hui Lifen and Hui Guang were overwhelmed. Listening to what Hui Yue said, their eyes were overflowing with tears. They knew that their son truly loved them, and they too feared that they would die early without the chance to see their children grow up.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We will let you rest now.&quot; Hui Lifen said. Neither she nor her husband commented on the words that Hui Yue had said but within their eyes was gratitude and excitement.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They were mortals, and they had lived harsh lives. Their lifespan was limited, and they had often dreamed about being cultivators, being people who could live for hundreds of years. Those people who could travel the world and experience many things. They had dreamed about being able to see their grandchildren grow up and their families flourish. All of these were dreams they had but never dared voice them, yet now their son had said that their wish would become reality.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue saw his parents to the door and turned to look at his younger brother who was deeply focused. He felt so good after seeing his family living happily like this, and he could not help but feel elated to be home.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue sat down on the ground not far away from Hui Lei and closed his eyes as he entered meditation. He too needed to restore his energy as he had used it all earlier when he was refining his brother&apos;s body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The day quickly came to an end, and Hui Yue had restored all of his energy. After becoming a God, it was a lot quicker for him to restore the energy that he had used, and therefore, he was done after a few hours.</p><p dir="ltr">As Hui Yue finished, he did not instantly start to cultivate or train, instead, he sat down on the chair once more and closed his eyes. He thought back to everything that had happened to him during the trip.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Huli appeared in his arms, and Hui Yue felt shocked. The fox had followed him before, but she had vanished during their trip to the realm. Hui Yue just assumed that she had gone somewhere on her own, but he had not had the time to worry about her. He was sure that no matter where she went, he would not need to worry about this creature. He had long since realized that the strength of this beast was far stronger than he could comprehend. She might even be as strong as the Divine Beast Gods for all that he knew.</p><p dir="ltr">As the fox appeared in Hui Yue&apos;s arms, it snuggled up to him, and Hui Yue felt happiness to see her once more. He gently started stroking the soft black fur and returned to his thoughts about all the experiences he had. He had not had enough time to fully process everything that had happened to him recently.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">By examining their experiences, Hui Yue also gained further understanding and enlightenment.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was so focused on his thoughts that he did not notice the complicated expression on the face of the fox as it buried its head into the robe that Hui Yue was wearing. The fox seemed like it truly enjoyed his scent, and soon it fell asleep.</p><p dir="ltr">After an additional few hours, Hui Lei awoke and looked around. His face was filled with the utmost joy and disbelief. He had spent hours understanding all the changes that his body had undergone, but even so, he had not been able to understand it all. What he did understand was that his strength had risen by quite a bit. Maybe he had not gained a higher rank, but his body had taken a qualitative leap forward. His combat ability was many times stronger than before; his ability to absorb the essence of the heavens and the earth was many times better than before, and his strength had increased tremendously. All of this was gained from a little bit fire from his revered older brother.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking around, Hui Lei noticed that he was still within the room of his brother and he was slightly startled. He had forgotten where he was when he started cultivating and suddenly felt slightly embarrassed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He looked around and saw his older brother seated in a chair with a black fox in his arms. Hui Yue&apos;s eyes were closed, and it seemed as though he was sleeping, but one of his arms was slowly and gently stroking the fox&#x2019;s black fur. The fox was laying down, looking at Hui Lei with curious but lazy eyes.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Lei felt as though he was in a daze as he looked in the eyes of the fox. He completely forgot everything that was happening around him and just stared at this beast in his older brother&apos;s arms until it blinked its eyes and he was freed.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Lei felt his soul shake in fear and he instantly fled the room, not daring to look back. The small fox was so frightening, and he finally started to understand just how strong his magnificent brother truly was!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Did you need to frighten him that badly?&quot; Hui Yue asked with a tired voice. His eyes did not open nor did his arm cease petting the small fox in his arms.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He was not truly mad at her. His little brother had never before seen a truly strong being, and now he knew that there were heavens above the heavens, experts above experts.</p><p dir="ltr">Right after he said that the fox turned to look at him with big, contemplating eyes before a playful expression appeared within. Then suddenly the fox jumped from his lap and landed on the ground in front of him.</p><p dir="ltr">As she landed on the ground, the black-furred fox suddenly transformed into an incredibly alluring woman who was dressed in very tightly-fitted and extremely revealing black dress. Her body was completely developed in the right places, and any man, even Hui Yue, felt troubled looking at this heaven-defyingly beautiful woman. She was even more beautiful than the woman from the memory of the Vermilion Bird!</p><p dir="ltr">While the woman from the Vermilion Bird&apos;s memory was like an angel who had descended upon the earth, this black-clothed woman was like an alluring she-devil. She tempted all men with a sweet smile and her voluminous body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was completely stunned. He was so shocked that he almost couldn&#x2019;t process what was going on. Never did he imagine that this small fox that was constantly by his side would take the form of a woman, and such a tempting one at that! Hui Yue swallowed hard as he felt a great calamity arising.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But master, it was fun.&quot; The fox-woman said with a honeyed voice as she climbed closer to Hui Yue, causing the young man to feel slightly uneasy.</p><br></div><p></p>
