His Nine Peach Leaves seemed to vanish into nothingness as his Ten Suns formation shone brilliantly, and small explosions erupted with every move of the suns. They were filled with volatile energy, and the air was left distorted everywhere they flew past.</p><p>Hui Yue held the Celestial Sword in his hands and was ready to chop down at An He while Lan Feng was launching an attack of his own.</p><p>Lan Feng&apos;s phoenix shape was massive, and although it was agile and powerful, it was also slightly slower than An He.</p><p>Fortunately, Hui Yue and Lan Feng were in sync. They were used to working together and with merged souls they could sense what the other was planning before they even started to move.</p><p>Because of this, Lan Feng and Hui Yue had planned a pincer attack. They would always have one person behind An He, one person in front of him, and the Nine Peach Leaves attacking him from his blind spots.</p><p>As a result, when Hui Yue advanced, he had hoped that An He would avoid his attack, and allow for him to pass behind him. The result would be An He having Lan Feng and Hui Yue on opposite sides.</p><p>Unfortunately, An He saw through their plan. A smirk appeared on his face as he waved his hand and a large, black scythe appeared in his hand.</p><p>With his hair billowing in the wind, and with the three heavenly daos he had comprehended surrounding him, An He stood like an unshakable mountain in front of Hui Yue.</p><p>He lifted his scythe, and the moment that Hui Yue attacked, the scythe blocked the Celestial Sword. Sparks flew everywhere, and a loud resounding screech of the weapons colliding cried to the heavens.</p><p>The scythe was a sentient treasure; a treasure which An He had been bestowed by the Manor Lord upon becoming the third-ranked blood prince, and although he was unfamiliar with this specific weapon, An He and the weapon had a similar personality.</p><p>Both wished for nothing more than to slay all who stood in their way; they wanted nothing more than to see blood dye the heavens red.</p><p>Hui Yue was propelled backward and flew almost a hundred meters back, and the shockwave from the clash also decimated a full hundred or so Blood Demons that been too close to fight.</p><p>An He, on the other hand, was only forced to take half a step backward to steady himself, mainly because he did not have full control over the weapon. But the disparity between their strengths could be easily seen from this clash, and Hui Yue frowned while he felt his blood boiling.</p><p>The moment that Hui Yue was thrown back, Lan Feng released a resounding phoenix cry and flew higher into the heavens. He flapped his wings and the winds that ensued caused many Blood Demons in the surrounding area to struggle to stay in the air.</p><p>Lan Feng became a beam of light as he flew upwards in the sky. His speed constantly increased, and the Ancestral Worldpower in his body revolved around in his core.</p><p>Lan Feng reached high up in the heavens while Hui Yue unceasingly continued to exchange blows with An He, even though he was constantly being pushed further and further back.</p><p>As Lan Feng reached the right height, he hovered in the air for a short moment before he finally started to descend, using the Ancestral Worldpower in his body to power his Phoenix Descent.</p><p>This was the very first Ancestral Worldpower skill that they had learned, and when Hui Yue managed to fully understand it, Lan Feng had also gained full insight into it.</p><p>The Phoenix Descent was strong when Hui Yue used it, but it was an attack created by the Vermillion Bird, and it was much stronger in the wings of a phoenix.</p><p>Lan Feng descended much faster than Hui Yue had ever seen before. His speed was ever increasing and reaching a pace that was impossible to follow. Although he was not this fast normally, but his descent coupled with the use of his Ancestral Worldpower skill caused his speed to soar, and now he was near invisible.</p><p>Hui Yue kept An He in place while Lan Feng aimed straight for the top of An He&apos;s head.</p><p>As Lan Feng descended he superimposed the dao of life and the dao of the heavens on top of his body to strengthen himself even further.</p><p>Lan Feng braced himself. He was aware that this collision could possibly grievously wound him, but it was an attack he had to execute as it was one of his strongest and fastest attacks.</p><p>There was no time to test out the waters; they had to go for broke and use their most powerful attacks in the hope of ending the fight as soon as possible.</p><p>An He, on the other hand, held the advantage. He had more daos than Hui Yue and Lan Feng, and he had more Ancestral Worldpower since he had been a God for longer time than them.</p><p>In every single aspect, An He came out on top. He had more daos, more Ancestral Worldpower, a sentient treasure, and he was in the middle of the Blood Demon army with backup ready to jump in at any moment.</p><p>Although they were fighting in the midst of the Blood Demon army, they were constantly retreating due to Hui Yue being pushed back further and further, and they reached the border where the human army was fighting against the demons.</p><p>As they reached this point, Lan Feng finally came down from the skies; the heavens were trembling, and space was torn asunder as spatial tears appeared in his wake. This also caused Archaic Energy to pour out.</p><p>Lan Feng&apos;s body collided head first with An He, who had been so focused on Hui Yue that he had not sensed that the descending Lan Feng had already reached him.</p><p>However, An He had his entire body covered by his superimposed daos. His body was not refined, but with the assistance of the daos, he was able to make a nearly impregnable defense around his body.</p><p>Fortunately for Hui Yue and Lan Feng, he also needed to use the three daos to fight with, and he was incapable of putting too much focus on the daos that surrounded his body.</p><p>An He had also just recently comprehended his third heavenly dao. Although he could control all three heavenly daos, it was not as smooth as some of those old monsters who had comprehended the heavenly daos for millennia already.</p><p>Upon collision, an enormous boom exploded on the battlefield. A shockwave and sound that could be felt and heard in every single corner of the battlefield. It shook the air, ground, and the entirety of the Netherworld. The ground that was underneath Lan Feng and An He started cracking, and fissures appeared everywhere.</p><p>Both Lan Feng and An He screamed out, one was a phoenix cry the other was a deep groan of pain.</p><p>An He was stationary for only a second before he was shot back like a kite cut from its string, and he shot towards the ground. Blood could be seen dripping from the edge of his hair, though as for how serious the wound was, no one knew, but he was clearly wounded enough to bleed.</p><p>Not only was he wounded enough to bleed, but he was also clearly in pain. Unfortunately, he did not fall for more than a kilometer before he got his body under control and shot upwards once more. He held his scythe in his hands and was ready to swipe out at Lan Feng.</p><p>Lan Feng had also been wounded from the collision. His head was ringing, his vision blurry, and his body felt weak as it also was shot backward at a speed no less than when he had been using the Phoenix Descent.</p><p>Fortunately, Lan Feng was a divine beast, and his body was a refined body. Although his soul was shaking and he was dizzy, confused, and weak, he had not been wounded but just shaken, so after a moment he would be fine again.</p><p>An He, on the other hand, had finally shed blood, but Hui Yue did not give him even a moment to relax.</p><p>As An He reemerged in the heavens with the purpose of slaughtering Lan Feng with a single swipe of his scythe, Hui Yue arrived right in front of the newly transformed Blood Demon as a sinister grin appeared on his lips.</p><p>Hui Yue pointed forward, and two of the biggest suns of the Ten Suns formation shot out straight for An He.</p><p>An He snorted at Hui Yue and his attempt to attack him. He did not see a formation as a problem, not even a grandmaster formation, and he attacked with his scythe aiming to split the two suns in half.</p><p>No one present knew the difference between this Ten Suns formation and the previous ones.</p><p>Although the previous versions could be considered frightening and dangerous, they were nothing compared to the one Hui Yue had merged with his knowledge from his past star life. Every single sun was magnitudes stronger, and Hui Yue had infused them with the major dao of fire as well as his soulforce which carried with it the essence of his life as a star.</p><p>The scythe neatly cut through the two suns, and for a short moment, it seemed as if they would collapse, however, less than a second later a massive explosion ensued.</p><p>The explosion was extremely powerful. The suns had been filled with volatile energy, and this energy had been waiting for the smallest thing to set it off.</p><p>Now that the scythe had sliced through them small explosions appeared within the suns, and these explosions grew in size until they became all-encompassing engulfing An He in a blazing inferno.</p><p>Although this inferno was only fueled by one dao, the major dao of fire, it was also fueled by soulforce, an ancient power that should never be underestimated.</p><p>Hui Yue saw how An He was surrounded by fire, and he snickered as he used some more of his soulforce to form another two suns.</p><p>Although he knew that he was becoming stronger and that this attack was fatal to most experts, he was also aware that An He was not just anyone. He was capable of surviving almost anything, and his strength eclipsed Hui Yue and Lan Feng making it impossible for him to have already died.</p><p>Hui Yue suddenly felt incoming danger, and he retreated rapidly, but he was too slow.</p><p>A scythe came out from the blazing inferno and gorged out a large chunk of flesh from Hui Yue&apos;s side.</p><p>Blood started flowing, and Hui Yue&apos;s face went pale. This was a serious injury, but Hui Yue waved his hands, and a few pills appeared in his palm.</p><p>Hui Yue swallowed the pills instantly and felt how the blood flow stopped, but although these pills were strong, they were incapable of fully healing his wound.</p><p>The only option was to use the dao of life to heal himself, but then he would have less energy to use in the battle. He could also ignite some of his lifeforce to heal the wound, but that would also result in him becoming incapable of fighting at his best.</p><p>The moment Hui Yue retreated, the inferno was swallowed into a big sphere of darkness, and a burned and charred An He appeared in front of them.</p><p>Lan Feng flew down and hovered in front of Hui Yue, protecting him while the medicinal pill finished nourishing his body.</p><p>&quot;You two cockroaches are much more difficult to deal with than I had expected!&quot; An He sighed and shook his head. He tightened his grip on his scythe and started moving forward one step at a time.</p><p>With each step he moved, Hui Yue and Lan Feng felt their hearts tighten. They were injured and had tried so many attacks already, but although An He had been wounded, he was not wounded nearly enough considering the efforts they had put in.</p><p>On the other hand, Hui Yue&apos;s body was broken, and Lan Feng was still slightly dazed from the impact.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
