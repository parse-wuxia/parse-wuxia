It was carved from pure gold and jade, with pillars made from the same materials as the Worldpower Stones.</p><p>This pavilion was heavily guarded with guards wearing the same uniform as the guards that had been guarding the entrance to the realm wore. They were all of Immortal of Creation rank, and their demeanor was very intimidating. They kept the majority of the experts that came towards the pavilion on high alert.</p><p>Where the guards instilled fear in the majority of the experts, Hui Yue and his friends walked forward with casual smiles on their faces, and there were no signs of fear in their behavior. Their nonchalant behavior caused even more experts to be curious and stunned.</p><p>&quot;Halt!&quot; one of the guards called out. His voice displayed authority but no hostility nor friendliness.</p><p>&quot;What purpose do you young masters and ladies have with visiting our Blissful Pavilion today?&quot; He asked.</p><p>The guards did not ask everyone who appeared, but some of them were stopped and questioned, especially the stronger experts, and Hui Yue and his group made this guard feel a sense of danger.</p><p>Their casual expression and way of behaving were simply too abnormal. It was only the most supreme of experts that would dare show such a casual appearance in front of other Immortals of Creations.</p><p>&quot;We came to purchase some information,&quot; Hui Yue said truthfully in a polite manner. This was different from the guard who had stopped him and tried to wrest some extra money out of him, this guard was doing his job, and Hui Yue appreciated him for that.</p><p>&quot;Go get Long Tie!&quot; The guard called out, and another guard instantly vanished into the shop after which he came rushing out with a middle-aged man.</p><p>This middle-aged man was walking slowly, and every movement was casual as he glanced at everyone present. There was no contempt or arrogance in his eyes, but he had a noble air about him that made him seem more important than everyone else around.</p><p>As his eyes swept across Hui Yue and his friends, his indifferent eyes turned curious.</p><p>&quot;To think that the King of Hell himself has honored us with his presence,&quot; the man who had been referred to as Long Tie, said with a smile on his face.</p><p>Many had been observing what was happening and when they heard the words leave Long Tie&apos;s mouth, an uproar exploded out. A King of Hell was present? That was surely something that rarely happened, and even Hui Yue was surprised that he had been recognized.</p><p>Although he was no longer a King of Hell, he did not correct the man. The resurrection of the real Chujiang was still a secret, and thus he could say nothing.</p><p>&quot;To be met personally by the manager, you honor me,&quot; Hui Yue said as he cupped his hands and bowed fractionally.</p><p>The guard who had said to call Long Tie took a deep breath. He had known that these experts were extraordinary, but for one of them to be a King of Hell? Now that was something even he had never thought possible even in his wildest dreams.</p><p>&quot;You have done well,&quot; the manager Long Tie said to the guard as he patted him on his shoulder and took a token from his ring.</p><p>&quot;When I am done dealing with these experts, come visit me. Your services require a reward.&quot;</p><p>Having said this he turned to look at Hui Yue again, his face filled with one great smile, and he nodded his head repeatedly.</p><p>&quot;I heard that when the young master was promoted to become the new King Chujiang, you had yet to become an Immortal of Creation, yet here you are today with such overwhelming strength. Young master&apos;s strength has given this old one a great shock, and your talent leaves everyone else in the dust.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue knew that much of this was flattery. He worked with people, and as a manager of a pavilion such as this one, he knew which customers were good to have a great relationship with. He had clearly decided that Hui Yue and his group were people they would want a good relationship with. Thus he was not shy when it came to his flattery.</p><p>Since Hui Yue was interested in doing business with the Blissful Pavilion, he just smiled and returned the flattery with his own flattery.</p><p>&quot;Although I might have some talent, to compare my ability with manager Long Tie, it would still be far too early,&quot; He smiled, and the manager&apos;s smile turned even bigger than before.</p><p>It was rare for him to meet an important customer who was so humble. Although he knew that the two of them were exchanging flattery, the two ended up getting a good impression of each other.</p><p>&quot;Please, follow me inside,&quot; Long Tie said with a smile as he turned to leave, gesturing for Hui Yue and his friends to follow, which all of them did.</p><p>Inside the pavilion, servants, appraisers, and other staff all bowed towards Long Tie. Even those who were busy dealing with customers took the time to bow to him and anyone could see that he was greatly respected by everyone here.</p><p>Long Tie led them to a room lavishly decorated with many antiques, treasures, and precious materials.</p><p>&quot;So what can we do for you?&quot; Long Tie asked curiously while Hui Yue and the others sat down on some chairs that had been found and brought over for them.</p><p>&quot;We are here to purchase information. We need the newest information about the Archaic World. What worlds are unstable as of now and which worlds have just emerged and so on.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s request was reasonable. Everyone who came to the Blissful Realm wanted to get such information, and although it might be too trivial a task for the manager to usually deal with, he did not feel that it was beneath him to tell Hui Yue about this. Hui Yue was a King of Hell after all.</p><p>&quot;Well it is very simple,&quot; Long Tie said with a smile. &quot;There are three worlds which are very stable and easy to enter. These three worlds have been almost fully investigated, and although new treasures appear from within these worlds, all of them have lower and lower value.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These three worlds are the first you will encounter when you enter the Archaic World, and their names are the Endless Ruins, the Immortal Valley, and the Translucent Forest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Endless Ruins is one of the oldest worlds within the entire area, but the formation within it is incredibly powerful, and thus it is still stable.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Endless Ruins is as the name says, a place filled with ruins of an ancient civilization. These ruins were the best place to encounter sentient treasures in the past, but now it is mostly a place to gather treasures, herbs, and high-grade treasures such as weapons and armor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Immortal Valley is a world where fierce ancient beasts live in numerous numbers. This is the best place to hunt for a beast with an ancient bloodline, and it is also a good place to gather other materials from fierce beasts. These beasts also protect some very rare herbs, and some of them have even created their own weapons from the bones that they have stolen from other ancient beasts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Translucent Forest is the most mysterious of the three. The entire world is covered by a massive forest made from glass, and within this forest, there are countless godly herbs and treasures hidden within. It used to be a burial ground for supreme experts from days long past, and these graves are sought after by everyone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Translucent Forest is dangerous and filled with fierce beasts, but the most dangerous thing in the Translucent Forest is the ghosts. Since many experts were buried there, some of them had their souls stay behind, and they connected with the world. When they did this, they were able to remain in the Translucent Forest and hunt anyone who set foot near their grave.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These three worlds are the most secure of all the worlds, and there is no chance that they will collapse anytime soon. They have all almost fully been explored, and most of the big treasures have already been taken away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Next we have a whole group of minor realms. Many of these realms are stable. Most are as big as the Blissful Realm and only contain ancient ruins, but within these ruins, many treasures can be found.&quot;</p><p>We do not have much information about these realms. They are constantly arriving at the front of the Archaic World. Sometimes they will collapse, other times they will slowly drift back into the Archaic World again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Two new worlds have appeared in the outer perimeter of the Archaic World. One is very unstable and can collapse at any time, while the other is fairly stable. We expect it will one day become the fourth safe world to enter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For now not many have explored it, and major treasures are being brought out from within frequently. It still does not have a name; we just refer to it as the new world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Many wondrous treasures have appeared, and even our Blissful Pavilion is hiring mercenaries to explore the world for treasures to sell to us.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. &quot;There is a legend about a realm which is filled with herbs as far as the eye can see, and I hear it even has a sentient pill living within,&quot; he said casually. &quot;Has anyone ever been able to find out if this world is real?&quot;</p><p>Long Tie sent a meaningful glance at Hui Yue and contemplated for some time.</p><p>&quot;We don&apos;t know for sure,&quot; he said finally. &quot;There was one who claimed to see this realm in the middle area of the Archaic World, but he dared not enter. He was scared almost to death by just staying within the middle area and fled shortly after arriving.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Although he fled he claimed to have seen such a world. The strange thing is that he claimed that there was a cultivator living in this world, but it would be strange for anyone to be still living within the Archaic World. Only ancient fierce beasts can live there! Cultivators definitely would not be able to survive in the Archaic World. The worlds are simply too unstable.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. Anyone who saw him would think that the information was not much to him, but inwardly both he and Lan Feng were cheering loudly. This was exactly what they wanted to hear, and he was excited. It seemed that they needed to enter the middle area of the Archaic World.</p><p>Hui Yue already knew that the Archaic World was split into the outer, middle, and inner regions. The outer regions were the ones where there was the least danger. This was the area where most people traveled, and this was where the survival rate was around fifty percent. Although it was the safest of all the regions, it was still brutal.</p><p>The middle region was even more dangerous. At least ninety percent of the experts that entered the middle region died while the inner region was the most dangerous. It had not even been possible for anyone to reach the inner region in eons, or at least no one ever said they had.</p><p>Having gotten all the information he needed, Hui Yue gave the manager a bag filled with Worldpower Stones. The information was not free, and the questions he had asked had all been answered perfectly.</p><p>The manager accepted the bag with a big smile. &quot;If you ever need anything, please do not hesitate to come back,&quot; he said as he walked all of them to the door. Seeing that this group was being walked by the manager, everyone who knew Long Tie was staring at the group with respect in their eyes.</p><p>As they left the pavilion, Hui Yue sighed as he looked at the massive bazaar in front of him, and he gently placed his head in his hands.</p><p>&quot;We are going to play hide and seek now,&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;We never agreed on where to meet or when so let&#x2019;s start walking through the bazaar until we manage to find the rest of our friends.&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
