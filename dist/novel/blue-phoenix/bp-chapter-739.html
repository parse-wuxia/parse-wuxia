I bet they really can&apos;t bear to part with it which is why they set such a high price for it!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#x2019;s definitely possible, especially if you get you slay some of the stronger experts!&quot;</p><p>&quot;As if you are strong enough to kill those crazy demon generals. Be careful that you don&apos;t run into Nightmare or the Ghastly Lord or someone else!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue listened to everyone who spoke, and he understood that another treasure had been brought out to lure these hunters into slaying more Blood Demons.</p><p>While most of the mercenaries were busy looking at the rewards and drooling over this famous life-saving treasure that had appeared out of nowhere, Hui Yue headed towards the opposite side of the room.</p><p>Here there was a large map which showed the different worlds of the western region. It had which worlds had already succumbed to the Blood Demons and which ones were controlled by humans.</p><p>It showed where the main demon forces were concentrated, and it also showed the location of specific hunter squads.</p><p>Alongside this, it showed the names of a few blood demon squad who no humans had managed to flee from. The only thing that had been found after them were the corpses of humans and some of these groups had been named after the way they treated the corpses or the way the humans had died. As for how many of these groups there were, no one knew for sure.</p><p>These experts gave an extra thousand contribution points, and when Hui Yue saw this, a smile blossomed on his face.</p><p>&quot;If I can kill them, do you think that the elder from before will consider it as if I have killed two Blood Demons?&quot; he asked with childish naivety, but Lan Feng just sighed. He shook his head and patted Hui Yue&apos;s shoulder.</p><p>&quot;You have to find Blood Demons by the number, not by the contribution points. To him, it does not matter if it is a Primordial Immortal or one of these Nightmare or Ghastly Lord groups. You should not try and find a way to kill two chickens with one blow, just accept your fate.&quot;</p><p>Hearing the reason in Lan Feng&apos;s voice, Hui Yue sighed. &quot;In that case, let us get going to the area where there are many demons. We will just slaughter our way through the hundred thousand blood demons we need to slay.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue was slightly dejected as he turned around and stepped out of the Gate of Retribution.</p><p>Hui Yue was acutely aware of his task, and although he could easily kill a hundred thousand Blood Demons, it was hard when they were spread across the western region, hiding from sight and only appearing in small groups of ten.</p><p>Hui Yue used all his cunning, his knowledge, and his abilities to locate these Blood Demons. As soon as he saw them, he would be filled with annoyance because of the work they had caused him to put into hunting them. Thus he would slaughter them instantly, never showing mercy.</p><p>Watching Hui Yue&#x2019;s actions, the elder was more and more surprised. Hui Yue was decisive. He was strong. He was cunning, and he was a born leader.</p><p>At the start, he had thought that a hundred thousand demons would be impossible for him to find, but as time went by, he realized that this young man might just be able to accomplish the task.</p><p>Just as Hui Yue had eradicated the fifth group of experts that day, he suddenly felt that someone was rushing his way; he could feel the thick killing intent that surrounded the arriving experts.</p><p>&quot;Jiejiejiejie, look at this a few delicious looking lambs,&quot; a withered and dry voice sounded out, and as Hui Yue turned around, he rose an eyebrow in surprise.</p><p>In front of him were twelve Blood Demons their leader was a small man who looked like a mummy. His skin was parched, and while his eyes were purple like the other demons, they shone unlike anything Hui Yue had seen before. A strange light seemed to emerge from within.</p><p>Hui Yue narrowed his eyes as he looked at this man in front of him. He was without a doubt a powerful opponent.</p><p>&quot;So who are you?&quot; Hui Yue asked. Although this expert was strong, Hui Yue did not fear him. It was clear that he was a demon that gave extra contribution points, an expert that had killed numerous human cultivators, but even so, Hui Yue wasn&apos;t worried. Hui Yue was just as dangerous to the demons as this demon was to humans.</p><p>&quot;Jiejiejiejie,&quot; the man cackled with his strange laughter that sounded as if a door&apos;s hinges needed to be oiled. &quot;You are a funny little human,&quot; he said with a smile on his parched face as the wrinkles all over helped frame his mouth that had half the teeth missing.</p><p>&quot;I believe you people call me Nightmare, jiejiejiejie,&quot; he continued to cackle, and behind him, the demons were all laughing out loud. They brandished their weapons, and their faces were filled with savage smiles.</p><p>However, their smiles did turn rather awkward when they saw that Hui Yue and the others stared at them as if they were looking at dead people. There was a certain confidence in this group which no other group of experts they had come across had before.</p><p>Hui Yue snickered, &quot;Nightmare. I see. You are worth quite a lot of contribution points. I wonder if you are able to live up to the reputation that you have.&quot;</p><p>The more Hui Yue spoke, the more insulted Nightmare became. His eyes shone more intensely than before, his smile faltered, and his remaining teeth gritting against each other.</p><p>Hui Yue knew that this Nightmare was a serious opponent; he was not like the others he had killed so far, but he also knew that he had many benefits that other cultivators did not have.</p><p>He unsheathed his Sword of Icy Tempest, and the air around him started rumbling as the major daos rushed towards him.</p><p>There was no display of these various daos, but the expression of everyone present on the demon&apos;s side turned grim.</p><p>Nightmare was capable of sensing that Hui Yue was superimposing the dao around his weapon and himself forming a shield.</p><p>The elder who had masked himself completely almost revealed himself in shock. He had heard that Hui Yue was a member of the younger generation, but even so, he was already able to superimpose the dao, and there were so many of them!</p><p>&quot;This child is a heavenly sent genius! He was born to fight the Blood Demons! Born to be a shooting star in this era. I was a genius of the last Blood Demon war, but I fear that I will be dwarfed by this boy. It really was no injustice that my great-grandson fell to such a great cultivator.&quot;</p><p>At the start, he had still felt hatred towards Hui Yue. He had wanted to trouble him and gave him a task he could not achieve. He wanted to watch this prideful young man tremble and fall to his knees. He wanted him to beg for forgiveness and cry his eyes out in an attempt to stay alive.</p><p>But as he had followed him, he saw that Hui Yue was not the person he had expected. He was friendly towards any human who did not provoke him, and even those who were not overly polite were ignored instead of being killed.</p><p>The elder had thought that anyone who treated Hui Yue with disrespect would be killed on sight, but he saw that Hui Yue just ignored them. They were far below his strength, and he could not even be bothered to act against them.</p><p>From this, he understood that his great-grandson had truly done something outrageous to enrage Hui Yue enough to kill him.</p><p>During the whole time this elder had watched Hui Yue, he had never seen his full strength. All the time he would simply wave his hand and the Blood Demons would fall like flies. They would drop dead with their heads severed from their necks.</p><p>Now that he was up against a formidable opponent, Hui Yue narrowed his eyes and did not hold back. Even a tiger used its full strength while hunting a rabbit.</p><p>Although he did not feel that this Nightmare was capable of killing him, he still felt that he might be able to escape if he did not manage to wound him quickly.</p><p>He did not even place Nightmare&apos;s companions in his eyes. He flicked his hand after which wave after wave of the dao swept out. It was a fast attack, and the dao waves were as fast as light as they reached the demons.</p><p>Amongst all of them only Nightmare managed to dodge, and soon the scent of blood filled the air. The sounds of screams, cries, and moans could be heard in the distance.</p><p>Every demon, apart from Nightmare, had been hit by the wave and had sustained injuries of various degrees.</p><p>&quot;Kill them. Kill them all. Do not leave any alive,&quot; Hui Yue ordered with a voice that was so cold that everyone shuddered, and his friends all sprung into action.</p><p>So far Hui Yue had killed every single demon on his own, but this time the others acted, and the elder&apos;s eyes grew even wider seeing this. All of them were young. Some of them were even younger than Hui Yue, but even so, everyone was an Immortal of Creation.</p><p>All of them had at least comprehended one major dao while some of them had comprehended more than that. There was even a monster amongst them. Pei Ziqi was a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing. When he saw her battle axe, he felt a cold chill down his spine.</p><p>Although he was incredibly strong, he understood that this woman was not to be trifled with. She could not harm him, but her brute strength covered with superimposed daos was simply too outstanding. Anyone who she ran into would be beaten to a bloody pulp.</p><p>The beast gods were all cheering loudly. Their bodies were in their original forms, and they all split up as they saw that the less injured Blood Demons trying to escape.</p><p>The most injured ones were executed easily by Lao who also took on the task of beheading every single dead Blood Demon. Hui Yue had told them that beheading their enemy was the best way to ensure that they were dead.</p><p>Soul energy started to fill the air as the souls were being shattered one after another, and in the meantime, Hui Yue was fighting Nightmare.</p><p>Nightmare was strong. He was incapable of superimposing the daos, but he had been born as a favored son of the heavens with five major daos comprehended.</p><p>These daos surrounded him. Windblades shot towards Hui Yue, and volatile fireballs were hovering in the air. Long shadows were intertwined with light, but Hui Yue ignored all of it as he shot towards the withered mummy with his sword held in both his hands.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
