Although the Formation Master&apos;s debate was a relatively small event, it was still something that everyone knew about. Therefore when they heard that the two champions both came from the Celestial Sword Sect, everyone in the Celestial Sword Sect&#x2019;s World, direct descendants, those in the guardian sects, and mortals alike were all shocked and filled with pride for their world.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They expected that their sect would come in last in the younger generation&#x2019;s rankings again, but when it was revealed that they had won, everyone was ecstatic, and even those who had usually bad-mouthed Hui Yue had nothing to say about him this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue stopped living at the Formation Master&apos;s palace, but he did not return to his father&apos;s mountain either. Huli and himself had been given a valley located close to the center of the massive mountain range, and this valley was to be the home of him and his family in the future whenever they were at the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had been awarded quite a few contribution points from winning the Formation Master&apos;s debate, but even so, he kept challenging the guards every week for the sake of more contribution points. Now he was no longer able to use the formations of the Formation Palace free of charge, and he had many other things he needed to use contribution points on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue spent his time with Huli in their valley focused on the minor daos of the wind. Since he was assisted by Huli, who had already comprehended the major dao of the wind, she helped him as much as she could. Although it was impossible for her to impart her own enlightenments to Hui Yue, she still tried her best. Everyone understood the dao differently, and their way of comprehending it was different from person to person.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, it was impossible for others to impart their knowledge of the dao to others, but even so, it was still possible to give a few pointers about them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue&apos;s lifestyle quickly fell into a calm routine. He would dedicate his time during the day to comprehending the dao of the wind and then at night he increased his Ancestral Worldpower pool.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He would visit the Divine Beast World from time to time to see how everyone&apos;s cultivation was coming along, and to see how his two kids, Lao and Jo, were doing.</p><p dir="ltr">Lao was constantly competing with Hui Lei. Both of them refused to give up to the other and always struggling to get the upper hand when cultivating.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, Hui Lei and Lao were almost the same age, and although they always competed with one another, they valued each other like real brothers.</p><p dir="ltr">Although these two brothers would fight one another all the time, they were both incredibly humble in front of Jo. Although Jo was the one with the lowest cultivation amongst them all, she was truly frightening in a real fight. Neither Hui Lei nor Lao had the power to beat her.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These three all loved it the most when Hui Yue came to visit them; they would be filled with excitement and love. Hui Yue was the one who had given them their chance to become more than just poor children.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Lei had his parents, someone Lao nor Jo never had, he too had lived through some tough times, and this made the three of them even happier whenever they thought about all the things that Hui Yue had given them. All the doors he had opened for them, and all the hope he had given them.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Sha Yun was in the Formation of Life breaking through to becoming a God ranked cultivator. While she was busy doing so, Hui Yue had Ye Ling, Zhu Jun, Luo Qiang, and Xiao Ning looking after the world for him.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, it was possible for Hui Yue to focus even more on his cultivation. Once a month he would enter the City of Endless Clouds and meet up with Wei and Deng Wu. Both of them were advancing at an astonishing pace since they did not have to worry about money.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Not only them, every one of the other beasts from the Divine Beast World were doing shockingly well in their respective sects. Cai Jie was the one who came to visit the least, but he was also the furthest away.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not worry about Cai Jie. He knew that this young man was filled with as much determination as Hui Yue and Lan Feng to end An He, and he was also at the same time worried that Hui Yue might not be his long lost martial brother.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he cared about the current Hui Yue, it was impossible for him not to see the similarities between the two martial brothers. He was filled with hope that his brother, who had died all those years before, was still alive.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Time flowed like water as the seasons came and went. Years flowed by without anyone noticing. The only thing that changed was that Sha Yun and the others joined Hui Yue in the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s World.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sha Yun joined the sect as Hui Yue&apos;s second fiance. There had been quite a bit of opposition towards them getting engaged. This was because she did not have a big dowry and her cultivation was lacking as she was a new God with no backing, but eventually, Hui Yue, Huli, and Pei Tian managed to convince the others that Hui Yue was allowed to marry for just love.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue and Lan Feng both advanced by leaps and bounds. While Hui Yue had decided to focus on the minor daos under the dao of the wind, Lan Feng was as always focused on the dao of fire.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the years passed Lan Feng became faster and faster at comprehending the daos. It was as if the more fire daos he understood, the easier it was for him to comprehend the next, and Hui Yue found that it was the same for him with the daos of the wind.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Life in the Celestial Sword Sect was calm. For them a year was the same as a day for a mortal, and no one even batted an eye when fifty years flew by in a flurry.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">By now everyone who followed Hui Yue had become Gods and had joined the various guardian sects. Everyone spent every day increasing their strength.</p><p dir="ltr">There were still many that were unhappy with Hui Yue, but he lived such a calm, silent life and troubled no one, so the elders who had previously wished to get rid of him were unable to do anything.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There had been no more assassination attempts against Hui Yue, and no one had caused problems for him. As the years went by everyone slowly came to accept that Hui Yue, the most talented youth of their younger generation, was indeed a part of the sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Fifty years went by like this. The Frozen General had long since become a God and had left the Divine Beast World behind. He had ventured out into the vast galaxy looking for a certain expert named Sang Young.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not know who Sang Young was, but after listening to the Frozen General talk about him, it seemed that this man was a notorious trickster who did not hesitate to threaten and beat people to get what he wanted. He tricked and cheated just about anyone, and the Frozen General had been one of his victims.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Where most had just accepted their loss and given up finding this cultivator, the Frozen General had never given up, and he said he would chase him down with everything he had.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had wished him all the best in his pursuit, and the two had left each other on friendly terms. Hui Yue had even offered the Frozen General a position in one of the Guardian Sects so that he could strengthen himself, but he was too eager, too impatient, to wait around and turned it down. Shortly after, he left the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s World and started traveling the vast galaxy.</p><p dir="ltr">In these fifty years, not much had happened. The Divine Beast World was constantly getting more and more nourished, and the Formation of Life was becoming stronger and stronger making the world soar on the heavenly rankings.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Jo and Lao were both invited into the inner sect as they were Hui Yue&apos;s adoptive children, and so was his younger brother.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start, these three youngsters had been alienated by the rest of the sect due to them not being direct descendants, but after a bit of time, they had won the respect and friendliness of the younger generation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They had proven their worth in the sparring fields time and time again, and they would always work hard at their chores and with their cultivation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue could not help but chuckle when he noticed how his younger brother, Hui Lei, and his adoptive daughter Jo would sneak out together and spend time in the City of Endless Clouds together.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They would hold hands whenever they thought no one was looking and they would send tender smiles to one another. Although they tried to keep it a secret, they really couldn&#x2019;t deceive the older experts.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sha Yun and Huli had still not become married to Hui Yue as he said that he wished to wait until Wang Ju Long was with them again, and no one urged them to do so. Hui Yue was still very young for a God so although he was engaged, forcing him to marry that early was not something they would do.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">During these fifty years, Hui Yue and Lan Feng worked harder than anyone else. They had not slept a single night and had cultivated almost none stop. Hui Yue had only taken breaks when visiting his friends in the City of Endless Clouds or going to the Divine Beast World to look after it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their hard work had paid off. He had focused almost entirely on comprehending the dao and was currently only a few daos away from having completely comprehended the dao of wind.</p><p dir="ltr">Lan Feng, who had been swifter than him was only one dao away from having comprehended the full dao of fire, and this was a reason to celebrate.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">During this time, Hui Yue had also spent some time on formations and had now compressed a full seven hundred and sixty-one seals. Only Pei Bai had more seals than him in the entire Celestial Sword Sect, and Hui Yue had been to the Formation Master&apos;s debate more than once, winning it every time.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had been to many banquets, gatherings, and events in these fifty years. He had met many people whom he now considered his friends and comrades. He had participated in many missions around the Celestial Sword World making him completely familiar with the world he lived in.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Fifty years had gone by in a flash. For Hui Yue this time felt satisfying as he inched closer and closer to his goal to become an Immortal of Creation. This was because he wanted to leave the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s World and start searching for the Alchemist God. Soon, he would be able to resurrect Wang Ju Long!&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Yue!&quot; Someone suddenly called out, and Hui Yue who was stunned instantly turned around to see who was calling. The speaker was one of the fairly well-known Immortals of Creation of the inner sect guards, but despite this guard&#x2019;s reputation, he was incredibly polite when speaking with Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The elders requests your presence. It seems that something is happening!&quot;&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
