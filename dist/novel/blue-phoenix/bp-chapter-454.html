When he opened his eyes, no one around him was able to understand what happened to him, but he knew his body had to rest while he refined and got the massive influx of energy under control. All the chaotic energies had been successfully refined, and as a result, his body underwent a miraculous change. He could feel his upper dantian flooded with energy. His Wu Wei core was growing rapidly expanding allowing for him to become much more powerful than before. Although he was still a Saint ranked expert, he could not help but feel that his strength was on par with those very few top tier Saints. The likes of the Frozen General, Wan Qiao, or Li Xiaopeng might not necessarily be his match any longer.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ahem.&quot; The bull cleared his throat as he moved towards Hui Yue, finally taking the time to speak with him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have never seen that black energy you used before...&quot; He started. &quot;Not even the divine masters knew about this energy, how do you know about it? Is it perhaps a technique you gained from a supreme expert that roamed the heavens?&quot; The bull was interested in this energy and how it had appeared in this world, but Hui Yue just shook his head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The divine beasts naturally do not know about it because I created it on my own. I am of mixed blood. Not only do I have dantians with the ability to cultivate like a human, but I also have a beast core with the ability to cultivate like a beast. Mixing these two energies together creates this volatile energy. However, it is not at all easy to merge. It takes quite some time to merge and refine even a small amount, and today I used up half of the energy I had managed to create over the last few years.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not explain about the green pearl nor the blue cloud. Although he admired and was grateful to this bull, he was not going to tell him about his closely guarded secrets. He never knew if this bull would suddenly decide to raise the difficulty of their challenge just because Hui Yue had hidden strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing Hui Yue&apos;s answer the bull was shocked. He had heard about mixed blooded creatures before but none of them had both dantians and beast cores. No matter what age he thought back to, he could not find even the slightest memory of a creature who had both a beast core and dantians.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I see...&quot; The bull was amazed. Truthfully this bull did not have the ability to make the trials harder than they already were, but he was still amazed by these youngsters. He was getting more and more certain that the Formation of Life would finally choose a new guardian, and that he would be able to leave this deserted realm and once more roam the worlds outside. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;In this case, let&#x2019;s move onto the next trial.&quot; The bull said, and the world around them warped once more as the current scenery changed into something else.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When Hui Yue focused, he found that they were now inside a massive building, seated on the floor in a large stone hall. However, the air was chilled, and it felt even colder than it had when they were traveling through the mountain range.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Senior bull.&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously as he looked around. &quot;You keep calling this a realm. What exactly is the difference between a realm and a world?&quot; He understood that both were created by Gods, yet even so, it seemed that they were not the same.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at Hui Yue with a deep glance, the bull could not help but wonder why Hui Yue had asked such a question. Most who had entered this realm before could not tell that there was a difference between a realm and a world yet Hui Yue had noticed. Explaining the differences to him was not a bad idea.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;As you know, Gods are capable of creating worlds. For something to be called a world it needs to contain living beings who are able to evolve and sustain themselves from the world.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Realms are usually broken worlds or worlds which were failed while they were being formed. After failure, they become a small pocket dimension within the vast space where the worlds are like shining stars.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The world that my masters, the divine beasts, created is a real world, and it is even ranked as one of the top ten thousand worlds, able to create a crowned sovereign.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This, on the other hand, is just a realm that the Vermilion Bird set up on a whim. He never got to finish it and therefore it was always just a broken world used for nothing before they created the Formation of Life.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Most realms cannot exist without being attached to a world, and this small realm has been attached to the Divine Beast World. It is an unstable realm, and as soon as the Formation of Life is removed, the realm will collapse.&quot; The bull explained.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Right now it only exists because it is supported by the dense essence of the heavens and earth and the great amount of Ancestral Worldpower from the formation. When it is moved everything in here will collapse, but at the same time, the energy within the world of the divine beasts will see an increase. This is because as of right now only a small fraction is able to slip through between the two worlds.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Listening to the words of the bull, Hui Yue finally understood the differences between a realm and a world, and he also somewhat realized that creating a world was nowhere as simple as he had expected.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thank you senior for the explanation.&quot; He said humbly with a nod of his head. &quot;Please explain the next trial we will undergo.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">He no longer had time to waste on something as esoteric as creating worlds. They had already been within this world for quite a long time, and he wished to return as soon as possible. He wished to become a God and fulfill the many plans he had for the future.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Right.&quot; The bull cleared his throat as he looked at the ones in front of him, his eyes showing some tenderness. It was clear that he had gotten to like these youngsters from the time they had spent together within this fire realm.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This next trial is the most challenging so far.&quot; He warned them. &quot;Unlike the ones where you are capable of passing through with sheer strength, this one will test your determination and willpower. It will test your heart of martial arts and your eagerness to succeed.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This test cannot be passed with power at all. You will enter a trance where you will experience different things. While these experiences are an illusion, they are as real as anything else your soul experiences. Be careful, if your soul dies within these illusions then you will truly die; your soul will never again return to your body staying eternally trapped in your new reality.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have warned you. If you do not feel that you have the heart of a martial artist, then you should back away now.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone looked at one another. Although the words caused them to feel slightly worried none of them were willing to back down</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I might only be interested in food but my martial heart has grown increasingly stronger during the time we have been here; I am sure of my own heart.&quot; Jo suddenly said, and after she finished speaking the others nodded their heads. All of them walked the martial path; all of them were geniuses and believed in their own determination and their own heart.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing that all of them were so determined, none backing down, the bull could do nothing but sigh in amazement. These experts were very young, but they feared nothing in their pursuit of the apex of cultivation. It was clear that he was hoping for the best, yet amongst all the trials, most had failed here. Therefore, the bull could not help but be nervous.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;At least one of you will perish in this trial.&quot; He said seriously as he looked at them. &quot;Do you think that gaining the Formation of Life is a walk in the park? Believing that only one of you will die is already a very generous estimation of your abilities. If you are unlucky, only half may survive or even less!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The bull hoped that at least some of them would back out, but their eyes were filled with determination; it was clear that all of them were willing to give their all to improve and pass this trial.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing the bull took out his final trump card.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The next trial is the trial of talent. This trial is also an individual one, and only by passing the trial will you be able to reach the Formation of Life. You do not all need to go through these trials to obtain the Formation, just one person passing is enough. This way you can ensure that you will not have any casualties in your group!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The bull had preferred not to say anything but seeing such talent in these children, their level-headedness, and accomplishments, he did not want any of them to lose their lives in this trial.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was touched by the gentleness showed by this bull, but he still shook his head. &quot;Many thanks senior for the kind words.&quot; He began but looking at all his friends a smile shone on his face. &quot;However, we went through this trial together. We will always have each other&apos;s side, and although this trial is dangerous, I do not doubt in the martial hearts of any of my companions. We went through this trial of fire together, and we will leave having passed all the trials together as well. There is no need to be overly worried about us, should anyone die here then I will stake my life to go to the Netherworld to resurrect them when I become a God.&quot; The casual way Hui Yue mentioned resurrection stunned the bull but moments after he laughed out loud.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Go to the Netherworld to resurrect your dear ones? Yes, that is indeed a possibility but to do so, you will need to trade something of equal value for the life of the person you want to resurrect.&quot; The bull laughed. &quot;Yanluo will never let his souls go! He controls the Netherworld with an iron fist. You would need either immense power or something he wants to make him agree. Still, for some reason, I feel that it might be possible for you in the future, so I will say no more and allow everyone to enter this Trial of Determination. Who knows, perhaps you will really give me another surprise and all of you will survive.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The friends looked at one another, and all their faces were filled with determination and excitement. None of them had ever had their martial heart tested before, but they all felt that they had unwavering determination; thus, they felt no fear for this test, only curiosity.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully the bull&apos;s words had affected them, but upon hearing that Hui Yue was willing to stake his life for them to be reunited even after death, they no longer feared the test. Even if they were to fail and perish, they would be saved by Hui Yue. In their hearts, he had already become a shining star of constant hope, a person in whom they trusted completely. He was someone whom they were willing to follow, even in death.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was aware of just how high a place he had in the hearts of his friends, but he did not wish for any of them to die. He understood the words of the bull. Currently, he had nothing which could please Yanluo, the ruler of the Netherworld and thus he needed all his friends alive. Still, this trial was not one he feared. He had grown up with all his friends present, and he knew that the martial way was what mattered the most to them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Let&#x2019;s begin!&quot; Hui Yue ordered, and they all found a seat on the cold, hard ground. Everyone closed their eyes and awaited the start of the trial.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
