Big brother?&quot; The youth&apos;s voice had turned faint, and there was a mixture of emotions within his voice. One of the emotions was doubt while another was fear. There was some hesitation and disbelief hidden in his voice as well.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Little Lei, it&apos;s me.&quot; Hui Yue said with a gentle smile on his face. Looking at this young man, he could not believe how long it had been since he last saw his little brother.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Back when he lived in Riluo City, he would come home to visit from time to time and play with his younger brother, but that was when he was an infant and later on a toddler. That was so many years ago that Hui Lei did not completely remember this handsome man as being his older brother. His memory of his older brother was hazy, and he couldn&apos;t clearly remember the two of them interacting.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Hui Lei greets you.&quot; He suddenly said, straightening his back and bowing deeply in front of his brother, stunning Hui Yue. Last time he had seen this child, he had been just a toddler, but now he was a young man. His behavior clearly showed that he was not sure how to treat the sudden arrival of this big brother of his.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t stand on ceremony little Lei.&quot; Hui Lifen suddenly said with a smile on her face as she gestured for the young man to enter the room. Seeing his mother gesturing for him to enter, he instantly entered. Hui Yue stood up and went to fetch the last chair within the room and placed it next to the other three. He then sat down once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing his older brother go out of his way to get him a chair and not leave it for him to do himself, caused warmth to grow in his heart.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You two brothers should spend more time together.&quot; Hui Guang suddenly said. &quot;Little Yue has reached the pinnacle of cultivation and will be able to guide you down your path in a way that no one else can. We are getting old, and since our cultivation is low, we won&#x2019;t be around for much longer.&quot; Hui Guang sighed. &quot;But our two children are our pride and joy. Both are talented in cultivation and will live for a very long time. When we are gone, you will only have one another. You will need to rely on one another more than ever.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head seriously but truthfully he was shocked. He had never thought about the fact that his parents had never cultivated and therefore never managed to extend their lifespan. Frowning for some time, he was pondering on this issue.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I won&apos;t allow you to die just yet.&quot; He said stubbornly. &quot;I might not be able to give you eternal life, but I can help you increase your lifespan for at least a few thousand years.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this everyone was shocked, but Hui Yue didn&#x2019;t notice as he was in deep thought. &apos;What do you plan on doing? Rely on the lifeforce and simply transfer it directly to your family like the witch used to do in your previous life?&apos; Lan Feng asked curiously, but Hui Yue just kept thinking.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;I think I will use a few different methods.&apos; He mused. &apos;First I will refine their bodies with the Nirvana Phoenix Flame. I also need to refine the bodies of all our friends with it so that their basics are improved before they become Gods. Doing another three people will not be too much of a loss.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Secondly, I plan on using the few ingredients I have left from the Grave of the Unknown to make three Silvermoon&#x2019;s Pills. One for each of them. If I have managed to purify their bodies first and then they take Silvermoon&#x2019;s Pill afterward, they will be able to become at least King ranked experts. They might even surpass that rank depending on how great their talents are.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Finally, I will transfer lifeforce to them whenever they are close to the end of their lifespan. This way I should be able to keep them alive for quite some time. Even though I doubt they will become Gods, I should be able to help them live for quite a long time. Also, they will be so strong that they can roam this world together and experience it.&apos;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;What do you plan to do about your little brother? He is quite talented, but he has been forced to study on his own since he was a child. He has rushed through the ranks and therefore his foundation is not ideal. Do you also plan to give him Silvermoon&#x2019;s Pill to solidify his foundations and make him able to keep walking down the path of cultivation?&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue scoffed. &apos;What a stupid question.&apos; He said. &apos;Of course, I am going to give him the pill. If he can train to become a Saint, I&apos;ll even let him step into the Formation of Life and become a God. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the Formation of Life unless you are a Saint.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Well... in theory it&#x2019;s possible, but one needs to be able to walk through the pressure of the formation and to accomplish such a task, one needs to be a Saint. If someone weaker were to try, they would die on the spot.&apos; Hui Yue mused, but after a bit, he smiled. &apos;I believe in my little brother. He should be able to become a Saint. If I help him become a King with a solid foundation, he will be able to become a Saint. My parents, on the other hand, will most likely never be able to become more than an Emperor.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Although they too will have their foundations improved greatly, they are no longer young. The older one gets, the harder cultivation becomes. They have never trained before, and even becoming an Emperor will be a very hard task. Even if they manage to reach such a level, their abilities are likely to be weaker than that of other Emperors who have cultivated their whole lives. Cultivating and fighting does not come naturally to them.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue sighed. Although he could do much to help his parents, he was not in a position to suddenly give them back their youth. All he could do was help them to the best of his ability, the rest would depend on them.</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue was busy chatting with Lan Feng, and thinking about what to do, his family observed him with curiosity. Especially Hui Lei, who was looking at him intently. He grew up hearing how amazing and wonderful his older brother was. This made Hui Lei incredibly proud time and time again, but he was also worried about what his older brother felt for him. Had he been forgotten? Did he even care about him? Had he not returned home because he suddenly had a younger brother? It was hard to tell and as the years passed by more and more doubt grew in Hui Lei&apos;s heart.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly a smile spread on Hui Yue&apos;s face and his closed eyes opened. &quot;Little Lei, come here.&quot; He said as he beckoned for his little brother to come closer, and Hui Lei did not dare delay.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I am going to put some energy into your body. It will be in the shape of a small flame, and as this flame dissipates into your body, you will become many times stronger than you are now. It will not help your cultivation base as such, but your body will be remade. It will be rebuilt, and all the impurities will be expelled. It will be of great benefit to you in the future.&quot; Hui Yue explained seriously as he looked at his younger brother, and Hui Lei&apos;s eyes grew as he heard what Hui Yue said. He was incomparably excited.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing the excitement on his little brother&apos;s face, Hui Yue chuckled and raised his hand placing it on Hui Lei&apos;s shoulder. The sudden touch caused Hui Lei to be startled, but he did not move. Hui Yue closed his eyes and summoned forth a wisp of the Nirvana Phoenix Flame which he then passed through his body and into Hui Lei&apos;s body.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Lei felt heat enter his body from Hui Yue&apos;s hand, but before he had the chance to examine it, it surged through his meridians reaching every part of his body. He felt his body undergoing a strange transformation. Black smoke seeped out of his body as all the built up impurities were forced out of his pores at the same time that his meridians were being forced open by the Nirvana Phoenix Flame.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After a few seconds, he felt how his body was now able to absorb more essence of the heavens and the earth than it had ever done before. All these changes happened quickly, and they caused his Qi, within his lower dantian, and his spiritual energy, within his middle dantian, to be purified many times over.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The heat also entered every single cell of his body and strengthened his flesh and blood.</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Lei was busy undergoing a transformation, Hui Yue slumped back into his chair and sat down, heaving a heavy sigh. Every time he used the Nirvana Phoenix Flame all his energy would be used up, and he would need to restore it. Still, he felt that it was worth it to help his younger brother.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Father!&quot; &quot;Yue!&quot; &quot;Master!&quot; Various calls could be heard outside the door, and soon after it was opened. Hui Yue&#x2019;s friends appeared within the room, and their eyes were filled with vigilance as they looked around in confusion.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We felt an intense aura just now.&quot; The bull explained as he looked around. Seeing that nothing was amiss, his eyes finally fell on the younger man in the room. Seeing this person, he relaxed.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Ah, this must be your younger brother?&quot; He asked, and Hui Yue nodded his head with a smile on his face. &quot;I needed to help him with his foundation. Over the next few days, I will take one person a day and refine their bodies with the Nirvana Phoenix Flame. After that, we will find a place to hold the formation and then we will continue with the merge and the advance to a Crowned Sovereign,&quot; Hui Yue gave his orders swiftly, and everyone nodded their heads. His friends were filled with excitement as they heard Hui Yue&apos;s words. They too wished to have their body refined as they knew that the more powerful their bodies were, the more powerful a God they would become.</p><p dir="ltr">Frowning, Deng Wu looked at Hui Yue. &quot;We never really did anything for Cai Jie&apos;s body... Will this affect his future?&quot; He asked worriedly. Cai Jie was a proud person, and he was focused solely on increasing his strength. If they could have helped him and didn&#x2019;t, wasn&#x2019;t this a big mistake?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing Deng Wu, the Gods and Hui Yue smiled. &quot;Don&apos;t worry about him; his body cannot be perfected more than it already is.&quot; Hui Yue sighed in praise. &quot;He used to be a God, so his body was already created from Ancestral Worldpower. After he got severely wounded, his soul could no longer hold together a body made of energy; therefore, he had to create a body from clay and move his soul into it. Although his soul was injured, it has already been remade with Ancestral Worldpower. This is the reason his body is much more sturdy. One could say he is more like one of the Laws than a human.&quot; Hui Yue said happily.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Wait.&quot; This time Wang Ju Long interrupted him. &quot;You said he created a body from clay but how could he do this? Isn&#x2019;t it only high ranked experts who are able to create bodies from clay or soil?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue just smiled and nodded his head. &quot;Well, he could obviously do that because Cai Jie used to be an Immortal of Creation!&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
