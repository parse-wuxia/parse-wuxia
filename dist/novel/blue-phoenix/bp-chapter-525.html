Some were carrying swords while others were equipped with staves. Some were eager to start the slaughter while others were somewhat hesitant.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Of the guests at the banquet, there were those who were filled with panic and instantly threw themselves at the guards. Their attacks rained down on the guards, but these experts were few in numbers and were quickly slain.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was one of the people in the group of experts that were biding their time. He was just standing still and watching the fights that had broken out across the banquet hall. All of them were looking for a way out of the hall, but the entire room had indeed been sealed with a spacelock formation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, looking at this formation, could feel the memory within him stirring. It was clear that if he had the memories, his control over space would be greater than this spacelock formation, unfortunately, the memory was not willing to work with him, and Hui Yue had to solely rely on his own ability to survive this ordeal.</p><p dir="ltr">Within this spacelock formation, it was completely impossible for anyone to fly using their Ancestral Worldpower but a sudden thought arrived in Hui Yue&apos;s mind. He might not be able to fly like any other God could fly, but this did not mean that he was incapable of flying.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Ancestral Worldpower surged into his core where the many caves leading to his memories resided, and the Ancestral Worldpower surged into the cave where the angelic wings were placed.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as he activated them, a golden light shone around Hui Yue causing the entire area to be bathed in a celestial air. Suddenly, everyone stopped fighting, and even the City Lord who was standing at the balcony was shocked when he saw the golden light which cloaked itself around Hui Yue&apos;s body. This golden light then concentrated itself at his back where the most beautiful wings sprouted from his shoulders.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These golden wings were larger than Hui Yue himself, and with a simple flap, Hui Yue took to the ceiling, looking down on the chaos that was left behind.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The City Lord, seeing Hui Yue flying into the air with a set of golden wings turned pale.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t tell me that there was a mistake in our information. He should be a magical beast that was transformed into a human at the moment. But those wings belong to the Celestial Sword Sect. If they ever found out that I killed one of their disciples I&#x2019;m done for. Although I am the City Lord of Skydragon Fortress, even Yanluo has to acknowledge the Celestial Sword Sect. Replacing a single City Lord is not difficult at all for them.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The City Lord was growing frantic as he looked down on the many people that were fighting for their lives and seeing Hui Yue who was hanging in the air, looking down at everyone with an apathetic look in his eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">As if he sensed that the City Lord was looking at him, Hui Yue turned to look at the City Lord before a menacing grin appeared on his lips. It was clear that if Hui Yue was not killed today, the one who would suffer for it was without a doubt the City Lord. One should never let a tiger return to the forest, and the City Lord, although scared by this new revelation, knew that it was too late to change anything now. He had to carry out his plan and thoroughly execute anyone in the hall, apart from the guards.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">But Hui Yue was going to be a problem in more than one way. If he could escape, then that would give the City Lord a major headache, but there was also the issue of the black nine-tailed fox which had gone missing. It had comprehended at least one major dao, and thus it was a great threat to even the City Lord himself.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Why on earth did I want to kill him,&quot; the City Lord cursed at himself. &quot;Yes, he was too strong and could prove to be a real threat in the trials. The information I got was that he was a lone wanderer and only companions with that d*mned fox of his. There was nothing about him being from a powerful sect! Almost every expert from such a sect is well known, how could they make such a mistake?!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Although the City Lord was only mumbling to himself, Hui Yue heard every single word, and a strange smile appeared on his lips. It seemed that in his previous life he was a part of a powerful sect. This was certainly something he had never expected. Still, he was unaware of how strong this past self of his was, as the only thing he could control now were these wings which did not seem to be a sign of strength as much as an innate talent of the sect. It could easily be possible that this memory was actually a weak expert since no other attacks had revealed themselves. But even so, if the wings could be used to frighten people, then it was something at least.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;City Lord of Skydragon Fortress!&quot; Hui Yue suddenly called out with a loud voice as he saw how one expert after another was being killed on the floor below him, &quot;You wish to kill me, but I fear you do not have the capability to do so! You saw me use the dao of space against the dragon and you still think this meager spacelock formation can keep me here?&quot; Having asked, laughter erupted from Hui Yue as he shook his head. &quot;Remember, I will be back for revenge one day!&quot; He said as he suddenly vanished into thin air.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not use the dao of space. He would have if he could, but it was simply impossible for him as the memory was not willing to help him in the slightest. Instead, he made it sound as if he were using the dao of space when he, in fact, retreated into the Universe Box. Although the Spacelock formation was not something too complicated, it was definitely far above Hui Yue&apos;s current ability to deal with. Therefore, he had no other choice than to flee into the Universe Box.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside, in the banquet hall, the City Lord&apos;s face was as pale as a sheet of paper, and his teeth were clenched hard. His expression was dark as he understood that although he had set up a spacelock formation, he had utterly failed to kill the most dangerous expert in the hall.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only was he fearful of Hui Yue&apos;s personal strength but more than that, he was terrified of the fact that he might actually be from the Celestial Sword Sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Celestial Sword Sect was not like most sects because they did not invite outsiders to join them. Every member of the sect had been born into the sect, and they all had the ancient bloodline of the golden roc in their veins. Although they had the bloodline of the golden roc, all of them were humans and not beasts, and for this reason, many called them angels.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Celestial Sword Sect had existed for eons already, and over time it had become stronger and stronger. Although they did not accept outsiders from time to time extremely talented women would be accepted as brides to ensure that the bloodline did not become destroyed from incest, but even so, their bloodline had not diluted throughout the years, and the sect had grown in power as the years had gone by. By now they were very powerful, and it was a sect that none would go up against if they could avoid it.</p><p dir="ltr">Thinking this, the City Lord felt very uncomfortable. &quot;So what if his dao of space is exceptionally good,&quot; he mumbled to himself. &quot;Although he is strong and can use the dao of space to escape, he has to return to Skydragon Fortress at some point. I will make my guards look for both him and that stupid fox and then I will finish the job I started. What will happen will happen, I already insulted him, so I have no other option than to finish what I started.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Everyone!&quot; He called out, and the guards within the room all attentively stood with straight backs as they listened for the City Lord&apos;s commands. They had all sworn to assist the City Lord for a specific amount of years, and within these years they could not go against him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I need you all to keep your eyes out and capture that black nine-tailed fox who fought against the dragon. Alongside her, you also need to find the white-haired young man who has some control over space. Both of them are to be killed on sight!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The order was direct, but the City Lord dared not hesitate. He needed to get rid of this variable as soon as absolutely possible, and he kept kicking himself about the fact that he had invited Hui Yue to the banquet in the first place. At the start, he was worried about whether or not it would be a good idea, but in the end, his greed had won out.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will become the new Judge of Hell!&quot; He said to himself as he looked into the ceiling where Hui Yue had vanished in the hope of actually seeing where he had gone.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Inside the Universe Box, Hui Yue sighed heavily. He was not too keen on the fact that he had been forced to use the defensive aspect of the Universe Box, but he understood that he had no option this time.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I wonder how long I should hide here,&quot; he mumbled to himself, but instead of making a guess, he just shook his head and started traveling towards the distant Divine Beast World instead.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As he traveled through the space of the Universe Box, he felt as though he was able to comprehend something he had vaguely sensed before. It was a sensation that he had felt when he merged with the memories of the black figure with the white specks of light, the memories that had shared some time with Huli.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The sensation he felt was clearly the dao of space, and as he was wandering the vast space in the Universe Box, he started to comprehend the bare basics of space. He understood how it was everywhere around him. How it, when traveled through, was a little like water, but at the same time different. The feeling of treading through something heavy but also something as light as air. The dao of space was very contradictory which is what made it difficult to gain insights into the profound dao.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While Hui Yue was moving, he allowed for his body to feel the currents of energy that rushed towards him. The entire space was filled with dense Ancestral Worldpower, and when opening up every vein in his body, Hui Yue was able to devour a great deal of energy while moving through this dense energy field.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who traveled through the universe would move in a space shuttle like the one that he had used previously. These shuttles would absorb the Ancestral Worldpower and transform it into fuel making it possible to move through the dense energy swiftly. If one chose to fly or move on their own, there was a limit to how much of the energy one could absorb, and thus the speed would be much slower.</p><p dir="ltr">Right now Hui Yue was moving on his own without the space shuttle, but his speed was equal to if he had been on board one. He had opened up a black hole within his body which devoured all the Ancestral Worldpower in his surroundings.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue took a full day before he reached the Divine Beast World and during this trip, he had been able to sense the dao of space around him. This was, however, only the very basics of the dao, and he had a very long way to go before he would be able to comprehend enough to use it in combat.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
