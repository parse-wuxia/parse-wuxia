He had been there quite a few times already and was now rather familiar with the layout of the sect&#x2019;s main hall that was carved into the mountainside. Walking inside, he headed straight for the main hall where he knew the elders were waiting.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When he arrived, Hui Yue was stunned. He was expecting to see a few elders of the sect, but what met him was not just elders, there was also the sect leader, some dao protectors, the ancestors, and the patriarch.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was incredibly rare for dao protectors to come out from their secluded meditations, and when they did, they would usually travel the galaxy and hone their skills. Dao protectors were the true power behind the Celestial Sword Sect. It was these experts who focused on nothing but cultivating and honing their skills that were the sect&#x2019;s last line of defense in times of need.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The sect leader was not able to command these dao protectors; only the patriarch could do so, so for them to show up, he knew that a major event had occurred and it was not something insignificant as he had first assumed.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Yue at your service,&quot; Hui Yue introduced himself with a slight bow as he saw the many supreme experts in front of him, and everyone nodded in return. Only the patriarch and the ancestors were of an earlier generation, so everyone, even the most stubborn dao protectors, treated Hui Yue with respect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is good that you could come,&quot; the one who spoke was not the sect leader but the patriarch. The sect leader dealt with the everyday affairs of the sect. He would make the daily, mundane decisions and tasks that needed to be made to ensure that the sect functioned normally, but when the matter was serious, then he would go to the patriarch for assistance.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was impossible for the sect leader to order the ancestors and the dao protectors around, as these two groups only moved on the patriarch&apos;s orders, but they could be requested by the sect leader to lend a hand in certain circumstances.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had never had much to do with the sect leader of the Celestial Sword Sect before. He had either dealt with the patriarch or the ancestors directly.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Today all the elders that were in the sect had met up in the main hall, and it was an astonishing sight to see so many supreme experts gathered in one location. Even Hui Yue who was not easily intimidated felt pressure unlike ever before as he looked at the many experts in front of him. Although he was so close to comprehending a major dao, so close to becoming an Immortal of Creation, he could still be easily killed by any of the experts in front of him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I take it you are surprised that so many people have gathered here to speak with you?&quot; The patriarch asked with a smile on his face as he noticed Hui Yue&apos;s confused expression.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Nodding his head, Hui Yue said nothing. He expected that the elders wanted to give him a new mission, or that he had to assist someone with something, but now he understood that there was something completely wrong to have caused this.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Right now in the City of Endless Clouds around the pagoda is a delegation that has been sent from Diyu,&quot; the patriarch went straight to the subject at hand, smiling at Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;They refuse to tell us what they are doing here. They only want to speak with you saying that the matter is confidential. They demand that you return to Youdu with them instantly.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The reason we all have met up here is to discuss whether or not you should go with them,&quot; the patriarch continued. &quot;Since they will not tell us what this matter is about we are hesitant to let you leave. While it is obvious that it has to do with your position as the new Judge of Hell and it is true that we are not entitled to know about what happens in Diyu, we cannot help but feel that you might be in danger if you leave.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although I say this, I am not going to hold you back if you wish to follow them and go to Diyu. Do you perhaps have any idea what they want with you?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was silent for some time as he ruminated through his memories, unsure of what might have caused them to send people to pick him up. Yet no matter how much he thought about it, he could not think of anything specific.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking his head, he looked at the elders and shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said apologetically.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The patriarch and the others nodded their heads. It was clear that he had no clue, and since he had no idea, then they had none either.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Since it is like this, we will let you decide on your own what you want to do,&quot; the patriarch said what was going to happen just like that, not asking anyone for suggestions or ideas.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The elders started clamoring as some of them felt that it was too risky. What if Diyu wished to harm their genius?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was now undenied that Hui Yue was the most talented genius in the sect&apos;s history. His speed at comprehending the daos had never before been seen, and his knowledge of formations, alchemy, and inscriptions that was increasing daily was just as valuable.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Those who had wanted to get rid of him now all thought of him as a valued sect member and someone who had to be developed for the sect&#x2019;s future growth. Even the patriarch had praised him for his talent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">If he were to die prematurely, then that would be a very great loss for the sect. Although it was like this, the patriarch had still allowed for Hui Yue to decide what he wanted to do.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even Hui Yue was quite surprised by this, so he scratched his chin tentatively.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;We are both pretty close to becoming Immortals of Creation,&apos; Lan Feng&apos;s voice suddenly sounded in Hui Yue&apos;s mind. &apos;I don&apos;t think that Diyu and Yanluo would do anything to us, so in my opinion, we should leave. We rarely leave the Celestial Sword Sect and when we do it is for some banquet or event. Doing this seems much more interesting.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head. What Lan Feng said made perfect sense. Staying within the confinements of the Celestial Sword Sect was not going to help him achieve the final push he needed to become an Immortal of Creation anytime soon so he might as well see if he could stimulate himself by taking a trip to Diyu.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I would like to go to Youdu,&quot; Hui Yue said finally as he looked at the many people in front of him. Although he understood that there was a certain amount of danger involved, he did not back down, instead, he decided to face it head on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I do ask for permission to bring my companions with me. They are currently training in the various guardian sects, but I would be assured knowing that I have many whom I can trust with me.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sounds like a good idea,&quot; the patriarch nodded his head. &quot;You can bring whomever you wish to bring from the guardian sects, and I assume you will also be bringing your two fiances and the adopted children and your younger brother? If you don&apos;t take them with you, they might be bullied here in the sect; they are, after all, not direct descendants.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The patriarch was aware that these people had been welcomed with open arms due to Hui Yue&apos;s performance and talent, but if there was a chance that he was going to do something dangerous, it was likely that the ones who had previously been friendly would turn hostile. If something happened to Hui Yue, it was even more likely that they would be shunned by everyone because of their blood.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This often happened to the wives who lost their husbands on missions, but it was not as bad if they had children who were direct descendant with the bloodline of the great roc.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head, &quot;I will be taking them with me.&quot; He said as if it was the most natural thing in the world. For Hui Yue, it was indeed natural.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They had been new Gods when they had first joined the sect, but now they were all proper Primordial Immortals. They had comprehended quite a few daos, and their combat ability was no lower than someone who had just broken through to become an Immortal of Creation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Jo specialized in the dao of darkness, and her most powerful daos being the dao of destruction and the dao of oblivion.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The dao of destruction was an incredibly powerful dao that could destroy almost anything through sheer force. There was nothing elegant about it; it was crude and utilized sheer power.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The dao of oblivion was trickier, it had many different uses, but Jo mainly used it to either blind her enemies or when cultivating. She would blind them making them unaware of what had happened to them then she attacked with her other daos. When cultivating, she would use the dao to ensure that nothing around her would interrupt her.</p><p dir="ltr">Lao was like water. He focused on the minor daos under the dao of water and was rather talented. All his daos were strong, but they were mainly defensive oriented. He had decided to dedicate his life to becoming Hui Yue&apos;s shield, and thus, he focused on defense.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His most used daos were the dao of the torrential rain which was used to call forth all the water from the surroundings to make it rain. This dao strengthened all his other water daos. The dao of whirlpool and the dao of waves were the water daos with the strongest defenses.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Lei was a brilliant cultivator and focused on the dao of light. His strongest was the dao of sunshine which he could bend to his will. He could make it sharp like a blade or make it soft as light. He controlled a wide array of lights, and he could use it as attacks or to heal injuries. The light was gentle and calm, and it was a complete contrast to Jo which was the cause of much amusement.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Huli had already comprehended a major dao, but this did not mean that she would waste her time. Instead, she cultivated as hard as she could and was doing her best to comprehend the minor daos of fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Being the fox she was, fire and wind were the two elements she had the most affinity towards, and she would do all she could to increase her strength so that Hui Yue could rely on her more.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sha Yun was also doing everything in her power to improve her strength. She had long since understood that the sect looked down on her because she was not as outstanding as Huli. Although she felt pressured, she was never one to give in. Instead, she fought hard and spent all her time cultivating the dao of earth.</p><p dir="ltr">Together with the many beast Gods, the Gods that Hui Yue had met in the grave of the unknown, and his friends he was finally feeling quite safe about traveling. He had a great many friends, and they would be able to hold their own against the majority of the problems they might encounter on their way.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Since this is so important, I will send Pei Ziqi with you as well,&quot; the patriarch said again, interrupting Hui Yue&apos;s train of thoughts. &quot;She has followed you before, and although she is a dao protector now, she can help you out with your endeavors.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I know you intend to search for something when you become an Immortal of Creation, so you hereby have my permission to travel the galaxy if you become an Immortal of Creation before returning to the sect.&quot;</p><br></div><p></p>
