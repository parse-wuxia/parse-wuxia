It had started with the smaller sects and families who controlled the weaker Heavenly Worlds.</p><p>Hui Yue heard about these skirmishes quite quickly as he had regularly been trying to get information about the Blood Demons from the intelligence gathering branch of the sect, and he frowned as he walked away with the news.</p><p>It was as if many of the experts in the Heavenly Worlds suddenly, at the same time, decided to fight against their opponents, and the ones instigating the attacks all had powerful forces hidden nearby to step in at the right time and cripple their enemy.</p><p>Hui Yue had requested all information he could get about these skirmishes and was surprised to find that every faction which was waging war had been changed within the last ten thousand years. All these various factions were now led by a demon.</p><p>Some of these demons were known to be Blood Demons, but others were not. Still, Hui Yue was not stupid, and he instantly knew that something was starting to happen.</p><p>The first person he contacted was not his father, nor was it the patriarch, instead he headed straight home and took up the communication orb.</p><p>&quot;Yanluo?&quot; He asked as he contacted the King of Hell. Yanluo&apos;s face appeared in the orb, and he looked a little bewildered about why Hui Yue would contact him.</p><p>&quot;I am sure you have heard about the fights that are breaking out through the minor sects and families all over?&quot; Hui Yue asked nervously, and Yanluo nodded his head. He knew about it, but his face showed no traces of care. It was nothing to him that the minor sects and families were causing problems.</p><p>&quot;Well, the problem is not their disturbances...&quot; Hui Yue sighed, &quot;but I have been keeping an eye on the Blood Demons because of An He, and it seems that the faction behind all these fights is, in fact, the demons.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Some of them are known Blood Demons while others are not, but you tell me if they are not blood demons, then what are they?&quot;</p><p>Yanluo, who had been quite casual at the start of their conversation, slowly became more and more serious. He was used to fighting the major sects, and he was used to butting heads with the Blood Demons, but he was not used to caring about the minor sects and families. Thus he had not paid it any attention.</p><p>&quot;They must have some plan,&quot; Yanluo mumbled in deep thought, and Hui Yue nodded his head. He was also worried about what their plans might be.</p><p>&quot;The Blood Demons are cunning. They will do anything to kick us out of Diyu, and when Diyu has been replaced, they will start building their empire with the Blood Demons and demons as the leading, superior race.&quot;</p><p>Yanluo was in deep thought as he spoke about the ultimate goals of the Blood Demons, and he cocked his head to the side and closed his eyes for a moment.</p><p>&quot;They would not do anything without a purpose. They have been preparing for many many eons already and to think that they have finally begun to fight back... I fear that war is on the horizon.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue felt a little worried when he heard what Yanluo said, but at the same time he clenched his fists and furrowed his brow. He was unable to see what they wished to gain from causing disorder in the lower ranks of the galaxy.</p><p>&quot;We will have to call a meeting,&quot; Yanluo sighed. &quot;The Blood Demons are a threat to all factions that are in power right now, and I fear that we need to stand together if we wish to fight them in the future.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These demons are very good at hiding their power. They have been hidden underground in various worlds for the last many eons. No one knows exactly where they are or what they do. Some would even have thought they were a legend, were it not for the few Blood Demons appearing every thousand years like crusaders, showing their allegiance to their cause.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Even I do not know too much about them,&quot; Yanluo continued to complain. &quot;My master knows about them but refuses to tell me anything. He just tells me that someday I will know what is going on and that it is impossible for me to change the path that history is walking down.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. There were things which could not be changed, and it was obvious that since they had spent eons preparing, this fight was inevitable. Hui Yue was just surprised that they had started to carry out their plans so soon.</p><p>&quot;It&#x2019;s not all bad,&quot; Yanluo said with a smile. &quot;You might be able to deal with An He easier this way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;An He is treated like a prince by the Blood Demons. He has been taking one pill after another to boost his potential and make himself stronger and stronger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Usually he would be heavily guarded and not leave their headquarters, but now things are different. Since they will be starting a war in the near future, they will need to send out all their pawns. Although he is treated like a prince, he is after all only useful if he can do well on the battlefield.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. What Yanluo said made perfect sense, and although he was worried about the situation, he could not help but smile slightly.</p><p>After finishing his talk with Yanluo, Hui Yue made a round in the sect to visit certain people. The first person he met up with was his father to tell him what he had found, and the second person was the patriarch.</p><p>After them he sought out Sha Yun, Huli, and Wang Ju Long. Ever since the wedding these three had been working harder than anyone else in the Celestial Sword Sect. They took missions in the sect to save up contribution points, and they used resources as freely as mortals drank water and wine.</p><p>Finding them was always a problem. After the wedding, Hui Yue had found out that the sect, did, in fact, have special places that were used for training in a certain dao, and Huli was usually found in the area where the dao of darkness was the densest.</p><p>She had already comprehended the major dao of wind, but she had long since given up on sensing the other daos. Now, however, she was in an environment that allowed for her to sense other daos and she cultivated with a relentlessness and fierceness that was befitting a beast.</p><p>Wang Ju Long was also mostly found in this area as well. After having her soul submerged in darkness for as long as she had, she found that she had an innate talent for this dao. Sometimes she would mention that she could feel something else behind the dao of darkness, a dao dealing with death.</p><p>Every time Hui Yue heard about this, he could not help but shiver. It seemed that the Alchemist God had been correct. Of all of them, the first person to comprehend a heavenly dao was likely to be Wang Ju Long. She now had a natural connection with the dao of death, and thus, she could sense it even before she had comprehended a major dao.</p><p>Because the two of them were together, Hui Yue went straight for the area where the dao of darkness was present. It was a small valley where no light ever reached.</p><p>Apart from the darkness, there was also a gloomy atmosphere, and long shadows were thrown everywhere.</p><p>Hui Yue quickly located Wang Ju Long and Huli and told them to follow him. Neither asked any questions; they just stood up, ignored what they were doing, and followed him as they went towards the area where the major dao of earth was the most prominent.</p><p>Sha Yun was very close to comprehending the major dao of the earth, and thus she spent the majority of her time on the ground where she could comprehend the dao.</p><p>After picking up Sha Yun, Hui Yue returned to the valley where he and his family lived. Lao, Jo, and Lei were currently in the valley cultivating on their own.</p><p>They were still new Gods and only had a small amount of Ancestral Worldpower. The valley they were in was filled with Ancestral Worldpower, and they spent their time greedily absorbing it.</p><p>&quot;Come with me,&quot; was all Hui Yue said as he gathered every one of his friends and headed towards the City of Endless Clouds.</p><p>Everyone was puzzled, but no one asked what was going on. On the way, Hui Yue had taken the communication orb and summoned everyone who was present in the city. This included Little Dragon, Deng Wu, Wei, Lan Feng, Xiao She, and Rong Xing.</p><p>These six people were the ones who had not been a part of a guardian sect before, and they were cultivating on their own in the city.</p><p>Hui Yue ordered them to rush towards a specific restaurant and ensure that they could get a private room. He had something important to talk with them about.</p><p>After asking them to make the reservation, he also contacted everyone from the guardian sects and ordered them to come as soon as possible towards the City of Endless Clouds.</p><p>The one that would take the longest time to arrive would be Cai Jie, as he was the furthest away, but even he understood that something was happening, so he left everything he was busy doing and headed out right away.</p><p>Arriving at the restaurant a servant was standing at the door. They all knew Hui Yue and recognized him, and the servant bowed deeply before leading Hui Yue, his friends, and family towards the room where the others were waiting for them.</p><p>As they entered the room, all eyes landed on Hui Yue. He had not said anything about what was happening, and his request for the meeting had been very sudden. Even more astonishing was it that he had summoned all his friends.</p><p>As the door closed behind them, Hui Yue took his seat at the end of the table and looked at all of them before his eyes landed on Lan Feng.</p><p>Of everyone present, the one who was the most serious was Lan Feng because he had felt Hui Yue&apos;s emotions and knew his feelings of urgency.</p><p>&quot;An He is up to something,&quot; Hui Yue said seriously and solemnly to everyone present causing many of them to frown.</p><p>&quot;As you know, small skirmishes have broken out all over the galaxy, and the ones behind them are in fact the Blood Demons. I spoke with Yanluo about it, and he is sure that war is coming. A war between the Blood Demons and the rest of the galaxy, but even if they are strong they cannot face us all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It is clear that they have some plan that will make it possible for them to fight all of us, but even if they don&apos;t, is it really possible for the galaxy to come together against them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a great thing for us though. An He, who usually is hard to reach and even harder to harm will be on the front lines according to Yanluo.&quot; Hui Yue continued as a smile appeared on his lips.</p><p>&quot;If he is on the front lines, then we will run headlong into the danger and kill him!. We will seek out the Blood Demons and fight them head on!&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have not had a lot of time on our own back here in the Celestial Sword Sect, but it seems like we are going to set out again soon. It seems that we will in the near future be fighting the Blood Demons head-on to find An He and get rid of the biggest threat to our lives and our home!&quot;</p><p></p></div><p></p>
