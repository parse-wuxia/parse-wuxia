Huli and Sha Yun were the first to be found. They were deep within enemy lines, battling in their beast forms in a frenzied bloodlust. They killing one Blood Demon after another as easy as chickens.</p><p>They then found the red-eyed Xiao Ning and Ye Ling. Neither Luo Qiang nor Zhu Jun were with them, and although they said nothing, Hui Yue understood that those two had not made it.</p><p>The next group to be found was a group of the beast Gods before they found the Rong twins and Deng Wu.</p><p>Then they found Wan Qiao, Su Xiaoyun, Xiao She, and Lan Feng followed by even more of the beast gods.</p><p>Finally, they found Lao, Jo, Lei, and Pei Ziqi who were with Wei.</p><p>Their group was smaller now than it had been before, but none of them had time to mourn their losses right now.</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s eyes scanned the battlefield, and he was surprised to see that the human half-step Overlords had already defeated the Manor Lords that they had been fighting and they had all gone to assist Yama.</p><p>Although Yama had the aid of three half-step Overlords, the Blood Demon Overlord was still not easy to deal with. He evaded and parried most attacks, ensuring that no one was able to cause any damage to him.</p><p>Although he was outnumbered, he was not even out of breath. His every move flowed as gracefully as water, and he used the minimal amount of energy to deal with all the attacks that came his way.</p><p>Seeing this, Hui Yue knew that he had to do something. &quot;We are but a mosquito fighting against the Overlord, but even mosquitos can be an annoyance. Maybe we can bring him out of his tranquil state of mind.&quot; Lan Feng was very honest about it and nodded his head. &quot;If you are going, then I will go too. If one perishes, the other of us only has a slim chance of survival. I would rather risk my life fighting for humanity.&quot;</p><p>Lan Feng looked at Xiao She who nodded her head. She was simply too weak to go up there, if she tried she would easily be killed by the shockwaves. She wouldn&#x2019;t be able to accomplish anything, so she was forced to stay further down and fight the regular demons.</p><p>Huli and Sha Yun looked antsy; they were uncomfortable about what Hui Yue wanted to do, but they did not stop him. Instead, they steeled their resolve and nodded their heads. They knew that if the Blood Demons ended up winning this war, and Hui Yue had not gone, then he would blame himself as all the people he held dear would lose their lives.</p><p>Since this was the case, no one tried to stop him. He and Lan Feng sighed and nodded their heads. At this moment thought Hui Yue felt a small, slim hand on his own.</p><p>&quot;If you are going, then I am going too.&quot; Wang Ju Long said with a face that did not accept discussion. &quot;I died once before, and even if I die again, it will not be too bad. I have had a great life, and I have no regrets. If you have to risk your life, let me risk mine by your side, and if needed, we can head to the yellow river together!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue, Lan Feng, and Wang Ju Long rose towards the upper skies where the most serious battle was unfolding.</p><p>Hui Yue attacked the Overlord with his swordlight. It was infused with his two heavenly daos and all the strength that the Celestial Sword could muster, but no matter how much he tried, the attacks did not even leave a mark on the Blood Demon&apos;s body.</p><p>Hui Yue expected that he would be incapable of truly injuring an Overlord, but he did not expect that he would not even be able to leave a mark when using his daos and the Celestial Sword to their limits.</p><p>&quot;We could try the merged Phoenix Descent again?&quot; Lan Feng asked tentatively, but Hui Yue shook his head.</p><p>&quot;The rebound is doomed to kill us,&quot; he said. So far they had almost destroyed their bodies using their strong attack the Phoenix Descent against the half-step Overlord, but if they were trying to do something against a genuine Overlord, then it was obvious that they would completely destroy their bodies.</p><p>&quot;All we can do is try to interrupt him or annoy him somehow,&quot; Hui Yue sighed. &quot;We can try using the dao of light to blind him then fly as close to him as we can get without getting killed by Yama&apos;s attacks while constantly attacking him.&quot;</p><p>Wang Ju Long and Lan Feng nodded their heads. What Hui Yue said made sense, and they instantly launched their attacks, one after another. They flew as close to the Overlord as they dared.</p><p>They no longer used their strongest attacks, but they chose the flashiest and most annoying ones.</p><p>Hui Yue used the dao of light to the limits sending out one blinding light after another that was supported by the strength of his two heavenly daos in an attempt to annoy and disturb the Overlord.</p><p>Yama&apos;s eyes shone when he saw Hui Yue and the others gamble their lives to help him. At first, he thought that they would try using their deadliest attacks, but after a bit of time, he understood their aim and nodded his head satisfied.</p><p>Although he knew that they were close to the Overlord and could easily die from the shockwaves of even just one attack, Yama did not lessen his strength at all. He used everything he had to continue his onslaught against the Blood Demon Overlord.</p><p>Hui Yue nodded his head. They had come here for the sake of killing the Overlord or at least assisting in the task. If Yama feared for their safety, then their assistance would prove a hindrance instead.</p><p>Hui Yue, Lan Feng, and Wang Ju Long continued their attacks, and although they posed absolutely no threat to the Overlord, he was starting to get annoyed by the three small flies that were constantly attacking him.</p><p>Sighing, the Overlord swatted out with his hand, a single swat, that seemed as casual as anything else, descended onto Hui Yue and Wang Ju Long.</p><p>HuI Yue reacted faster than Wang Ju Long and pushed her away to safety. Unfortunately, he could not make it away in time and was hit by the palm strike.</p><p>He was sent flying countless kilometers away as blood oozed out of his mouth, ears, and eyes. Now his already destroyed body was trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Hui Yue was on the verge of death, but he saw that the cost of this casual attack against Hui Yue had resulted in him taking the first actual wound from Yama.</p><p>&quot;Just once more!&quot; Hui Yue said through gritted teeth as he swallowed some pills to stabilize his body and soul.</p><p>&quot;I have one attack that should be able to interrupt him. It won&apos;t damage him, and it is slightly weak, but it is definitely a spectacle to see. Let me use my final attack and shock him enough for Yama to seriously wound him.&quot;</p><p>Having decided to bet his life on it, Hui Yue sighed and shook his head. He felt nostalgic and remembered every single step he had taken on the path of cultivation.</p><p>He remembered how he had died in his old world and was reborn into the Divine Beast World. He remembered how he had grown up on the outskirts of the Magical Forest and found good friends who went with him to the academy.</p><p>He remembered the fight for Riluo City and their descent into the Dungeons of the Divine. He remembered the war against the Siban Empire and his trip into the Grave of the Unknown.</p><p>He remembered how he had gained friends on each step of his journey as he slowly stepped further and further down his path of cultivation.</p><p>He remembered how he went to the red realm and challenged the trial to obtain the Formation of Life. He even remembered how he became a God and entered the vast galaxy.</p><p>Here he found a new family and a new home. Here he became a member of Diyu and the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p>He had found his master, he had found the ancient Archaic World.</p><p>He had gotten married to the women he loved more than anything, and was able to enjoy countless years together with them. In fact, although he felt like he had much to live for, he was more than willing to give up his life if it meant that they could live on.</p><p>Everything that he had experienced was more than he had ever dreamed of, and he was now willing to sacrifice his remaining years.</p><p>&quot;I hope that Feng can survive,&quot; he sighed as he glanced at Lan Feng who was still fighting against the Blood Demon Overlord.</p><p>Having said this, Hui Yue reached deep into himself and found an attack he had not used much before, but that had a lot of potential.</p><p>This was a legacy attack. An attack he had learned when he merged with the Blue Monk, the Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>Hui Yue flew towards the Overlord once more, and he activated all the energy he had within his body and felt how it grew limp. He infused it with all his Ancestral Worldpower and even tried to push in the superimposed daos.</p><p>Hui Yue, who no longer could move even the tiniest bit of his body, felt how the surrounding air was changing.</p><p>Thunder started rumbling on the horizon and the entire sky darkened.</p><p>The sky changed almost instantly and lightning started descending. Small lightning bolts struck all over the place, but massive bolts of lightning were charging themselves and shot towards the Blood Demon Overlord.</p><p>Although these lightning bolts were not the strongest type of lightning, but they were not far from it, and they shook the body of the Overlord causing him to feel surprised and frustrated. He was being attacked from every single side, and now even the heavens above were sending down lightning to disturb him.</p><p>Up in the heavens, one could see that there were three types of lightning. One was the small bolts that descended all the time, and each single descent caused a Blood Demon to perish.</p><p>Then there was the second strongest lightning bolts. These bolts charged their energy and attacked the Blood Demon Overlord causing him to be interrupted, frustrated, and left trembling from anger.</p><p>Finally there was a massive bolt of lightning charging and storing its power that Hui Yue did not know how much damage it would cause. This bolt was gathering lightning around it and constantly growing in size constantly. Hui Yue felt the hairs on his body stand on end from just looking at it and knew that if it landed on even a half-step Overlord, then that expert would vanish with not even ashes remaining.</p><p>Still, he had no energy to consider this. His body had used all the energy he had dragged out from the pill, and the body was now cracking. Chunks of flesh were falling off his body, and he could feel that it was crumbling like a stone that had been smashed by a hammer. There was simply no chance to save his body any longer.</p><p>Having reached this conclusion, Hui Yue understood that there was no other end than his death. He could not leave his body as his soul was too exhausted, and when his body could no longer hold on, both soul and body would perish.</p><p>That was when Hui Yue saw that the massive bolt of lightning that had gathered strength for quite some time finally began its descent. His eyes widened in shock when he saw that it did not head for the Blood Demon Overlord, but him!</p><p>&quot;I guess it will be a fast, painless death then,&quot; Hui Yue sighed.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
