The bisected dummy started to repair itself, and moments after, the glow vanished and it looked as if nothing had ever happened to it.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Amusing,&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself as he summoned forth another ten wind blades and chopped the dummy into even smaller pieces.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although it was now spread all over the floor, the same thing happened once more. The strange light shone, and the broken dummy mended itself once again.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having broken the dummy twice, it was easy to guess that it would mend itself again if he were to slice it into even smaller bits, but he could not help but be curious. Would it also be able to mend itself if it was crushed into smithereens.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue used his dao of gravity which put a thousand fold pressure on the dummy, but even when he did this, it was not enough to crush it. All that happened was that it snapped and started digging into the ground under the immense pressure.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue paused for a moment and released the pressure exerted by his gravitation field before he saw the light shine and the dummy repair itself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Up until now, Hui Yue had been quite a bit away from the dummy, but now that he was curious about it, he moved closer to inspect it. It seemed like any other metal dummy, completely simple and not as marvelous as its regenerative abilities would suggest. Constantly repairing itself must take quite a bit of energy, and Hui Yue had no idea how it was capable of doing such a thing.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Although you have just become a God, I figured you would be smarter,&apos; Lan Feng&apos;s voice suddenly mocked in Hui Yue&apos;s mind, and the young man instantly stopped to hear what the bird&#x2019;s explanation was.</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;When you were a mortal cultivator, you studied some inscriptions, and you know that Deng Wu deals with inscriptions too. It should be obvious that there are Gods who specialize in inscriptions, and theirs are many times more profound than the ones you knew as a mortal.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;Apart from inscriptions, there are also formations. They are specialists in their field just like alchemists are. I am surprised you did not see them when looking around earlier. Perhaps they just did not catch your attention, but now that you are a God, inscriptions and formations will be much stronger than any you have seen before.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;I bet that there are countless formations around this world set to protect it should any enemy&#x2019;s invade. I also think there is a formation that makes it so only those with the bloodline of the great roc are capable of entering the inner sect&apos;s area.&apos;</p><p dir="ltr">&apos;I see,&apos; Hui Yue mumbled to himself, and suddenly, a brilliant smile appeared on his lips as he fully understood what Lan Feng said. He had a slight understanding of inscriptions and formations, and he wished to deepen this understanding, but at the same time, he also understood that it should only be something he did in his spare time. He could not afford to delay his cultivation because of it. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was still standing in front of the dummy, but his thoughts were far away. He was chatting with Lan Feng about cultivation, inscriptions, alchemy, and formations.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Are you just going to stand and look at the training dummy or are you going to attack and practice your dao?&quot; A fairly sour voice sounded from behind Hui Yue who was dragged from his thoughts. He turned around only to find that there was a whole group of experts staring at him.</p><p dir="ltr">The one who had spoken out was a young woman who seemed rather annoyed. Her hands were resting on her hips, and her expression said that she was looking for a fight. Despite this, Hui Yue just observed her with no change to his expressions before he flashed a friendly smile to her. He then turned around to leave, &quot;sorry.&quot; He said with an upbeat voice, &quot;I was thinking about something and must have lost track of time; please go on ahead.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The already sour expression on the face of the woman turned even darker when she heard his reply. Her words had been rude and rough, they were practically begging for Hui Yue to fight her, or at the least, he should have been greatly insulted, yet this seemed to not be the case.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Those who were just normal cultivators saw this and started to looking down on Hui Yue instantly. One should never apologize if they had strength, but those with a bit higher intellect instantly understood that Hui Yue was just avoiding the challenge. He was not willing to show off his full strength yet.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Coward!&quot; The girl yelled out, her face livid but Hui Yue just completely ignored her as she kept moving until he sensed her attack and dodged to the side.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment he dodged, he noticed a windblade shoot past where he had just been standing. The windblade was not small, and it was full of killing intent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue was a kind person, he would be cold to those who were cold to him. If someone treated him with respect, he would treat them with respect, if someone treated him with hostility, then he would kill them as soon as he had the chance.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he thought like this, Hui Yue understood that it would be a very bad idea to kill someone within the sect, but he couldn&#x2019;t just let this woman get away with attacking him like she had.</p><p dir="ltr">His face was still blank, and no emotions showed when he turned around as he looked at the woman who had attacked. &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; He asked with a frosty voice.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The girl, who had expected to see him fly into a frenzy and return the attack, was shocked when she saw his expression and the casual way he requested an explanation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are a coward that runs away! Our Celestial Sword Sect does not need members like you!&quot; She exclaimed, but Hui Yue just shrugged his shoulders as he glanced at her.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The girl was no longer a member of the younger generation, but her strength was definitely below that of Pei Ze and Pei Feng, not to mention the youth from the Nightcrawler Sect. Thus Hui Yue looked down on her. Not only was she far weaker than him, but he had two bloodlines that could easily suppress her.</p><p dir="ltr">First was the bloodline of the roc. He was a third generation descendant, and thus his bloodline was many times stronger than hers. Secondly, he had the bloodline of the Vermilion Bird, and although it was weak, it was still the sovereign of all birds. So far he had never made use of this bloodline but to threaten this woman, he felt like it was not too much.</p><p dir="ltr">He stepped closer to the woman, and the closer he came to her the more of the bloodline of the Vermilion Bird he activated. The woman and everyone else present could feel the overwhelming pressure that Hui Yue released.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Their own bloodlines were being suppressed, and unknown fear crept into the hearts of everyone who looked at Hui Yue. They could feel the bloodline he was activating. Was this the power of a third generation bloodline? Everyone was shocked, but no one was feeling worse than the woman who had challenged him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I don&apos;t usually fight girls,&quot; Hui Yue said casually as he took another step forward and the pressure intensified. &quot;I don&apos;t see a reason to fight over something as useless as this dummy.&quot; he continued as he took another step forward.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I don&apos;t approve of sneak attacks,&quot; was said following another step. &quot;I don&apos;t care to fight weaklings.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I don&apos;t see why I should waste my time on someone like you who cannot even stand up to the pressure emitted from someone from my generation,&quot; Hui Yue finished with one more step. By now he was a mere three steps away from the woman who was sweating with a pale face, and the fear in her eyes was obvious.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She was trembling, and her entire body seemed weak. She was incapable of saying a single word. Her body refused to answer to her, and it unwillingly took a few steps backward.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, who was usually a very admirable young man was currently looking at the young woman with disgust.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t annoy people stronger than you. One day you will meet someone who is not a member of the Celestial Sword Sect, and it will be your end.&quot; Hui Yue sighed as he withdrew the bloodline of the Vermilion Bird back into his body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The moment he did everyone suddenly felt as if they could breathe again. It had just felt as if someone was holding their hearts and could squash it at any time, killing them with but a glance. They were all absolutely horrified.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was a strength that Hui Yue had and that the other strong members of the Celestial Sword Sect had compared to the other and later generations.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While some felt awe towards Hui Yue most felt jealousy. Some felt that Hui Yue was just abusing his innate bloodline to bully others, but many understood that it was not the case. Hui Yue was likely to have many tricks up his sleeve, but one of them, and the one which proved that Hui Yue was almost unbeatable within the sect was his bloodline.</p><p dir="ltr">What they did not know was that the bloodline Hui Yue had just used was that of the Vermilion Bird and that it had nothing to do with him being a third generation descendant.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even if he were up against a second generation, or even the Great Roc itself, then Hui Yue would be able to put some pressure on them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not wait for them to speak. He just snorted at the woman as he turned around and left. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The entire area was deadly silent. No one knew what they were supposed to say or do. All of them had felt the pressure, and they instantly understood that Hui Yue was someone they needed to be wary of. Even the stronger experts within the Dummy Training Field had felt this pressure, and they too had been greatly shocked.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The girl was dejected. Her heart felt like it had been ripped out and she felt her face flare red with embarrassment. She had expected that since she was as strong as Pei Ze and Pei Feng, dealing with a member of the younger generation would not prove difficult. Little did she know that this expert was many times stronger than both Pei Feng and Pei Ze.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Did he have to be so ruthless with his words?&quot; She mumbled to herself as she regretted her actions. Today she wished to use Hui Yue to gain some fame but had instead become a stepping stone for him to have his name spread all over the sect once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as she knew it would, the events of today only took moments before word of what had happened spread across the entire sect. It was said that Hui Yue&apos;s intimidating air was so frightening that everyone felt their hearts stop and their bodies tremble uncontrollably.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After finishing his tour around the inner sect, Hui Yue returned to the inner sect where he entered the Inscription Manor and the Castle of Formations. He purchased some foundational books on both subjects after which he rushed back to his father&apos;s mountain. It was time to read a little and gain a solid understanding of all the subjects that interested him. &#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
