Are they completely mad?!&quot; An He grumbled to himself as he was seated on a throne in a dimly lit room.</p><p>Apart from him, there was another person present, a servant girl. The girl dared not move, let alone answer the question that her master had thrown out.</p><p>&quot;I guess they have just sent invitations to every Crowned Sovereign in the hopes that we will all show up to give them face, but they should know that some of us would never go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Obviously I cannot join. If that little bastard decides to use his wedding to get rid of me, then I would not stand a chance of surviving.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But if I do not show up, then others will know about the enmity between myself and this annoying Hui Yue.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Still, I can always excuse myself easily. I am a demon from the Blood Demons. We have a terrible relationship with Diyu, and that little bastard can be considered a powerhouse of Diyu as well. Not showing up is just my dislike towards Diyu.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Should I send a present or not though... I don&#x2019;t want to, but even the other demons will send presents, although they won&apos;t actually show up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#x2019;s a shame we have so few demons who are capable of holding a position as a Crowned Sovereign. If there were more of us, then we would not be pushed around like this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Screw it; it is just a little bastard. I should send a present so that no one has any suspicions of our enmity. I am going to send him a present that he will loathe the most.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I still remember that I placed that stupid bird in a phoenix hairpin and considering the years he has been hidden within are quite numerous sending him a phoenix hairpin as a reminder that his freedom will be short-lived should be fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No one else will be able to understand it, but he will know what it means. So be it. Who would have thought that this child whom I decided to toy with would turn out to be such a threat to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He has not been here for long, but he is already able to make both the Celestial Sword Sect and Diyu move for him. Who knows which tricks he has hidden up his sleeve and which relationships he has created since transcending the mortal realm.&quot;</p><p>An He turned silent and leaned back in the chair, his eyes were distant. His hand caressed his chin, and his mouth was mumbling words all the time without saying anything specific.</p><p>&quot;Well, even if he is a problematic foe, he is not able to defeat me,&quot; An He finally sighed, and a smile appeared on his handsome face once more. &quot;I have already comprehended four major daos. Although it is almost impossible for me to continue to improve, my strength is now so strong that only those at the heavenly dao level can prove to be problematic to me. A simple child like that bastard cannot stand even a casual slap from me!&quot;</p><p>While An He was debating if he should send a gift, Hui Yue was feeling exhausted from greeting guest after guest.</p><p>At the start, the patriarch had been the one to greet the guests, but he soon found that everyone had come for the sake of Hui Yue and they were anything but satisfied with the patriarch.</p><p>Although Hui Yue was a genius of the younger generation, his rank was far below the patriarch, and his fame was also below the patriarch. Normally everyone would have been grateful to see the patriarch interacting with them, however, this time they had come for Hui Yue, and thus, they wished for him to be the one that met them when they arrived.</p><p>It was not only the guests that wished to see Hui Yue, but the people delivering presents also wished to hand things over directly to Hui Yue, but this was not always possible.</p><p>Because of this, Hui Yue had spent the last many days rushing from one side of the sect to the other meeting countless groups of people and introducing himself to them.</p><p>He was stunned to see the majority of the Crowned Sovereigns appear, and the only ones who did not, were the ones under the Blood Demons.</p><p>&quot;Do you think that An He will show up?&quot; Lan Feng asked Hui Yue for the umpteenth time, but Hui Yue did not get impatient. Instead, he shook his head, &quot;He would not dare meet us here. He knows who I am and he also knows that you and I are together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He will most likely use the excuse of being apart of the Blood Demons to avoid showing up in the hopes that no one questions his true reasons for staying away.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It would be much better if he did show up,&quot; Lan Feng said with a chilling edge to his voice. &quot;If he shows up and Yanluo is present, then I bet he will be able to deal with An He as easily as killing a chicken. I cannot relax before we have truly eradicated that disgusting man!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue too felt enmity towards An He, but he also understood that the enmity he felt was a joke compared to Lan Feng&#x2019;s feelings.</p><p>Having been trapped for thousands of years within the phoenix hairpin knowing that some unrespectful man had taken over the world belonging to his father just enraged Lan Feng. Although this had been terrible, it was even worse knowing that his brothers had been held captive much like himself and that he had been unable to do anything for them. All these feelings of being useless were clear in Lan Feng&apos;s memory, and he could not help but hate An He with all his heart.</p><p>&quot;Excuse me, young master Yue,&quot; a voice suddenly sounded and interrupted the conversation between Hui Yue and Lan Feng. A timid young man appeared in front of him, and when his eyes landed on him, he could see the veneration and respect almost shining forth from the young man.</p><p>&quot;There is a free cultivator who wishes to meet with you and give you a wedding present,&quot; he said with trembling voice.</p><p>Hearing this, Hui Yue frowned, but he said nothing. It was not an unusual thing for guests to request to meet Hui Yue personally but to directly interrupt him when he was busy with someone else, was new.</p><p>&quot;He says he knows you,&quot; the young man continued with a trembling voice, trying to explain why he had come and interrupted Hui Yue who was speaking with his most trusted friend.</p><p>&quot;He knows me?&quot; Hui Yue was puzzled. Who could it be that appeared out of nowhere to offer a present? The only people that Hui Yue knew were already following him closely or invited to the party.</p><p>&quot;I&#x2019;ll go meet them, come with me,&quot; he said as he looked at Lan Feng who nodded his head.</p><p>Together the three of them went to the edge of the sect where a hooded figure was waiting for them. When he saw the hooded figure in the distance, he did indeed feel a familiar aura coming from this person, but he could not say exactly who it was.</p><p>It was not until they came close enough for the person to lift the cloak that Hui Yue recognized the person and his eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>In front of him was the Frozen General. It was clear that he had not been as fortunate as Hui Yue in his endeavor to explore the great galaxy. He looked haggard and exhausted, but there was vigor in his eyes that had never been there before.</p><p>&quot;Long time no see,&quot; Zhong Fai said with a smile, and Hui Yue who looked at him also smiled back. &quot;Come inside,&quot; Hui Yue said as he spread his arms. &quot;Stay for the wedding, settle down for a bit, and relax!&quot;</p><p>Zhong Fai&apos;s eyes widened for a bit, but he quickly nodded his head. Although he was a proud person, he was also exhausted constantly trying to make a living in the outside world. To be allowed a short time of peace would be good.</p><p>&quot;I brought an important wedding present for you,&quot; he said with a solemn voice. His eyes landed on Lan Feng as he spoke.</p><p>&quot;When I was traveling the world, I came across a young man who shares a body with the Tiger kid from the Divine Beast World.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We were comrades for a short while, and I told him what I knew of the Divine Beast World.&quot; Zhong Fai was about to continue speaking, but Hui Yue stopped him.</p><p>&quot;Let us get you settled in first,&quot; he said with a smile, and he withdrew a bag from his Universe Box.</p><p>&quot;Eat some of these pills, and you will feel better. I will get some food sent to you and a maid to help you take a bath so that you can unwind. I will also get a tailor to come make a suit for you so that you will look dashing at the wedding!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue was not stingy when it came to the things he gave the Frozen General. Although they had no debts between one another, they came from the same world.</p><p>The Frozen General could have become a God long ago, but he had refused to succumb to the other God and merely lived under his reign while waiting for a way to rebel.</p><p>Anyone who refused to succumb to An He was someone Hui Yue valued highly and knowing the Frozen General, he knew he was not your average God.</p><p>Zhong Fai did not refuse the things he was given. He was a proud individual, but he was also aware that Hui Yue had no hostile thoughts towards him. This was the first chance he had to unwind since he had become a God, and he truly felt that he needed this break to not lose his sanity.</p><p>Hui Yue looked at the young man who had led them to Zhong Fai. &quot;Think you can help me out?&quot; he asked gently, and the young man instantly nodded his head. &quot;I will rush to get a place readied for your friend!&quot; he said excitedly, and Hui Yue nodded his head.</p><p>&quot;While we wait for it to be sorted, why not go to visit Yun? You and Yun can be said to be good friends. She has worried about you since you went out on your own, and that she will be able to see you again, I am sure she will be happy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am glad to hear that,&quot; Zhong Fai laughed. This was the first time he had laughed in a very long time, and he nodded his head. He too considered Sha Yun a good friend, and he would like to meet her again.</p><p>&quot;You are a lucky man able to marry three beautiful wives,&quot; Zhong Fai said with a sigh, but there was no jealousy in his voice. &quot;I never thought that Sha Yun would approve of someone else being the principal wife. She can be a little stubborn, but I am glad to see that you managed to make it all work out.&quot;</p><p>Hearing about the principal wife stuff, Hui Yue broke out with a cold sweat. He was not comfortable with the fact that his wives were split into rank, but he knew he had no choice.</p><p>Together Lan Feng, Zhong Fai, and Hui Yue made their way towards the patriarch&apos;s mountain where the three women were busy preparing their wedding.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
