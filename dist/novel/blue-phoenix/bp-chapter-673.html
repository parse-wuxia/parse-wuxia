It was neither dead nor alive, but waiting for a consciousness to enter it.</p><p>One way to do so was to just leave your previous body and enter the new one while another way was to impart one&apos;s lifeforce into it.</p><p>If one were to create a new race or a new living being, they would need to give this being the breath of life. To do so, they would have to sacrifice their own lifeforce. In this instance, though, it was not needed.</p><p>&quot;Looks good,&quot; Little Green said with a smile as she looked at the body in front of her, and without wasting any time, she willed her soul to leave her current body. The moment her soul left her body it started to dissipate into thin air. It was like watching one&apos;s breath on a cold winter day. It turned to mist and slowly vanished into nothingness.</p><p>What was left behind was the soul of Little Green. A soul which was many times more vulnerable now than it had been before. Because she was so vulnerable, she instantly descended to the body that was laying on the ground.</p><p>Hui Yue was filled with curiosity about how the whole process worked. He was a little worried that things had not gone exactly as planned, but at the same time, he also felt that he had done the best he could. He was not familiar with the process of creating bodies so he could not make a body as well as Yanluo had made his, but he still thought that this body was not too bad.</p><p>After a few moments, the fingertips of the body started twitching, the eyelids trembled, and the previously dead beauty started breathing.</p><p>The woman slowly came to life as her eyes opened, and her slightly green skin turned brighter in color. Previously, it had been pale and a little dim, but now the life could be seen from this body.</p><p>&quot;Not bad,&quot; Little Green praised as she stood up and started to turn from one side to another, looking at herself as she praised her own appearance.</p><p>&quot;It is far from as strong as I was before, but it is not as bad as I thought it would be,&quot; she continued with a smile. It was clear that she was rather happy with how things were.</p><p>Hui Yue said nothing. He was personally very satisfied with the body he had managed to create, but he was also aware that compared to the body she had had before, it was greatly lacking.</p><p>Still, Little Green was filled with excitement as she thought about how she was finally able to leave this world she had been in her whole life.</p><p>She was excited when she thought about how it would be possible for her to enter the vast Archaic World and seek out the Alchemist God.</p><p>&quot;What do you plan on doing with the hut?&quot; Hui Yue finally asked after some time. This hut was clearly of special importance to Little Green, so leaving it would not be easy. In response, she looked at it for a long time not certain what exactly she wanted to do with it.</p><p>Finally, she moved towards her home, &quot;Please follow me.&quot; She said and Hui Yue, who was rather curious followed behind her uncertain what it was she wanted him to do.</p><p>&quot;This was our home for so long,&quot; Little Green&apos;s voice trembled as her hand touched the old wood that the hut was built from. Her hand gently caressed the door hanging on its hinges, and a tender expression appeared in her eyes.</p><p>&quot;This was my starting point, but it is also my hope that one day I will be able to return here together with him. We will make ourselves a new home here and watch as the herb field grows bigger and bigger; we will grow old together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, this is nothing more than a dream of mine,&quot; she sighed, &quot;and since it is, I cannot bear it in my heart to destroy this small hut of mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If someone else reaches this godforsaken herb field and walks the path of the Alchemist God, perhaps then that person will be able to find some comfort in this small shed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Perhaps this hut will stand for an eternity, perhaps it will collapse after I leave, I do not know, but I hope that in the future someone else will find it and find their own happiness within, like how I found my happiness here.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue looked at Little Green and could sense the emotions she was feeling. She truly wished for others to find this hut and experience happiness.</p><p>&quot;In that case, let&#x2019;s hope that others find this hut,&quot; Hui Yue nodded. Although it was a naive dream, he would not shatter her dreams. This world was desolate. They had already been here for quite some time, but while they were here, not even one ancient beast had appeared. No living beings had been spotted at all apart from Little Green and the plants.</p><p>For the hut to find a new resident would be near impossible, but if it truly stayed here for eons, then there was a possibility of someone finding it, and Hui Yue could sense that this really mattered to Little Green.</p><p>After having said her farewells to the hut, Hui Yue and Little Green returned to the others who were doing their best to harvest herb after herb. Although they only harvested every third herb and left the majority of the roots in the ground, they had still spent many days and gained so many herbs that anyone would be dumbfounded if they knew.</p><p>Although they had spent so many days, they were still far from being halfway through the field, but even so, Hui Yue decided that they had been here for long enough. They had already gained a lot; it was time for them to move on.</p><p>No one complained. Although they were slightly greedy in their hearts when they had seen the herb garden at first and had wished to pick every single herb, they now understood what that statement really meant, and none of them had such thoughts anymore. They all could not help but feel that the amount of herbs they had picked were already sufficient to last for a long time.</p><p>Since this was the case, everyone in the group got ready to ascend into the heavens and leave the world when Hui Yue frowned. His attention had been caught by a large group of something that was moving towards them.</p><p>&quot;Not now,&quot; Little Green sighed. &quot;They are sylphs. Like me they were born of the vast Ancestral Worldpower within this world,&quot; she explained as Hui Yue was hovering in the air, wondering what exactly was happening and why so many of them were coming here.</p><p>&quot;Once every hundred years they will come visit me. They will try and convince me to return to our birthplace where they have built a city for sylphs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We sylphs do not reproduce like others; we do not eat nor drink. Our bodies completely rely on the Ancestral Worldpower of the world that we belong to and in a way we live in a serfdom to this world.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This world does not belong to us. This world belongs to the world itself. But even so, we are forced to look after it. If the world&apos;s Ancestral Worldpower diminishes then we too will suffer severe consequences.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because of this, we have been forced to live as slaves of this world for thousands of years.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Most sylphs does not look at it like that though. To them, this is the greatest honor. But a few are like me and disagree with this mindset, so we left the city. We left to find our own place where we could be free, but even so, it is impossible for us to be completely free.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I chose to stay by this herb field for two reasons. Firstly, because it reminds me of my time with him, and secondly because by protecting this herb field I will be able to allow for the Ancestral Worldpower in this area to keep growing stronger and stronger.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was a spirit, but I was not free.&quot; She smiled mockingly at herself as she looked into the distance watching as the sylphs came closer and closer towards them. &quot;I am no longer a sylph. I have become another kind of creature. I am not a human, but I am more like a spirit. Being a spirit is good, I can feel a freedom I have never felt before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Although I am now many times weaker than before, I have never felt so unrestrained! I am truly grateful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what do you want to do with these sylphs that have come to meet you?&quot; Hui Yue frowned. He understood that Little Green was feeling elated and sad at the same time, but in front of him was a problem he was not certain how to solve.</p><p>Little Green was hesitant. Although she was not on good terms with these sylphs, they were the only ones who had come to visit her in all the years she had been alone.</p><p>It was always the same ones who came to visit her, trying to convince her to return, and now that she was going to leave, she wished to at least say her goodbyes. Although their relationship was not good, there was some mutual respect between them.</p><p>&quot;Let us go meet them. I wish to say goodbye one last time then I can leave without feeling weighed down by anything.&quot;</p><p>Little Green was determined and decisive. As soon as she made a decision, she would stick to it no matter what. She would not be swayed by the majority around her, and she would work hard for what she believed in.</p><p>Hui Yue secretly approved of this and nodded his head. &quot;Then let&#x2019;s go meet them,&quot; he said with a smile as he once more descended from the air, everyone following him.</p><p>Although these sylphs were strong, there were only four of them while Hui Yue&apos;s group was many times bigger. There were a lot of strong individuals in his group, and thus, they would not be at a disadvantage if it came to a fight.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Little Green!&quot; one of the sylphs called out in shock when he saw the large group that was surrounding the young woman. &quot;What are you doing, once more fraternizing with Outsiders?! Have you not already learned your lesson? We sylphs are here for the world, not for dreaming about other worlds or human beings! We can never be like the humans or the beasts or any other race. We are born from Ancestral Worldpower, and we will forever be nothing more than sentient Ancestral Worldpower! Repent your actions, come back to the city, and start anew. Start worshipping the world and you will once again find happiness!&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, everyone&apos;s faces turned strange. Was it really so bad to have dreams?</p><p>Hui Yue&apos;s lips curled up into a smile filled with disdain, but he said nothing. He understood that this was a case that Little Green needed to solve on her own so he would let her. She wished to meet with these sylphs, and she would be the one to talk with them. If they went too far, then Hui Yue would not just stand by and watch.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
