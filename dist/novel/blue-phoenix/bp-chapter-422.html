Because of this, the servant placed some of the meals on the table and then left the room, letting the curtains and blankets fall leaving the family in peace within.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The embroideries on these blankets and curtains were filled with various runes. These runes blocked words from leaving the room, only letting indistinct laughter and sounds outside. While words weren&apos;t allowed out of the room, they could still hear everything from outside.</span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as the food arrived, everyone was eager to taste it, and as they did their eyes were filled with bliss. This was one of the most expensive restaurants in town, and although the price of all the meals was extravagant, the food clearly lived up to its reputation. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Tasting the food, everyone suddenly turned silent. They were savoring the great dishes and said nothing; all of them completely overwhelmed. </span></p><br><p><span style="">After some time when they had eaten the food, Hui Yue turned to Lao. &quot;Will you continue to study at the academy? One can graduate when they reach the King rank.&quot; Hui Yue asked curiously, and Lao clearly contemplated for some time.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Although I can graduate I think I am going to keep attending the classes. I did not have the chance to learn much about the basics of cultivation before, and to be honest, you are a terrible teacher.&quot; Lao said honestly while looking at Hui Yue who could not help but laugh out loud. He was perfectly well aware that he was not a good teacher. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I have no interest in doing what the Rong twins do,&quot; He said with a serious expression on his face. &quot;Although it is beneficial for the kingdom to have many strong martial arts, I am not willing to sacrifice my cultivation for something such as helping a kingdom which never assisted me.&quot; He said seriously, and Hui Yue could understand him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Lao looked at Hui Yue with serious eyes. &quot;Don&apos;t forget that you promised that when I become an Emperor, I can travel with you!&quot; He said seriously. At his statement, Hui Yue nodded his head. For once he did not laugh but was serious. &quot;When you become an Emperor you can come with me to help me with the various things I need to do.&quot; Hui Yue confirmed, and a smile appeared on Lao&apos;s face. For him, the most important thing was to become useful to Hui Yue. He felt that he owed his new father the world and he would do anything in his power to be of assistance to him. He was not willing to assist a kingdom which did nothing for him when he needed it the most.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Tell us about the Dungeons of the Divine!&quot; Jo pleaded, and with a laughter, Hui Yue and Wang Ju Long started telling them about the experiences they had gone through. Hui Yue hid nothing for these children and his lover. They were his family, and they deserved to know the truth. </span></p><br><p><span style="">While they were chatting, the servant appeared from time to time taking empty plates and placing new ones. There was a constant supply of food and hour after hour went by as the family enjoyed the delicacies while drinking the delicious peach wine. The family felt as though they were able to relax and enjoy each other&apos;s company. Even Hui Yue suppressed his feelings of grief and worry about Sha Yun to have an amazing day with his family before it was time for him to once more use all his energy to win the alchemist&#x2019;s contest.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Just as they were speaking Hui Yue suddenly frowned as he looked at the entrance to the room. The others stopped speaking and looked at Hui Yue to see if he was going to say anything but he just shook his head and smiled. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Soon after, however, the others also heard some turmoil in the lower level of the restaurant causing them to frown. They had been enjoying the time within the restaurant and now someone interrupted their good mood. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The sound came closer and closer, and soon they could hear a servant talking as well. &quot;Good sirs, the VIP rooms are all occupied. We implore you to not cause any trouble. We can reserve a room for you tomorrow!&quot; The voice was trembling and filled with fear yet, even so, he still dared to try and protect Hui Yue and the other VIP guests.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about this old man.&quot; An arrogant voice sounded out. &quot;Although there is nothing open right now, I will empty a room for you. I&apos;ll ensure that nothing bad happens to your restaurant.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">The voice was not longer distant but incredibly close, and suddenly the blankets and curtains closing off the entrance to Hui Yue and his family&apos;s room spread open. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking at the doorway, Hui Yue casually picked up a dumpling and ate it slowly, ignoring the people who had burst inside. </span></p><br><p><span style="">There was seven people: four Kings and three Emperors. All of them had an air of arrogance and as they looked at the small family within they couldn&#x2019;t help but laughed out loud. They knew they had picked the right room.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Leave now, and we will let you live!&quot; A King ranked expert said as he took a step forward as a knife appeared in his hand. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Lao, how is your training going?&quot; Hui Yue casually asked his son, and the boy in question grinned. &quot;The attack you taught me is exceptionally strong!&quot; He said. Happily, he too ignored the people who were standing in the doorway.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Good,&quot; Hui Yue nodded his head in satisfaction. This weird behavior of this father and son caused the King ranked expert who spoke earlier to lose his temper, and he charged towards Hui Yue. &quot;It&apos;s your own fault! You should have listened!&quot; He called out, but less than a second after Lao moved his hand so quickly that no one was able to see anything other than a blur and a shine of gold.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The charging expert fell to the ground with a shriek. Looking down at the legs, he found two perfect round holes which had severed his muscles and made it impossible for him to move his legs anymore.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You mongrels! This is the young master Shao!&quot; One of the Emperors called out as he too moved forward. Looking at this advancing expert a small flame appeared on top of Hui Yue&apos;s index finger. Watching the advancing expert, he flicked his finger and the flame turned to a ball of fire. This fireball was at most two centimeters in diameter, and it rapidly shot towards the Emperor. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The flame was faster than the Emperor&apos;s reaction, and suddenly the flame arrived at the head of the Emperor, right between his eyes. A shrill cry sounded out from the Emperor as the flame burned its way through his skull and ignited his brain. This caused the expert to collapse to the ground. With but a flick of his hand Hui Yue had killed an Emperor ranked expert. Fear was evident in the eyes of all the other experts who had rushed in with him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The man who was at the back, the one known as the young master Shao, was pale and terrified. He quickly found a jade slip which he crushed. The rest of the guards were jumping towards the two who had attacked, Lao and Hui Yue. Although Lao had not killed the King ranked Emperor, he would need quite a bit of attention from a healer to be okay once more.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue and Lao had stood up, both of them were ready to welcome the experts that came their way. Jo and Wang Ju Long, on the other hand, did not participate in the fight.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Jo did not participate in the fight either, but that was because both Hui Yue and Lao had told her not to. She was still a child. Both Hui Yue and Lao wished for her to stay innocent. They would rather her not kill anyone if they could help it. As long as the two of them could protect her, they would do so with all their power.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The battle was bloody. Lao used a Wu Wei art he had been given by Hui Yue. His two fingers, his index and middle finger, were pointed forward while the rest of his hand was clenched. From the tip of the two fingers, a long line of Wu Wei shot out like the blade of a sword. This was a very sharp Wu Wei sword; something Lao used to kill one person after another. All the Kings were being handled easily by Lao while Hui Yue dealt with the Emperors. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The fight was short and bloody. One guard after another fell to the ground and died. Even Lao had stopped just wounding them; his eyes were determined, and anger boiled within.</span></p><br><p><span style="">He was not willing to see anyone causing trouble for Hui Yue. Anyone who caused problems for his father had to die. He would use his powers to back up Hui Yue for the rest of his life, and if this meant he had to kill, then he would kill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue understood Lao&apos;s train of thought and smiled proudly at his son. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking at the only person left, the young master Shao, Hui Yue contemplated what to do. Killing the guards had been quite excessive but Hui Yue still felt anger that they had disturbed his quiet time with his family. Also, he had heard that they were of the Shao family, a family he did not mind crippling a little.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Deciding to cause as much trouble as possible to the Shao family Hui Yue summoned another flame on his index finger and flicked it towards the young master. He no longer paid attention to this young man since he knew that although the young master was an Emperor, he could not defend against his blue flame.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Suddenly a loud hong sound resounded through the entire restaurant. It drew Hui Yue&apos;s attention back towards the young man who was now standing behind a large middle-aged man. This man was wearing a black robe and his black hair fluttered in the wind that came from an opened door leading to a balcony. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Looking around the expression of this black dressed person turned pale, and he instantly turned around, slapping the young master so hard that he flew ten meters and vomited up blood. A look of disbelief was seen within the eyes of the young master.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Oh, if it isn&apos;t Patriarch Shao,&quot; Hui Yue said politely as he looked at the Saint in front of him. &quot;Who would have expected that you would arrive out of nowhere. Don&apos;t tell me that these experts that I was teaching a lesson to were from your family? Had I known, I would have just punished them, not killed them.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile. </span></p><br><p><span style="">His voice was friendly, and the smile on Hui Yue&apos;s face was brilliant while Patriarch Shao also smiled, but his smile was somewhat stiff. It was clear that he was in a terrible mood</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;No. No need for you to apologize.&quot; The patriarch said as he hoisted up the young master and made him bow towards Hui Yue. &quot;To know that this unfilial son of mine has caused problems, I truly apologize,&quot; Shao said, and his son, gritting his teeth, understood what his father wanted and said. &quot;This lowly one apologizes for the trouble caused.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Young master Shao had never been treated like this before and felt like vomiting up even more blood from having to apologize to the person who had killed all his guards. This was an injustice he would never live down!</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
