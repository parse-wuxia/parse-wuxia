It&#x2019;s worth nothing to me. Take out something more valuable.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Chen&apos;s face turned green when he heard what Hui Yue said, but instead of taking out something else, he roared to the sky and charged at Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing his sudden outburst of anger, and the sudden attack, Hui Yue was not fearful. Right now he had the full support of the black figure, and when he lifted his hand, he clenched it slowly. This caused space around him to start twisting and churning, and suddenly Pei Chen was stopped in his tracks; he could not move even an inch, and he couldn&#x2019;t even blink his eyelids. &#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing Pei Chen stunned like this everyone was shocked but Hui Yue just walked forward very slowly. As he reached this expert who was frozen in place, Hui Yue took out his sword.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your life? You bet your life? Unfortunately, I am not very interested in owning your life so why don&apos;t you just die already?&quot; The cold words that Hui Yue said shocked everyone present. Although Pei Chen was not one of the strongest members of the inner sect, he was still a direct descendant of the great roc! He was revered by countless outer sect disciples.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master Hui Yue, it&#x2019;s good to see you again,&quot; Pei Ze&apos;s voice suddenly sounded out, and hearing it, Hui Yue instantly withdrew his sword into the Universe Box. He nodded his head, but still did not release Pei Chen from the locked space he was trapped within.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Behind Pei Ze was an elder, and the moment these experts saw him, all of them fell to their knees, even the Fu brothers were no exception and bowed in respect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">After a moment only a handful of experts remained standing. Hui Yue could tell that these experts were most likely inner sect disciples.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master Hui Yue, this is elder Pei Qin. He is one of the head elders in our Celestial Sword Sect.&quot; Pei Ze said politely as he introduced the elderly man behind him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Hui Yue greets elder Pei Qin,&quot; Hui Yue said as he cupped his hands and bowed to the elder. Although he bowed, it was not as deep a bow as the others had given him. This caused the elder&#x2019;s eye to rise in surprise.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I&#x2019;ve heard quite a bit about your performance and to see the spacelock you used on young Pei Chen it is indeed true that you are a talent we don&apos;t see often.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing the word spacelock, everyone present was completely shocked.</p><p dir="ltr">What did a spacelock technique signify? It signified that the expert had many insights into the dao of space, one of the most elusive and powerful daos that existed! Although it was not a major dao, the power one gained from the dao of space was even more outstanding than some major daos.</p><p dir="ltr">The experts who had looked at Hui Yue with disdain and disrespect now looked as if they saw a monster. It was clear that Hui Yue was just a new God. The amount of Ancestral Worldpower one had could not be faked, but he was actually able to comprehend the dao of space while at such a level! It was obvious that he had not even been a God for a thousand years!</p><p dir="ltr">Actually, the truth was even more shocking. If they knew that Hui Yue had not even been a God for a decade, everyone would be coughing up blood in anger at his impossibly quick cultivation speed. However, Hui Yue had absorbed the souls of two Gods and a large group of mortal souls that had already shattered. From this Hui Yue had been able to deepen the amount of Ancestral Worldpower that his body could contain giving the impression that although he was a new God. In reality, because of all of his many experiences up to now, he was not as new as he appeared.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;To have comprehended the dao of space and have some control over soulforce while just having ascended to the God rank... It is indeed rare for such an outstanding seedling to appear. Were it not for being the result of someone breaking sect laws you would already have been one of our most outstanding individuals of the younger generation, but since your situation is so unique, I am unable to make a decision on my own.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Having spoken for some time elder Pei Qin pondered for a bit of time before he finally nodded his head. &quot;Come with me,&quot; he said as he turned around to leave. His arms behind his back, the group consisting of the Fu brothers, Pei Ze, Pei Qin, Hui Yue, and Huli turned to leave.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they left the spacelock around Pei Chen collapsed, and the man who had been locked in space gasped for air. A cold sweat ran down his face, and he shuddered in fear. It seemed that the one he had insulted was actually a dragon amongst men! Trembling with rage, he watched the group depart and shook his head. He grit his teeth and swore that he would gain back every bit of face he lost today ten-fold! He had always hated Pei Ze&apos;s faction and supported he supported his rival, and thus he instantly turned to leave, ready to tell his master about this young man.</p><p dir="ltr">Elder Pei Qin led Hui Yue and the others into one of the main buildings and walked through many corridors and chambers before reaching a set of double doors. As he opened the door, Hui Yue saw that there were even more elderly experts waiting inside. In total there were five experts here, which just showed exactly how important this Judge of Hell trial was to the Celestial Sword Sect.</p><p dir="ltr">The elders all turned to look at Hui Yue and the group, their eyes displayed the question in their hearts.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Elder Qin, why did you bring in such a group of experts?&quot; One of the elders asked curiously. She was a woman who appeared to be around fifty years old, and she had a gentle air about her as she looked at Hui Yue and Pei Ze.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Elder Ziqi, this is Hui Yue; a young man whom I think we should pay some attention to,&quot; Elder Pei Qin said with a mysterious smile on his lips.</p><p dir="ltr">These elders were not dumb. To have become a head elder of the Celestial Sword Sect one needed both cunningness and power so when they heard Elder Pei Qin&apos;s words, they all instantly focused on Hui Yue. Looking at this young cultivator, their hearts filled with confusion.</p><p dir="ltr">This cultivator was clearly a new God. He had become a God quite recently, and even if he were fairly talented, he would have at most join the outer sects and become a powerful ally in the future. Was it really something they needed to make such a big fuss about?</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Come forth,&quot; Pei Qin said and gestured for Hui Yue to move forward which he instantly did.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Display your wings,&quot; he ordered, and Hui Yue, who was a little perplexed did as he was told and summoned forth the wings from his core.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The wings were massive and displaced their brilliance to full effect in the dimly lit room. The wings were simply massive. Each wing had a wingspan of three meters, and they were so stunningly pretty and clear.</p><p dir="ltr">Within the Celestial Sword Sect, the purer one&apos;s bloodline, the larger one&apos;s wings were, and wings of this size had not been seen in the younger generation within at least the last five thousand years.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;He is a descendant of the great roc?!&quot; The elder that previously had been referred to as elder Ziqi was shocked, and it was not just her, all the others were just as shocked when they saw this. At their shock and her question elder Pei Qin merely smiled and shook his head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Display your wolf form, please,&quot; he continued to ask, and hearing the elder&#x2019;s polite tone, Hui Yue decided it was best to do as he was told. He went into his core and reached out for the red mist after which his body underwent an outstanding transformation and changed to the body of half wolf, half human.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The elders who were already shocked became flabbergasted upon seeing this. They had never heard of it being possible to mix two bloodlines, yet within the body of this young man was just this, two bloodlines mixed with one another.</p><p dir="ltr">Elder Pei Qin smiled smugly as he cleared his throat. The sound brought the other elders back from their shock, but just as they were about to speak about how much of an unprecedented talent he was, Elder Pei Qin raised his hand. &quot;I need a volunteer,&quot; he said, and elder Ziqi stepped forward. &quot;Can I help?&quot; She asked curiously.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point, all the elders were shocked about what exactly Pei Qin needed a volunteer for.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Use your technique from earlier on this woman,&quot; Elder Pei Qin said as he pointed at Pei Ziqi, and Hui Yue reached his core once more.</p><p dir="ltr">He felt that the black figure was not very willing to lend him the powers, but it was also aware of which kind of situation he and Huli would be in if he did not establish himself as someone useful. Thus it allowed for Hui Yue to merge with his power and use it to fight. Although Hui Yue could feel his unwillingness, he did not care. He reached out his hand after which he clenched it as he looked at the woman.</p><p dir="ltr">Space twisted and churned. It started cracking as it froze around this woman but it lasted for only a moment before the woman broke free.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Truly a deep understanding of the dao of space!&quot; Pei Ziqi said shocked as she looked at Hui Yue as if he were a small monster.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Little boy, can you make spatial tears in the fabric of reality?&quot; She asked shocked, and Hui Yue quickly summoned forth his sword of the icy tempest. With the help of the black figure, he tore a hole in the surrounding space much like the one he had torn when he banished the dragon.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Flipping his hand the sword vanished once more and he bowed deeply to Pei Ziqi who was standing with a very complicated expression on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;There is one more thing,&quot; Pei Qin said with a teasing voice. &quot;Although Hui Yue has stunned us time and time again he also has another innate gift: soulforce!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">It was as if his words thundered through the room. The faces of the elders turned pale, and their eyes widened. They all almost gaped as they looked at Hui Yue. This young man had one secret after another, and all of them were so outstanding.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Qin was quiet for some time. His face was clearly filled with satisfaction as he had managed to shock these experts time and time again, but after waiting a few moments, he sighed deeply.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Alas, although this youngster has so many benefits, we need to take into consideration that he is the result of someone breaking our sect&#x2019;s rules. To have relations with a mortal outside of the sect and produce an offspring is a great offense, and according to sect laws he and his parents should be punished.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">When Pei Qin spoke, the faces of the elders turned increasingly ugly. They knew that it was indeed a serious offense, but on the other hand, it had brought them such a genius. How could they not want to bring him into the sect and raise him?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even Pei Ze on the side was eager to let Hui Yue enter. He wanted to grow a close relationship with Hui Yue and have him as a trusted ally.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze was smart. His goal was not to become a head elder but to become the sect leader. His goal was as high up as the heavens and to succeed he would need powerful people supporting him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he had not known Hui Yue for long, he already understood that this young man was not interested in power struggles. This was the reason he was the ideal person to have as an ally. He would do everything in his power to reel him in and take him under his wing.</p><br></div><p></p>
