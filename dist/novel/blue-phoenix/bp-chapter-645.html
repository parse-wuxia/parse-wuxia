All of them instantly grabbed a pill and swallowed it.</p><p>As soon as it entered their mouths, they could feel energy bursting out from within the pill. It filled their bodies with Ancestral Worldpower, restoring all the energy they had spent up until then.</p><p>The faces of the Yanluo Guards all twisted in surprise as they felt how the energy continued to rise. This energy allowed them to have even more energy now than they had before the battle started. They instantly and simultaneously gave a strange look to Hui Yue. How could he afford to give such outstanding pills to others?</p><p>Even so, no one thanked him. Instead, they all engraved their gratitude deep within their hearts and stared at the group of Immortals of Creation that was moving towards them.</p><p>The moment they moved forward, every other demon backed away so they would not get caught in the crossfire.</p><p>There were a hundred and ten of these strong Immortals of Creation, enough to make Hui Yue sneer in annoyance.</p><p>The guards could handle one of these expert demons each, and Hui Yue, Huli, Wei, and Cai Jie could also deal with one each. Amongst the rest, though, some of the beast gods could also deal with them one on one, but the rest had to group up to be able to deal with one. Although they could manage most Immortals of Creation, these were the elite!</p><p>Hui Yue took a deep breath. It had been a long time since he had last fought a real expert, especially one who emitted such a shocking aura as these experts did, but he also felt an urge to battle. Killing intent roared within him, causing the temperature in the atmosphere to drop.</p><p>He reached inside of his core for the red gem, causing a mountain-like shadow to appear behind him, allowing him to vividly feel how his defense began to increase drastically. He also felt how he could control the dao of gravity, the dao of stones, and the dao of mud.</p><p>These daos were those he had learned to control through his frequent use of the red gem. The more he used the red gem, the more the daos appeared to him. He also understood that it was possible that the memory in his mind, the red gem, was an Immortal of Creation that had comprehended the full dao of Earth.</p><p>This red gem granted him outstanding defense. He could not help but think about what it would be like to merge with it. Without a doubt, his strength would soar once more.</p><p>Having reached for the red gem and subsequently felt his defense rise, Hui Yue did not stop there but went straight for the star. The star was shining brightly inside of Hui Yue&apos;s core. When he touched it, he felt light as a feather. His entire world was illuminated, and he could feel how the dao of light was just about to break into his mind. As a matter of fact, he had already comprehended a few daos of light and a part of the dao of time because of the star within him.</p><p>Even after touching the star and the red gem, Hui Yue continued on. He reached forward to touch the black figure. This black figure had never shown any affection for Hui Yue, but it was clear what it felt for Huli. Due to her, it allowed for Hui Yue to use it as he pleased. Especially in situations like these where Huli, too, was in danger.</p><p>Having reached out to the red gem, the star, and the black figure, Hui Yue continued. He released the red mist and the blue clouds.</p><p>While the blue cloud consumed all the energy in the surrounding area and allowed for Hui Yue to use it to replenish himself, the red mist consumed souls. It kept dragging souls towards him which in turn nourished and restored his soulforce.</p><p>Having done everything he could to prepare himself, Hui Yue&apos;s eyes locked onto an elite demon that was heading towards him. A chill ran through his body as he understood that these elite experts were without a doubt the strongest foes he had ever faced. It was clear that he needed to take this seriously.</p><p>Even Huli, Wei, and Cai Jie were serious as they looked at the elite army that was advancing towards them.</p><p>&quot;Time to see just how strong I have become!&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself. He clenched his fist and felt the Ancestral Worldpower in his body roaring in response to his eagerness to do battle.</p><p>Although Hui Yue felt the urge to head towards this elite demon and fight him right now, he understood that he was the target of everyone present. If he was stupid enough to go out there to meet one of the demons, it was obvious that all of them would swarm towards him.</p><p>Even now, all of them were going towards him, but they were being picked up one after another by the Yanluo Guards and his companions.</p><p>Hui Yue narrowed his eyes as he made eye contact with the same elite demon he had seen before. As their eyes made contact, it was as if sparks flew from both sides, and the demon sped up its advance.</p><p>It managed to maneuver past every one of the Yanluo Guards and the rest. Its killing intent soared. It raised the machete in its hand, roaring out loud.</p><p>The roar caused shockwaves to spread from the demon, resulting in disturbance to the other fighters. Even the other demons were swept away by the shockwave. It was clear that this demon was very strong!</p><p>It was not the strongest in the group. The strongest was currently fighting Huli. The demon had even forced her into a state where she had to assume her original shape. A massive black nine-tailed fox towered and fought on the ship-like shuttle, engaged in a frenzied battle with the demon commander.</p><p>Every single clash that happened between the commander and Huli caused the ship-like shuttle to tremble and tip from side to side.</p><p>But all the others were too busy engaging in their own battles to notice. Amongst the hundred and ten elite demons, one was a commander, nine were captains, and the rest were the elite troops; the opponent that Hui Yue had found was one of the captains.</p><p>This captain was filled with murderous intent as he strode through the corpse-filled deck of the ship-like shuttle. Sometimes the sound of bones splintering could be heard as he stepped on demons that had lost their lives in the previous skirmish. There was not the slightest bit of care towards his fallen comrades.</p><p>&quot;Your head is mine!&quot; The demon yelled towards Hui Yue as it swung its machete overhead. However, Hui Yue only chuckled as he felt how the beastly instincts of the Red Wolf erupted from within him.</p><p>&quot;I hope your neck is nice and clean for when I cut off your head!&quot; Hui Yue replied with a sinister voice, nothing like his normal self.</p><p>He flicked his hand, and the Sword of the Icy tempest appeared, firmly placed inside his grip.</p><p>As the sword appeared, thunder started to break out in the otherwise silent galaxy. It was as if the appearance of the sword itself had caused the thunder to break out, and the eyes of the demon glittered with greed.</p><p>&quot;A treasured sword!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Thank you for bringing me such a fine gift, I will gladly accept it together with your severed head!&quot;</p><p>Both of them were smiling, but their smiles had not an ounce of gentleness. The demon came closer and closer. At first, he had been walking slowly. But the closer he came, the faster he moved, gathering momentum for the first attack.</p><p>Hui Yue on the other hand used the blue cloud around him to stay in peak condition. He gathered more and more Ancestral Worldpower into his body.</p><p>He had opened his mind and poured the dao of gravity out together with the dao of the sword.</p><p>As soon as the rapidly advancing demon entered the gravity field, cracking sounds could be heard as the deck underneath the demon suddenly started showing signs of caving in. With each step he took, a deep footprint was left behind.</p><p>His speed was also affected, and the momentum he had built up was partly dissipated due to the sudden change in gravity. He needed to use much more energy to be able to move forward than he had done before.</p><p>Even so, the machete came crashing down towards Hui Yue, who lifted his sword now infused with his full capacity for Ancestral Worldpower while augmented by the dao of the sword.</p><p>Shining swordlight burst forth from the blade, cutting through the air while leaving spatial rifts in its wake. These spatial rifts began sucking in the energy in their vicinities in order to mend themselves</p><p>The arm of the demon was also cut by these shockingly strong swordlights, but the collision had forced Hui Yue three steps back. Who came out on top in this exchange, no one could tell for sure.</p><p>Neither man nor demon wasted any time. With a yell, they both sprung forward once more, and machete and sword met each other, sparks flying off their colliding edges. Spatial rifts were ripped open in the surrounding space, and the deck floor that they stood on was taking one cut after another, showing signs of giving out. Nonetheless, even if it did collapse, it wouldn&#x2019;t affect their fighting ability. None of them stepped on the ground anymore but flew in the air.</p><p>The machete and the sword kept connecting. One exchange the demon would have the upper hand, but at the next, it was Hui Yue.</p><p>Both were using a dao. Hui Yue was using the dao of the sword while the demon was also using the dao of the sword. Both daos were equal when it came to their strength, and Hui Yue and the Demon were also evenly matched.</p><p>Although Hui Yue had the defense of the red gem, he was still starting to get small cuts all over his body as a result of the strong sword light that erupted from the demon&apos;s weapon in every exchange. The demon was not much better off; he too was getting wound after wound in their continuous exchanges.</p><p>&apos;You can&apos;t let it continue like this,&apos; Lan Feng said with a sigh, &apos;I know you want to compete in raw strength, but it is clear you are evenly matched. If the fight drags on you are going to be on the losing end. Although you have the blue cloud, your Ancestral Worldpower pool is much smaller than an Immortal of Creation, so give it up and take this battle seriously!&apos;</p><p>Hui Yue gritted his teeth as he heard the sad truth from the bird. Instead of getting mad, he retreated four steps and swung his hand, storing the Sword of the Icy Tempest within his Universe Box once more.</p><p>&quot;I have no other choice than to do this then!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed and reached out for the Celestial Wings in his core. The moment he touched them a blinding light erupted on the battlefield and Hui Yue, who looked like an angel with the celestial wings and the white hair wafting around him, lifted an arm.</p><p>The dao of wind suddenly gathered around him. The thunder from before became even more evident now; the wind was slowly picking up in the previously still galaxy. However, it was not just any wind; it was a wild and raging tempest.</p><p>Within this tempest, wind blades were hidden, and these wind blades were infused with the dao of the sword.</p><p>It was impossible to merge two daos with each other if they were not under the same major dao, but they could be used together. Since a wind blade was classified as a sword, the dao of the sword could be attached to it.</p><p>Using these two daos together required a lot of the user&apos;s concentration and not just this. The consumption of Ancestral Worldpower was simply too great, but Hui Yue understood that he had to do all in his power if he wished to defeat the demon in front of him.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
