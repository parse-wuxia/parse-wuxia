We are fighting for freedom, so even if we have to fight more cultivators, we will do all that we can!&quot; he sneered from behind the mask. Spearlight erupted from his spear and was infused with his two daos, and they collided head-on, causing massive shockwaves to appear and reduce many of the surrounding Blood Demons to nothing, crushing both their bodies and souls.</p><p>Hui Yue understood that although he was talking as if they held the upper hand, the truth was they did not. The two sides were equal in strength because the demons were more experienced, while the other had more people.</p><p>Wang Ju Long was attacking in a frenzy. Her spearlight was filled with the dao of death, and since they were on a battlefield where death was everywhere, her dao was constantly increasing in power.</p><p>The daos were everywhere, but the dao of death was descending with such force that the other daos were being pushed aside slightly. Although Wang Ju Long had only comprehended one dao, her dao was currently much stronger than any other heavenly dao. It could almost match up to two heavenly daos, especially since the dao of life was almost pushed away from the surrounding areas. This was due to the environment they were in. Death was simply everywhere.</p><p>This was not only a benefit for Wang Ju Long but a benefit for everyone who had comprehended the heavenly dao of death. Unfortunately, the dao of death was very hard to grasp, and thus not many had comprehended it.</p><p>Hui Yue and Lan Feng, on the other hand, were in a bit of a pickle due to having comprehended the heavenly dao of life.</p><p>The heavenly dao of life was mostly useful in an area surrounding where lifeforce was blossoming, which that could be any kind of life, plants, living beings, and so on.</p><p>Although there were many living beings on the battleground, a vast majority were dying or had the aura of death around them from killing and fighting with their lives on the line.</p><p>The heavenly dao of life was capable of stealing away other&apos;s lifeforce, but the most powerful use of the dao was to heal, to allow for things to grow and to control the living.</p><p>Obviously, the dao could also be used to attack; it could be layered like the major daos, and that was what Hui Yue was currently doing. Every attack was absorbing the lifeforce of his opponents, while also bringing down heavens&#x2019; wrath.</p><p>Since the armies were fighting in the heavens, it was clear that the dao of the heavens was almost as strong as the dao of death. Everyone was fighting in the heavens, and thus the rules of the heavens applied to everyone.</p><p>It caused cultivators to plummet to the ground making them feel as if the heavens did not invite them any longer, and the power of the heavens could slay weaker cultivators as easily as breathing.</p><p>The masked demon had comprehended the heavenly dao of the earth and the heavenly dao of death. Although his dao of death was overwhelmingly powerful, his dao of the earth was currently very weak as they were in the skies fighting out their war.</p><p>Swordlight and spearlight collided and Hui Yue suddenly waved his hands. Nine shining beams of light appeared shooting towards the Blood Demon with such speed that not even their trained eyes could see them clearly.</p><p>These nine lights were the Nine Peach Leaves, and they were razor sharp as they sliced through the heavens causing the fabric of reality to tremble. They were headed straight for the masked demon&apos;s vitals.</p><p>The masked demon felt a cold chill run down his spine as he hurriedly backed away, but it was impossible for him to be as fast as the Nine Peach Leaves. Just as he moved, one of the blades managed to slice clean through one of his horns.</p><p>A grunt of pain escaped the lips of the Blood Demon, and the mask which had been hiding his face started to fall together with the horn.</p><p>&quot;You bastard, you cut my horn!&quot; a loud howl erupted from his lips, and when the mask fell, Hui Yue saw that the Blood Demon had small spikes all over his face. It looked like he had small horns of a few millimeters long all over his face.</p><p>In fact, he looked like a prickly fruit, but Hui Yue had no time to laugh at the sight or get any amusement from his appearance, because the dao of death erupted with a strength Hui Yue had not seen before.</p><p>It was clear that the strength of the demon in front of him just increased dramatically after being filled with rage, but fortunately, his rationality had fallen as a result.</p><p>The Nine Peach Leaves were not just standing still in the air after the attack, they constantly moved around the Blood Demon. They retreated, gathered momentum, and shot back towards him, while Hui Yue with the Celestial Sword was constantly attacking with his swordlight.</p><p>Hui Yue held the advantage of being able to attack with both his soulforce and daos. His soulforce made use of the Nine Peach Leaves, and they had become flying swords that cut through anything, but at the same time, the Blood Demon was not completely useless.</p><p>He was able to use the length of his spear to block multiple attacks with just one spearlight, causing the many and rapid attacks of Hui Yue to be completely useless.</p><p>Both the Blood Demon and Hui Yue were starting to feel exhausted. It was clear that they were using up all their Ancestral Worldpower to fuel their bodies, and the strain on them that came with using the dao continuously was also a problem, however, Hui Yue suddenly grinned and waved his hand.</p><p>A small red pill and a bigger green one appeared in his hand, and he quickly popped them into his mouth.</p><p>The first pill was a Nirvana Renewal pill, a pill which allowed for the body to withstand the dao, and to heal the damage that the dao might have caused to the user.</p><p>The other pill was a simple but effective Revival pill, a pill that restored Ancestral Worldpower.</p><p>Both of these pills had a very high purity, and they were using the formulas that Hui Yue had obtained from the Alchemist God. Because the Alchemist God personally made the formulas they were even more powerful than the ordinary versions of the pills.</p><p>The moment they entered his mouth, Hui Yue felt how they turned into streams of energy that dissipated throughout his body. His body which was starting to feel exhausted suddenly became relaxed and comfortable once more.</p><p>The Ancestral Worldpower entered his Ancestral Worldpower pool as if it were a waterfall falling into an empty well, and it filled up his reserves completely.</p><p>&quot;You are cheating!&quot; The Blood Demon exclaimed shocked and unhappy, but Hui Yue just chuckled as he sent more and more attacks out with his renewed strength.</p><p>&quot;This is war. There is no cheating. You can do whatever you want as long as you make sure to win!&quot; he exclaimed, and his voice reverberated through the entire battlefield.</p><p>The humans laughed when they heard this, and all of Hui Yue&apos;s friends who recognized his voice laughed even harder.</p><p>Humanity had always followed a code of chivalry and of treateding everyone fairly, so the Blood Demons were shocked to see how Hui Yue was acting so indifferent when he clearly was being unfair to his opponent.</p><p>The demon was filled with frustration. He had already acknowledged that this would be a hard fought battle, but if Hui Yue had pills to heal himself, then he had no chance of winning. But retreating was not an option either.</p><p>Just as he was unsure what he should do, so he just spent all his remaining power attacking Hui Yue.</p><p>So far both Hui Yue and the Blood Demon had gained multiple cuts and smaller wounds on their bodies as they had been hit by the shockwaves and wayward sword and spearlights, but none of them had managed to seriously injure the other.</p><p>Now that he had decided to spend all his energy on Hui Yue, the demon focused all his attention on Hui Yue. His eyes did not leave Hui Yue, and it was as if the two of them were in a world of their own.</p><p>The Blood Demon did not even notice that Wang Ju Long was inching closer and closer as he was gathering momentum, preparing to strike.</p><p>Hui Yue, on the other hand, was on high alert. His entire focus was on the spearpoint, and he was preparing to accept this attack to ensure that it would be the final attack and end the battle.</p><p>But the attack never arrived. Suddenly the Blood Demon felt a piercing pain in his chest, and when he looked down, he saw that a big spear had been stabbed into his chest.</p><p>He had let his guard down. He had placed all his focus on Hui Yue, forgetting everything about Wang Ju Long who was also present, and in the end, his inattention let his opponent get the best of him.</p><p>Blood oozed out of his mouth, and his eyes showed unwillingness.</p><p>Wang Ju Long was close to the Blood Demon, and the whole momentum and attack that had been aimed at Hui Yue suddenly changed targets.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wang Ju Long had added the dao of death to her attack, and for every single moment that went by, the Blood Demon&#x2019;s lifeforce was being corroded. His eyes turned dim, and his body lost strength, but he still launched his final attack at Wang Ju Long who released her spear and retreated as fast as she could.</p><p>The spear grazed her arm, and a large gash appeared, almost severing it. Her bone within was visible, and she grit her teeth in pain before her hand retracted a healing pill from her storage treasure.</p><p>&quot;Go assist Lan Feng, I will heal myself while we wait,&quot; Wang Ju Long said as she placed the pill in her mouth and returned to the now dead Blood Demon. She grasped her spear and dragged it out from his body before she allowed for it to drop down to the ground, where dead bodies had already piled up to form massive mountains.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Blood Demons, humans, and beasts had already died, and more were dying every moment.</p><p>Hui Yue gave a tender glance at Wang Ju Long. She had been wounded for his sake, but she had also managed to kill a Blood Demon that was more than twice as strong as her. It was quite an achievement.</p><p>&quot;Look after yourself!&quot; Hui Yue said before he turned around and headed towards Lan Feng.</p><p>Lan Feng and the dog demon had strayed pretty far away while they fought. Lan Feng in his phoenix shape was incredibly big, and every single movement caused more than a few meters to be traversed.</p><p>The dog demon was not as big, and he was much more agile so for this reason he was able to dodge Lan Feng&#x2019;s attacks most of the time. But even so Lan Feng&apos;s claws were as swift as an attacking snake, and he received quite a few scratches.</p><p>When Hui Yue caught up and saw Lan Feng, he noticed that blood was dyeing his blue feathers red, and it was clear that he too had received many blows.</p><p>Every single attack of theirs caused more and more Blood Demons to lose their lives and fall to the ground, and Hui Yue grinned when he saw this.</p><p>The army of humanity was doing decently in the war.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
