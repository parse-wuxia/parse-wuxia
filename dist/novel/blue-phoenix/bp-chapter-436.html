The voice billowed with killing intent, and even Patriarch Shao turned pale. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;He found us.&quot; He said with a low voice. Although Hui Yue did say that he would hunt down and kill everyone who was a part of the attack, Patriarch Shao did not believe that he was serious. Now, though, he understood that the white-haired man had been completely serious when swearing to hunt them all down, and the first place he came too was the Shao family. There was no question about why he was here and the patriarch was suddenly uncertain as to what to do. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Should he show himself, and most likely end up getting killed, or should he hide where he was now, the innermost areas of his family&#x2019;s mansion, and hope that Hui Yue did not become serious with his threat of being ruthless and fighting his way into the innermost areas of the Shao family? </span></p><br><p><span style="">The patriarch knew perfectly well that there was no one in his family apart from him who could stop or even slow down Hui Yue. Thinking this, he finally started regretting his actions. They should have fought Hui Yue before instead of fleeing, but instead, they were now the ones who were dying. </span></p><br><p><span style="">A boom sounded out, a boom so loud that the ground shook and the buildings trembled. &quot;Come out Patriarch Shao, or I will kill your entire family.&quot; Hui Yue called once more, and with a sigh, the patriarch finally came to the conclusion that Hui Yue was serious. He really would slay his entire family if he did not appear. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Patriarch Shao was in a difficult situation. Should he sacrifice his family and live? Live to grow stronger and someday seek revenge, or should he sacrifice himself to let his family keep living.</span></p><br><p><span style="">His family would, without a doubt, no longer be one of the most influential families once he died, and their young experts would have a hard time cultivating compared to how it was now. But was he really willing to sacrifice his children, sacrifice his nephews, sisters, and brothers? Was he willing to let the older generation of the Shao family alongside everyone he had grown up with die? </span></p><br><p><span style="">Patriarch Shao had not moved as he was deciding if he was willing to sacrifice himself for his family; however, after hearing yet another thundering noise resound he his heart turned cold, and he had a crazed look on his face.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Right! Right, right, right! He has already killed too many of my family&apos;s members after leveling those buildings... Having lost so many, the heavens have already made the decision for me!&quot; He argued and turned to look at his son with cold eyes. Had it not been for his son having insulted Hui Yue at the inn then maybe he would not have guessed that they were part of the plot against him. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Son, I&#x2019;m leaving.&quot; Patriarch Shao said seriously. &quot;You can follow me if you have the ability to do so, if not blame your own inability.&quot; He said as he jumped on his flying sword and flew into a tunnel in the basement; a tunnel which led all the way out of the city.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While Patriarch Shao was fleeing, Hui Yue continuously scanned the ground around the Shao family compound. Unfortunately, it was impossible to reach far enough into the ground to find the Shao Patriarch. After leveling two buildings and not seeing the patriarch emerge, Hui Yue assumed that he had fled. </span></p><br><p><span style="">On his flying sword, he dove into the mansion grounds and entered the main office. Any guard who tried to block him was knocked flying some dead, others alive. Soon they stopped trying to block him and allowed him to move as he pleased. They too had realized that they had been sacrificed by their patriarch and their hearts were heavy, filled with unwillingness and hatred. They had given their lives to the Shao family, but now when they need their patriarch the most, he had chosen to save himself rather than protect the family. There was no longer any point in trying to block Hui Yue, and a large portion of the Shao family started to revolt. The people took all the items they found of value before they left the mansion.</span></p><br><p><span style="">One of the most renown families within Muchuan city slowly started to collapse from the inside. While this was happening, Hui Yue kept moving further and further into the underground rooms within the family mansion. Fewer and fewer experts met him, and as he reached the lowest part, he finally found the secret room in which the patriarch had spoken with his son. Though, both were long gone through the secret tunnel. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The moment he saw this tunnel, Hui Yue summoned his flying sword soared through it at his fastest speed. It did not take him long before he found the young son. This was because he was not flying on a flying sword, the Shao family, although rich, were not willing to spend the amount of money a flying sword cost on anyone other than their Saint. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Finding this young man, Hui Yue could not help but have a ruthless smile on his face as he struck out with his palm, and with a single move broke the neck of the young master. Hui Yue was fully enraged by Patriarch Shao&apos;s decision to sacrificing his family for his own life. </span></p><br><p><span style="">To someone like Hui Yue, this was simply unacceptable to the extreme. Although he had some goals in life, there were people he would never sacrifice no matter what. They were people who were very important to him, and if he had to risk his life to save them, then so be it. He would give his all for his friends and family. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Although Hui Yue said that he would be ruthless, he never intended to kill their entire family. Even now after the patriarch had left, he would never take his anger out on the family. But as it looked, he did not need to. The family had already collapsed. Although the Shao family would remain in Muchuan City, it would now be far smaller and insignificant compared to their past. This was due to the betrayal of their patriarch. His actions caused the family to suffer much more than Hui Yue who had only killed a handful of guards.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Rushing through the tunnel, Hui Yue flew far quicker than Patriarch Shao. Although he left quite a bit earlier as Hui Yue came to the end of the tunnel, he caught up to the patriarch. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Patriarch Shao, what a pleasure to see you here.&quot; He sneered as his entire body turned to that of a wolf. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Seeing the change in Hui Yue, Patriarch Shao&apos;s heart shuddered, and he poured all his Wu Wei into the sword beneath him. A snapping sound was heard as the sword crumbled into thousands of pieces; the ordinary sword was simply incapable of handling so much Wu Wei. The patriarch had hoped to use his extra energy to soar through the sky, but he now found that he was falling to the ground in a rather ungraceful way. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Watching this, Hui Yue could not help but laugh before he flew over to where Patriarch Shao vanished. Just as he arrived, Hui Yue found traces of blood on the ground. He guessed that despite his opponent being a Saint, the fall had still caused him to be wounded. </span></p><br><p><span style="">There was only some blood on the ground, but even so, Hui Yue, who was half in wolf form could easily smell where the wounded man had gone. With a howl, he chased after. </span></p><br><p><span style="">He quickly arrived at the location where Patriarch Shao was clutching his leg and leaning against a massive boulder, catching his breath.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Patriarch Shao was bloodied, and his leg was clearly broken. His clothes were all in disarray. His hair was wild and unruly, and his eyes wide, full of disbelief. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You beast!&quot; He cursed as he saw Hui Yue calmly walk towards him. &quot;You might be able to kill me, but even if you hunt us all down, don&apos;t think you have won!&quot; He swore, but his words were useless to Hui Yue. Any feeling of pity vanished alongside his wish to sacrifice his family to save himself. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I don&apos;t care about winning or losing.&quot; Hui Yue said with a serious voice. &quot;All that matters to me is to protect the ones I love. Killing you is so you can never threaten those I care about again.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">The more Hui Yue spoke, the more his killing intent increased. Soon he was waiting to kill Patriarch Shao; his entire body was emitting a killing intent so overpowering that the patriarch was instantly drowned in fear. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I.. I never meant to!&quot; He started stuttering. &quot;It was not my intention. I was forced by the others.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;If you let me live, I will tell you who the others were.&quot; He tried, but Hui Yue looked at him indifferently as he inched closer and closer to Patriarch Shao. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Reaching him, the patriarch had already gone mad. He jumped towards the large red wolf in front of him, putting his full force inside the attack, staking his life on the succession Snorting, Hui Yue just took his strong paw and placed it around Patriarch Shao&apos;s neck and with a squeeze of his hand the life left the patriarch. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Think I would let you live? Dream on. Although it might be troublesome to find the rest of the Saints, I do not believe it is impossible. I am on the verge of breaking into the Saint rank. Those who were previously my match will now be far below me.&#x201D;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue spoke to no one in particular before he once more summoned his black sword and shot like a blur of light towards the massive city behind him. </span></p><br><p><span style="">When he arrived at the city, no one asked him whether or not he had met the patriarch; no one dared to ask as they were not sure they wanted to know the answer. Hui Yue was back in his human form as he flew towards the Hui mansion. He could feel that he was incredibly close to reaching the Saint rank, and his heart was leaping with excitement. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Reaching the mansion he went straight to his room. He did not meet with either Wang Ju Long or Sha Yun, and both of them quickly understood that something special was happening as he shut himself in his room. </span></p><br><p><span style="">At first, they were curious about what he was doing, but none of them wished to enter the room and disturb him when he was training. During the first week, everyone would often pause outside the door waiting to see what was happening inside, but as time went by they spent less time in front of this room. After a month had passed no one thought about his closed-door cultivation. As two months rolled by they missed him a lot but understood that he was facing a major bottleneck.</span></p><br><p><span style="">After seven months the door to the room finally opened once more as Hui Yue stepped out. A whole new aura was radiating from his body, and his eyes shone with excitement and understanding. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Father!&quot; Lao was the first to notice his father had finished his cultivation and he called out excitedly, yet the moment the words left his mouth, his jaw dropped in shock as he understood why his father had been cultivating so hard. &quot;Father! You managed to become a Saint?!&quot; He called out excitedly.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
