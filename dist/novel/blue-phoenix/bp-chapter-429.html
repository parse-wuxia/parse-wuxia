The information about the miraculous pill that could make anyone with enough perseverance into a King ranked expert was simply inconceivable. </span></p><br><p><span style="">While the big families started considering how to get their hands on these pills, others started to fear that Hui Yue would use them to build an army for himself or maybe even give them to members of the families he had connections with. </span></p><br><p><span style="">They wanted these pills more than anything, yet at the same time they did not want anyone else to gain these pills, and soon due to this a large group of people felt enmity towards Hui Yue. This pill was the most outstanding medicine they had ever seen before, but with it, a river of blood would flow. It was fortunate that the pill from the contest had already been used because otherwise, no one would be able to decide what to do with such a pill. Even the grandmasters would stoop to stealing when it came to something like this. If they could, they would be able to understand quite a lot from examining the pill. Even if they could not figure out a way to copy the formula they would at least be able to make pills that increased one&#x2019;s cultivation base or pills that allowed cultivators to jump one or two ranks. </span></p><br><p><span style="">At first, only a few people went to Hui Yue&apos;s mansion in the hopes of getting an audience with the master alchemist, but the guards would only say that Hui Yue was current not present and that they could not do anything. Still, no one left, everyone stayed and waited for the master of the mansion to return. As they waited more and more people appeared to see Hui Yue.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Two days later Hui Yue finished cultivating, and when he opened his eyes, a smile appeared on his lips. Leaving the mansion, he went outside to meet his audience. Standing on the stairs, he looked out at the two hundred cultivators who had been stubborn enough to wait for him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Good day everyone, I apologize for not meeting you all earlier. Creating the Silvermoon&apos;s Pill took a great toll on my body, and I needed to heal.&quot; He began, and his words caused the mad experts to lose most of their anger. What he said made perfect sense, and the experts felt slightly guilty for having cursed at him these past few days. It was only natural that something as outstanding as this pill had a high cost to create it.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I am sure you are all here for the Silvermoon&apos;s Pill, and I would gladly craft these pills for all of you.&quot; Hui Yue continued, and his words caused everyone to be deeply shocked. Everyone was stunned into silence by his words. They had all expected that he would adamantly decline to make any more of the pills and they had come prepared with arguments to persuade him, yet now he said that he would gladly concoct them. </span></p><br><p><span style="">While some families were ecstatic, others narrowed their eyes. They were unable to believe him and waited for what he would want in return.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I will gladly craft this pill for you. However, I do not have any more of the materials.&quot; Hui Yue continued, &quot;I had enough to create three pills. While the first two were given to my wonderful children, the final one was created for the annual alchemist&#x2019;s contest. If you wish for me to concoct this pill for you, then you have to get your hands on the ingredients needed.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing this, some of the experts were relieved. Finding herbs was a tedious task, but it was still possible. Even the rarest of herbs would be found from time to time, and Hui Yue had just said that as long as someone managed to get the ingredients then he would create the pill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;The herbs I need can be found within these memory stones.&quot; Hui Yue said as he traded out one memory stone after another. More and more blue lights shone in front of Hui Yue&apos;s mansion, and frowns appeared on the faces of the experts. The majority of the herbs were some they had never heard about or even seen before while some of them were known to be incredibly rare.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue had added some herbs from the grave alongside some ultra rare herbs. This way Hui Yue would not lose out even if he had to create a few Silvermoon&apos;s Pills.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Everyone, having seen the pills rushed away from the mansion and began to search high and low for the various herbs. It only took a few moments before the entire city knew which kind of herbs it was that Hui Yue needed to create a Silvermoon&apos;s Pill. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The Black Market Auction House and the Alchemist Guild found that their stockpiles were once more emptied of certain herbs. Afterwards, when they found out that these herbs were needed for Silvermoon&apos;s Pill, all of them felt cheated for not requesting an even higher price for the precious herbs.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;These herbs must originate from Shenyuan!&quot; Someone came to this conclusion and soon groups of mercenaries and families alike headed towards the dangerous lands, hoping to return with herbs that they could sell for a fortune.</span></p><br><p><span style="">While the city was in turmoil, Hui Yue was calmly waiting for Sha Yun to return. He cultivated, spent time concocting medicinal pills, and creating various things such as weapons, inscriptions, and runes which increased his Metal affinity. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Lao and Jo went back to attend the Royal Academy after the annual pill auction ended, but they were told that they could no longer attend. The headmaster said that their cultivation was not due to their own efforts, and therefore they were no longer members of his academy.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing this, Lao snorted. He had proven his ability before he consumed the pill, and although the pill was the reason for their rapid improvement, it had required quite a lot of them to breakthrough. Even so, neither Lao nor Jo minded too much and without saying anything the two turned around returning home. At the mansion, they started cultivating together. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Many of the herbs from the grave had been taken by Hui Yue, but he had not been able to get all of them, and suddenly the herbs from the tomb started to emerge. They were always sold at the Black Market Auction House, and their prices would easily soar to two spirit coins or more, an outstanding amount for a single herb.</span></p><br><p><span style="">It had taken three weeks before the first person appeared in front of Hui Yue&apos;s mansion with a shaking heart and hopeful eyes. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I am the patriarch of the Zhou family, please let me inside. I have brought with me the materials requested to make a Silvermoon&apos;s Pill, alongside a reward to master Hui Yue as thanks for his help. If you concoct me the pill then I, Zhou Wang, owe master Hui Yue a favor.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">His voice reverberated through the many mansions and Hui Yue instantly heard it, alongside the entire city. Everyone waited curiously to see whether or not Hui Yue would keep his word and create the pill. </span></p><br><p><span style="">A soon as the words had been spoken the gate opened and Hui Yue appeared in front of them. &quot;Please come inside.&quot; He said and gestured for the Zhou Patriarch to follow him.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Your gift is truly extravagant.&quot; Hui Yue said shocked as he saw that it was a purse with ten spirit coins. Although this amount of money was not too outstanding, it was still a lot considering this expert would owe Hui Yue a favor. To be honest, Hui Yue did not care about the coins, but he did care about the favor. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Clapping his hands, servants appeared and together the two experts moved to the library. &quot;It will take me a full seven to nine hours to refine the pill. During that time, I cannot be interrupted. You are welcome to stay in the library until I have finished or come back in nine or so hours.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;I&#x2019;ll wait in the library. I look forward to seeing you in a few hours.&quot; The patriarch said with a nod. He was truly very worried. Although Hui Yue had managed to create the pill before there was always a chance that he would fail in concocting the pill, and if even the slightest interruption occurred, all the materials would be wasted.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Although it was easy to say that it had gone wrong, Hui Yue put his full effort into creating Silvermoon&apos;s Pill for the Zhou Patriarch. The favor was what he truly wanted, and thus he had to create the pill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hour after hour passed and while Hui Yue was focused on refining and merging medicinal pastes and energies, the Zhou family patriarch, who had intended to read some books, found himself too nervous to really focus on reading or cultivating.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Time flew by for Hui Yue as he refined while time crept by at a snail&#x2019;s pace for the Zhou Patriarch. Soon seven hours had passed. Then eight hours went by, and finally as the ninth hour came to an end, Hui Yue reentered the library with a jade bottle in his hands.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Staring at the bottle, the patriarch felt his mouth dry out as he tried to ask if he had succeeded, but all he managed was a squeak. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Don&apos;t worry master Zhou.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile as he gave the jade vial to Zhou Wang who quickly opened it. Within was a glistening pill and a very heavy scent wafted out. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Thank you. Thank you so much Master Hui!&quot; The Zhou Patriarch said while truly shocked and elated. The pill had been a success, and he was now capable of returning home in high spirits. He had not wasted their materials nor had he been tricked by this young man.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;My pleasure.&quot; Hui Yue smiled. He had gained a favor from one of the most outstanding families within Muchuan City while also gaining some very rare herbs he was currently unable to obtain. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The Zhou Patriarch looked at Hui Yue with gratitude in his eyes. &quot;Should we get the materials for another pill then we will trouble you once again.&quot; He said with a nod before he left the mansion.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The word quickly spread through town that Hui Yue had crafted Silvermoon&apos;s Pill for the Zhou family. Now everyone truly knew that Hui Yue really would make the pills as long as the materials were provided. This made a second uproar appear as the ones who had hesitated to gather the herbs suddenly understood that they needed to work hard to catch up with the other families because everyone wanted Silvermoon&apos;s Pill.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue did not mind this too much. Instead, he just kept training and waiting. As one day took another, he had successfully concocted three Silvermoon&#x2019;s Pills and the month had finally passed by. It was now time for Sha Yun to return and hope was evident in Hui Yue&apos;s eyes, hope, and anticipation. He could not wait for his friends to be together again. It had been far too long, and he would now finally have the chance to once again see his good friend. As for what the Frozen General wanted, Hui Yue had no idea but was slightly worried. The Frozen General was not someone Hui Yue could take lightly and therefore he spent all his time training his mind and his body. &#xA0;</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
