They had feared that there would be many more trials, but considering how many had failed every single trial so far, it was understandable that it would not take too long before the victor was decided.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The group all returned to their own courtyards and started training. Although they had spent the first many days leisurely around the city, they now felt pressured. The trials were going to end soon, and they all wished to become the new judge.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The courtyards were now very quiet. Not only was everyone training, but only a few experts managed to pass the trial that had been prepared here in the first Court of Hell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Considering the difficulties of the first court&apos;s trials, everyone could imagine just how difficult the trials in the next court would be.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I almost wish that it was a tournament. If we were fighting, then I have faith in my own abilities. No Immortals of Creation are left, and I would be able to defeat the other contestants if I used all I had.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue mumbled to himself, but far away, in the palace, Yanluo was sitting with closed eyes, and suddenly a smile appeared on his lips. &quot;A tournament, huh?&quot; He mumbled to himself and then nodded his head. &quot;A tournament it shall be! But I don&apos;t want to lose this talent so let&#x2019;s give him a helping hand. If he cannot win the tournament even with this, then he is not worthy of becoming the new Judge of Hell!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">King Qinguang was seated not far from him and nodded his head, &quot;Why don&apos;t you just choose him already?&quot; He asked confused. If he were Yanluo, he would have already have made the decision. Although everyone left was indeed very talented, none of them were as promising as Hui Yue. For them, the most interesting individual was Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue, unaware of the fact that Yanluo was watching him, took out the glass orb that he had gotten from Pei Tian, and after hesitated for a moment he poured his Ancestral Worldpower into it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It did not take long before the misty orb turned into the image of a man. A man he had seen before. This was Pei Tian, and he was smiling broadly as he looked at Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The news about your unmeasurable talent has already spread from Pei Ze. He recorded the memory and traded it to the head elders who instantly sent it to the highest echelons of the sect.&quot; Pei Tian said proudly as he looked at Hui Yue who just smiled sheepishly and scratched the back of his head unsure of what to say.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearing his throat, he finally started speaking about why he had called. &quot;During this trial, I have spent more and more time interacting with my bloodline.&quot; Hui Yue said slowly, &quot;and the more I connected with it, the more I have remembered.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I remember a village filled with my brothers and sisters, my mother and aunts,&quot; he said honestly as he spoke of the memories he had relived. He named some of his brothers and sisters alongside some of the aunts and his mother.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I remember how I was always a child chasing my dreams. Back then, I was certain that I was a peerless talent, but it turned out to be nothing more than average. I remember how I joined the department that dealt with gathering and spreading the news, and I even remember the missions that went south resulting in my death.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue paused for a moment and shook his head. His face looked regretful as he sighed deeply. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why I can even remember these things; I have no idea what happened to me, but those memories are as clear as the ones for my own life. I figured I should ask you whether or not they are fake.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Tian was quiet as tears slowly streamed down his face, and with trembling hands, he said, &quot;My son! You are truly my son!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Wait there!&quot; He ordered Hui Yue before he took the orb and rushed from his mountain towards the patriarch&apos;s palace.</p><p dir="ltr">As he reached it, he did not pay any heed to the guards or maids, nor even to the experts from his family, he rushed right past them into the chamber where his older brother was seated looking over some papers.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What is the matter?&quot; The patriarch asked surprised as he saw Pei Tian rush in with a manic smile on his face and tears streaming down it. He was quite taken aback at this sight as it had been centuries since his brother had last showed so much emotion.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Listen to what Pei Yue has to say! Listen to every single word he says!&quot; He exclaimed, looking rather insane at that moment, and the patriarch put down the papers in his hands and focused on the orb.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing, Hui Yue repeated every word he had already told Pei Tian, and even the face of the patriarch turned rather shocked.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The patriarch had already heard and seen, the memory that Pei Ze had sent their way of him exploding the orb measuring one&apos;s talent and they had already felt that Hui Yue was an important member of their family, but he was not born into the family, would he truly be loyal?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Though things were different now, he truly was a child of the Celestial Sword Sect! Relief flooded the body of the patriarch, and he raised his arm giving his brother a deep hug.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your son was missing for so many years, yet now he has returned to us as a genius!&quot; He exclaimed excitedly. &quot;Let&#x2019;s announce that he is your son. As soon as everyone hears this even more people will approve of him, but we can keep quiet about his real heritage. Let them all believe you went out and had a bastard if they wish; I don&apos;t care. Announcing that you had a child is the best protection we can give him in the sect.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue said nothing. He had promised the memory that he would look after Pei Tian and treat him with the fidelity of a son.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The conversation between the three of them quickly ended, and before long the news of Hui Yue being the son of Pei Tian spread across the entire Celestial Sword Sect and even outside of its borders.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Those who had failed to believe that he truly was a third generation disciple were all shocked when Pei Tian admitted to being his father. Many felt that it was because of him that Hui Yue had avoided being slain for the rules he broke. The rules were made by the strong, and only people powerful enough were allowed to break these rules. Knowing that Pei Tian was his father, everything made much more sense.</p><p dir="ltr">Soon the rumor about him shattering an assessment orb also spread amongst the Celestial Sword Sect members, but many failed to believe it, and they were sure it was greatly exaggerated. That was until the memory imprint was shown, and it was then people realized how truly monstrous Hui Yue really was as everyone knew that a memory imprint could not be faked.</p><p dir="ltr">All those members of the sect which looked down upon Hui Yue started to look at him in a new light. Being able to produce one miracle after another, they understood that perhaps this young man was the true top expert of the younger generation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He soon managed to get a cult-like following, and many of the younger girls started giggling every time his name was mentioned.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These rumors also spread outside the Celestial Sword Sect to the other major sects, but no one apart from Nightcrawler Sect believed that he actually shattered the assessment orb.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">They had heard about it from their own participant, and they understood that the Celestial Sword Sect was on the rise, therefore, they planned to increase their connection with one another.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Nightcrawler Sect was only ranked second to Diyu, but they understood that this was likely to change with Hui Yue&apos;s appearance. Although they were unhappy with the fact that he was not from their own sect, they would not even consider touching this talented youth.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Back in the First Court of Hell, Hui Yue had entered his meditation room. He spent the following three days fully focused on the celestial wings and the bloodline power they gave him. He could feel multiple daos of the winds pressing on his mind, and all of them were much easier to comprehend now he had unlocked his bloodline.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I wonder if I should try and comprehend a new dao,&quot; he mused to himself as he felt the wind all around him. &quot;I have already comprehended the dao of devouring, the dao of the sword, the dao of gravity, and the dao of the inferno. Not to mention I can freely use Lan Feng&apos;s daos of ignition and flame. In total, this brings me up to six daos. Not many Gods have control over so many daos.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The problem is that all my daos are in different categories. If I focus on the daos of wind, I will still have to comprehend all the minor daos related to the wind before I can attempt to merge them and comprehend the major dao of wind.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Still, I feel that if I try to comprehend the minor daos of fire, it will take me an even longer time. Although my speed at comprehending the fire related daos is not bad, due to the bloodline of the Vermilion Bird flowing in my veins, it is nothing compared to the bloodline of the great roc. My roc bloodline is many times denser, and thus my results will be all the more shocking.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well really, I don&#x2019;t need to learn more daos right now. I could just try to perfect those Ancestral Worldpower Skills that I learned from when I merged with my past memories.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Although they are ordinary skills they might prove handy from time to time. Especially the Forbidden Rush of the Great Roc seemed to be quite the outstanding ability.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pondering for some time, Hui Yue could not make a decision about what skills to train for now. He knew that for the past few months he had been advancing quickly and that his strength had soared greatly, but he did need to take the time to solidify his advances and focus on what he had learned or his foundation would not be stable moving forward.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Life is much harder when Huli is not by my side to help me determine what to do,&quot; he mumbled to himself, but then he shook his head. &quot;I will get nowhere by complaining about this. For now, I think I should get used to using the dao of gravity for fighting alongside perfecting the use of my new Ancestral Worldpower Skills.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue slowly nodded his head, and he started practicing. The dao of gravity was able to be used in many ways, and he soon found that it required rather accurate control over this dao to be able to make full use of its various abilities on the battlefield.</p><p dir="ltr">This dao could be used as a supportive dao which would slow down the opponent by constantly changing gravity around them, and it could also be used to instantly crush those weaker than him if he focused on it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">There were unlimited possibilities when attacking with this dao, and Hui Yue felt excited that the more time he spent on trying to understand it, the more new ways he discovered to attack with the dao.</p><p dir="ltr">A smile appeared on his lips as he sat down in the middle of the room satisfied. As he sat down, he felt an enormous pressure pushing down on his entire being, and he knew that if anyone tried to come close to him, even if it were an Immortal of Creation, then their speed would slow down quite a bit.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
