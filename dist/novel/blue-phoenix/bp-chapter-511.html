Seeing Wan Qiao, a small smile also formed on his face.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I heard about your loss,&quot; Wan Qiao continued with a sigh. &quot;My condolences.&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Seeing that you were able to fight against Rong Liang I guess you have stepped into the God rank.&quot; Wan Qiao continued to speak, and as she talked about the God rank, her eyes shone with longing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue nodded his head and entered the room closing the door behind him. &quot;I did indeed become a God,&quot; he said, but the pride and arrogance which once followed this sentence was no longer there. Being a God was no good if you were not strong enough to save the ones you loved.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have been traveling through the galaxy and have reached the Netherworld,&quot; Hui Yue continued. &quot;While traveling, I took the Divine Beast World with me. Now that I am the Crowned Sovereign of this world, I will never allow it to suffer under a careless leader again. An He never did this wonderful world justice. I will nurture it and care for it, not only because of the Vermilion Bird or Lan Feng but also because the Divine Beast World is my home.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;But to fight An He I need allies,&quot; Hui Yue continued as he looked at the ceiling. &quot;I need Gods by my side who will help me take care of An He&apos;s supporters. Also traveling in a group will be the most beneficial way to adventure through the many different worlds. The more allies we have, the safer it will be.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Right now I have nine Gods by my side, and all of them are second generation beasts. I am sure they have come to visit Shenyuan as well,&quot; Hui Yue commented, and Wan Qiao nodded her head. She knew about these beasts Gods who had appeared out of nowhere and shook the world of the Saints.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I want you to follow us as well,&quot; Hui Yue said straightforwardly. &quot;I am in control of the Formation of Life, and although it is occupied right now, in a few years, it will be free. At that time, I will want you to enter it and become a God. After which I want you to follow me on our trip through the galaxy to get rid of An He.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are already a very strong Saint. Everything within this world you have experienced, everything there is to see you have seen. Why not join me to see the galaxy? You will see things you have never dreamed of, experience new worlds, and do things that you never thought possible.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did what he could to convince her, and slowly a smile spread on her face.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She knew about Gods. She had lived for thousands of years and had even been Lan Feng&apos;s teacher. She was not a second generation beast, but she had lived amongst the Divine Beasts and the second generation beasts. She had always dreamed of becoming a God, but no matter how much she tried, it had been impossible for her to overcome the final bottleneck and become a God ranked cultivator. The last thousand years her strength had not risen at all.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Wan Qiao was unaware what this Formation of Life was, she understood that it was something that could assist her in becoming a God, and for that she was grateful.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Wan Qiao was loyal to the four divine beast Gods. She had seen the world change from a place where beasts and humans shared the land, a world where there was no discrimination, to a world where beasts had to shelter themselves within Shenyuan. They had to hide in Shenyuan and not allow the humans to enter for fear of being slain or taken as slaves.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Wan Qiao had lived through the era where the world went from belonging to the beasts and humans alike to belonging primarily to the humans. This had been a hellish time for all beasts, especially the ones who could take human shape or the ones with high intelligence as they had been hunted down to be made into slaves by greedy humans.</p><p dir="ltr">Wan Qiao felt that all of this was An He&apos;s fault, and although she did not feel as if he was her mortal enemy, she would not mind helping Hui Yue and Lan Feng getting their revenge.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&#x201C;Okay,&#x201D; She said with a nod of her head, &#x201C;Count me in, I&#x2019;ll become your support, and if I cannot be your support, I will be your shield. If you allow me to leave this world and experience something new I will forever be grateful towards you!&#x201D;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing Wan Qiao agreeing, Hui Yue felt relief, but he had other pressuring questions and quickly asked them.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I have been looking for Li Xiaopeng and Xu Piao for quite some time,&quot; Hui Yue casually said as he looked at Wan Qiao, but the woman shook her head. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know who Xu Piao is, and the last time I saw Li Xiaopeng you were with me. He seems to have vanished; I looked for him as well a few years back.&quot; She sighed, surprising Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You looked for Li Xiaopeng? What did you need with him?&quot; He asked confused, but Wan Qiao&apos;s face turned slightly red as she answered, &quot;nothing specifically, it&#x2019;s just that I can&apos;t forget the fight we had in Siban. He fought me head on, and neither of us could gain the upper hand. It was such a strange sensation and I wished to fight him once more. Unfortunately, I cannot find him.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">A slim smile appeared on Hui Yue&apos;s face as he looked at Wan Qiao and he nodded his head, &quot;I see.&quot; He said, not asking for further details.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking around, Hui Yue sighed. &quot;I need to go,&quot; he said decisively. &quot;I just came to give you the offer. Think about it. The next couple of years, before it is your turn to enter the Formation of Life, get ready to leave this world. You will be traveling with me instead of returning to Shenyuan again.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Having said this, Hui Yue vanished from the face of the Divine Beast World and appeared in the Universe Box&#x2019;s space.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He now had two choices; one was to wander the space to see if he could find some treasures he had never seen before, or he could head back to the inn in Skydragon Fortress.</p><p dir="ltr">The last option was the one Hui Yue picked. He quickly left the safety of the Universe Box and entered the room in their inn once more. Upon arriving he saw that Huli was seated right by his side, her entire body rigid. Her eyes were alert, and she was extremely vigilant.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">She had done her duty well and spent the entire day watching over the room. Although it was not likely that anyone would disturb them, the chance was still there, and Huli had made sure that there was no danger for Hui Yue to return to.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hui Yue said as he gently petted Huli&apos;s head. He then sat on top of the bed and closed his eyes as he focused on the dao of inferno.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue had quickly grasped and understood the dao of devouring. He had been in contact with this dao for years already, and therefore he had gained many insights into it. He understood the different aspects of devouring exactly because he had experienced it in his other lives.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Because of this, he managed to fully comprehend the dao of devouring, but the dao of inferno was another matter entirely.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had touched upon various parts of the dao of fire while working with Lan Feng&apos;s blue flames alongside the flames of his elemental affinity, but this was just the mere basics of the dao of fire.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was, however, impossible to embark upon a major dao just like that. One needed to understand the minor daos to understand how a major dao worked. While Hui Yue was in the red realm, his Ancestral Worldpower was infused with what he believed was the affinity of fire, but it turned out to really be the dao of inferno.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As he meditated on the dao of inferno, Hui Yue found that it was a very domineering and powerful dao. It was explosive in power and filled with destruction. Inferno was not like fire. Inferno was the part of fire which was out of control; the part which could not be handled unless one had an unwavering will.</p><p dir="ltr">The dao of inferno was chaotic, and it made Hui Yue&apos;s mind chaotic. It was feeding on his emotions, his rage, his sadness, and it made the eternal flame within him burn uncontrollably. It made Hui Yue&apos;s entire Ancestral Worldpower turn into a flame of destruction!</p><p dir="ltr">Huli was seated by his side, and occasionally she would casually raise her hand. Ancestral Worldpower would rush out from her hand and form a protective barrier around Hui Yue that blocked all the fire from leaving his body. This ensured that he did not burn his clothes, the bed, or anything else.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As time went by, Huli needed to raise her hand and create a new barrier for Hui Yue more, and more often as the energy within him was becoming more and more chaotic. Although one might consider this a terrible thing, it was actually beneficial for Hui Yue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">What he was trying to comprehend was a chaotic, uncontrollable force. It was only natural that the path to understanding was also filled with chaotic, terrible energies. This was also one of the reasons that not many experts would cultivate in the middle of a city but chose to find a secluded location away from others.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When they were cultivating their bodies would become one with the dao, and thus their bodies would take on the same aspects as the dao they were training in. Most of these daos were all quite destructive in their own ways, and therefore they needed to be either protected by someone or in seclusion or special chambers made for training.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was entirely focused on the insights he was having into the dao that he did not notice his body had turned into one massive flame. Nor did he notice the cooling cloak of Ancestral Worldpower which Huli placed on him; all he felt was the fact that his understanding of the dao was increasing at a rapid pace.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This state of enlightenment lasted for a full three days before Hui Yue opened his eyes and his body returned to its natural state. His eyes seemed to flash with a red flame for a short while before they turned back to their usual blue.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Yue,&quot; Huli called out, and Hui Yue turned to look at her. His gaze was now much sharper than before, and his entire aura was becoming much more stable and his strength was constantly increasing.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We missed the auction of Treasure Mountain last time,&quot; Huli said excitedly. &quot;Why don&apos;t we go to the auction this week? There might be some things that can help you improve your cultivation, and we will have a chance of seeing some of the other experts that have appeared in this Skydragon Fortress.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue contemplated for some time. He was not too willing to give up time he could use to cultivate, but if he found some precious materials which made it possible for him to increase his cultivation, then it would be worth going. Not only this, but it was also important to see what he was up against in these upcoming trials.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having thought of the pros and cons, Hui Yue finally nodded his head and leaned back on the bed. He felt incredibly exhausted from having cultivated nonstop for three days. His mind had been strained to the limits from comprehending the dao of inferno. Now he needed to rest, and slowly slipped into a dream world.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
