His knowledge about pills was near infinite, but he had not been taught about the Pill of Samsara by his master.</p><p>It was an ancient pill. Since the Alchemist God had not taught Hui Yue how to create it, it was clear that there was some sort of dark method attached to its creation.</p><p>The Alchemist God was a righteous cultivator who stayed true to his heart. He walked the path of righteousness and would only create pills that were of benefit to an expert, without too serious of side effects. He was an alchemist who did not use sinister and evil methods to forge medicinal pills.</p><p>Since he had not been taught about the medicinal pill, it was clear that it was a sinister one.</p><p>Reminding himself to ask the Alchemist God if they came out of this battle, about the pill, Hui Yue pushed away the thought of it and returned to tranquility. He would need to have a clear head if he wished to survive this massive attack that had been planned for them.</p><p>The Blood Demons were bursting with killing intent. Before they had all wanted to kill Hui Yue and his companions as a duty, but now, after hearing of the rewards, they all wished to be the one that dealt the killing blow and had gone mad over it.</p><p>&quot;Look at them, they take us as being easy to cut down,&quot; Lan Feng said while laughing. &quot;Although they are many, we all know that quality comes before quantity. Although they have more supreme experts, I wonder just how supreme they are in the face of absolute strength.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue said nothing but tightened his grasp around the Celestial Sword. He could feel how the natural energies were starting to revolve around him.</p><p>He could feel how the dao was becoming increasingly clear and his body increasingly light. This sword was truly marvelous, but it was only him who had such an outstanding weapon. The one Pei Ziqi used was a grade below his, and the spear that Wei used was even further down the line of quality weapons.</p><p>Lan Feng used no weapon, but he held nothing back either. He started to transform, and within seconds, a massive blue phoenix soared in the void above them.</p><p>The phoenix was at least as large as an airplane from Hui Yue&apos;s past life. Lan Feng&#x2019;s body was enormous, and his eyes were filled with terrifying, blazing blue flames.</p><p>Although Lan Feng was a phoenix, he had given up his nirvana phoenix flame, the ability to be rebirthed. If he perished here, then it would be a true end for him, but he was not willing to accept such an outcome. He shot forward, heading straight for the supreme Blood Demons with a phoenix cry that shook the void around them.</p><p>Lan Feng had been given a refined body. This body had been personally refined by the Alchemist God, and it was in no way inferior to any other body in the galaxy; in fact, it was a notch above them all.</p><p>The Blood Demons were born at the peak of their power, but even so, none of them had sturdy bodies. Their bodies were as average as human cultivators because their race had been molded with humans as a base.</p><p>It was possible to create a stronger body and enter this body, but not many of them were capable of doing so. To create a strong body one needed strength similar to Yanluo. Although any God of Creation could create a body, it was not the same as getting a sturdy body that was better than what they were born with.</p><p>Many Gods of Creation would only create a new body for themselves in case that their old one had been completely destroyed and all hope of recreating it had failed.</p><p>Seeing Lan Feng rush towards them, these demons snorted. They were not aware of the fact that they had refined bodies, but even if they were, they would never take such a thing seriously.</p><p>Refined bodies were the stuff of legends. They were famed for their toughness and strength, and known as the most durable and powerful bodies in the galaxy, but what idiot would actually believe such a stupid thing?</p><p>However, as they say seeing is believing, and when Lan Feng collided into the front row of supreme experts, his bodily strength alone was enough to knock them all flying backwards.</p><p>It has to be said that none of them were using martial arts, daos, or any other kind of attack, but they all felt their blood rush through their bodies and one of them even had blood leaking out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>They all stared in horror at Lan Feng, but he did not give them the time to compose themselves. Wisps of flame appeared all over his body, and all these flames were blue in color.</p><p>They shot out at the speed of sound, and no matter how fast these supreme experts were, it was simply impossible for them to retreat.</p><p>Since retreat was impossible, they all reached out for the daos they had comprehended, and suddenly the fluctuations of the energy in the surrounding area became very chaotic.</p><p>&quot;Help Lan Feng!&quot; Hui Yue yelled out as he too charged forward. Wings appeared on the back of his body, and his speed rose drastically. The Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s wings were in no way ordinary; they were the wings of the Great Roc, a divine beast, and the bloodline of the Great Roc let Hui Yue understand the dao of wind to an outstanding degree. With the Celestial Sword in hand, it was not farfetched to say that in the entire galaxy only one or two old monsters had a better affinity with the dao of wind than Hui Yue at this moment.</p><p>Light, darkness, wind, earth, fire, water, and metal started to twist and churn the space. So many dao attacks were produced that space itself could not hold and Hui Yue grit his teeth. To face the dao attacks of over a million opponents was something that caused heavy pressure to be applied to his body, but he still kept his back straight and his eyes wide open. With his sword in hand, he sent out his formation of the Ten Suns.</p><p>These Ten Suns were the hottest suns in the galaxy. They had previously caused havoc to the entire galaxy, but now they had been turned into a formation.</p><p>Previously, Hui Yue did not have the capability to display the full strength of the formation, but after breaking through the thousand seal boundary, he had a newfound strength that could rival one with four daos!</p><p>These ten suns all formed a battle array before they flew into the mass of Blood Demons, killing hundreds of them at a time. Everywhere they went, the scent of charred meat and blood pervaded.</p><p>While Hui Yue&apos;s formation was floating back and forth through the massive demon army, Hui Yue did not pay much attention to it. Instead, he focused most of his soulforce and attention on the supreme experts. Although he had comprehended the dao of wind, darkness, earth, and fire, he still was quite hesitant. There was also an expert on the opposing side who had comprehended four daos.</p><p>&quot;Leave him to me,&quot; Hui Yue said as he pointed at the Blood Demon with the tip of the Celestial Sword.</p><p>&quot;You deal with him, I&apos;ll deal with these small minions,&quot; Lan Feng laughed as he was dealing with five experts that had comprehended three major daos each. Although it was only one dao less than Hui Yue and Lan Feng, this one dao was a qualitative leap in strength, a void as vast as the high heavens to cultivators. Lan Feng was solely able to deal with five of these experts, and he did so with ease!</p><p>At the same time, Pei Ziqi and Wei were dealing with four experts together, two each.</p><p>Pei Ziqi was holding the upper hand against her two opponents, but she did not do so with the same amount of ease as Lan Feng could.</p><p>Wei was struggling. Although he was strong, he had only comprehended two daos. To compete against two experts that had comprehended more daos than him was already a suicidal mission, but Wei had lived for a very long time. He had been tempered in constant battles, and his understanding of the daos he had comprehended was far superior to the daos of these demons.</p><p>Some Blood Demons would focus all their attention to fully understand the daos they had comprehended. They would become true monsters that could not be defeated even by someone with even a whole dao more than them, while other demons thought that focusing on the daos were a waste. They would never be able to improve on the daos they had comprehended, and thus they went all out on increasing their Ancestral Worldpower pool.</p><p>The two opponents of Wei were exactly such experts. They felt that they understood their daos well enough and had then turned their focus to absorbing Ancestral Worldpower in the hopes that they could break through relying on that.</p><p>Hui Yue faced off against the four dao expert. Both of them had comprehended four daos, but Hui Yue had the benefit of the Celestial Sword making his daos increasingly profound.</p><p>The dao of wind merged with the wings on his back, and as a result, he was the wind. Every step he took covered kilometers and his speed could only be said to be terrifyingly fast.</p><p>Reaching the point of being able to merge with the wind and appear anywhere the wind was within a certain distance. Hui Yue was filled with excitement. It had been a long time since he last had a proper opponent.</p><p>Hui Yue reached out, and whirlpools appeared around him. The dao of wind, fire, earth, and darkness all started to twist and churn; the energy in the area became chaotic and soon something that shocked any onlookers occurred. Hui Yue&#x2019;s daos started to superimpose on one another, laying themselves like small waves of dao on top of each other, compressed to their strongest form.</p><p>Hui Yue wrapped these thin layers of dao around his sword tip, and the sword started shining with an intense light.</p><p>Chopping out with this sword, space itself shattered and space rifts appeared in the void. If one were to touch such spatial rifts, they would instantly lose anything that came into contact with it. Although it would be possible to, later on, recreate their body, it would be a severe wound, especially in a battle like this one.</p><p>The Blood Demon&apos;s face turned grim as he saw the daos laying themselves like layers upon his sword, and he withdrew instantly. He was an expert that had understood the many layers of the daos he comprehended, and he was sure that he could jump ranks and defeat a God who had comprehended five major daos, however, right now he was scared silly by the use of Hui Yue&apos;s daos.</p><p>Hui Yue was willing to use anything at his disposal to win this battle. He had already taken out the Celestial Sword, and thus he was not willing to hold anything back.</p><p>While his eyes turned cold and merciless the ten suns continued to wreak havoc amongst the lower-ranked demons. These lower demons were not just waiting for things to settle between the major demons, they were constantly sending more and more of their dao attacks at Hui Yue.</p><p>Since he had superimposed four daos on top of each other, these daos were much stronger than the normal dao. Every attack that landed around him was instantly shattered and turned into nothingness.</p><p>The daos attacks of fire, earth, darkness, and wind even worked to strengthen his own dao tremendously.</p><p>&quot;If it is this strong just superimposing the daos... I wonder what would happen if I were to merge the various daos,&quot; Hui Yue muttered to himself. &quot;Is it even possible to merge daos?&quot; he could not help but wonder, however, as the thought sprouted in his mind it grew roots, and he was filled with excitement towards such a notion.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
