His senses were sealed the whole time, and he had been completely focused on comprehending the dao of the sword.</p><p dir="ltr">Even after Hui Yue woke, he still did not notice Huli as he instantly started attacking with his sword. He was entranced with the dao as he felt himself merge with his sword and became one with it.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Nearby, Huli was happy to see that he was so focused on the dao of the sword. With his speed, he should be able to make considerable progress in these four and a half years.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Hui Yue seemed to be immersed in his training, he suddenly stopped. A frown appeared on his face, and he waved his hand so that his sword vanished into the Universe Box.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment he stopped training he sensed Huli and his eyes shone with excitement. &quot;Cai Jie has succeeded!&quot; He exclaimed with a smile on his face, and Huli also sent him a smile in return. Having more Gods on his side was without a doubt of great benefit.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We need to find Deng Wu,&quot; Hui Yue continued. &quot;The next person to become a God should be him. As soon as he has prepared, we will go and release Cai Jie from the underground prison where we placed the Formation of Life and let Deng Wu inside.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Standing still for a moment and sensing the world around him, Hui Yue could not help but nod his head approvingly, &quot;I can feel how the essence of the heavens and the earth within this world is increasing by the day. Experts who have been stuck at bottlenecks are breaking through one after another. These new experts are all considered geniuses due to their training speed, and peerless geniuses are no longer as peerless as they were before.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are going to stay here for the next four years and train. The last half year I will need to locate and gather all the beast Gods. Although I promised them ten years to wander the world, things have changed. When we return to the Netherworld, I am going to need a small army of my own in case we need to use force to leave the City Lord&apos;s mansion. It was not the most hospitable place to enter the Universe Box, but in the end, I had no other option. My d*mned previous life won&apos;t help when I need it; it only seems to react when you need to be defended,&quot; Hui Yue said to Huli with a sigh.</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this Huli could not help but giggle slightly. The person she had known back then was indeed very apathetic. He was a master when it came to the dao, but when it came to the social aspects of life, he lacked quite a bit as he simply did not care about anyone. It was no surprise that he was completely uncaring about his current life.</p><p dir="ltr">Shaking his head with a slight smile, Hui Yue stretched his exhausted body. He had not rested for a full two weeks. Although his body had been sitting still while he was comprehending the dao, his mind had been constantly working.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Having stretched for a short while, Hui Yue entered the mansion and went to his room where he took a bath and changed clothes. He was in no particular hurry to get Deng Wu and pick up Cai Jie. Although Cai Jie had already successfully broken into the God rank, staying in the Formation of Life for a day or two extra was not in any way a detrimental thing. In fact, it was quite beneficial to stabilize one&#x2019;s foundation. Especially for someone like Cai Jie who had instantly jumped to the God of Creation rank.</p><p dir="ltr">Having changed his clothes, Hui Yue went to the library where Deng Wu and Rong Xing spent the majority of their time. As he reached it, he smiled gently as he saw his two good friends sitting together. Deng Wu was sitting with a book in his hands and reading while Rong Xing was sitting by his side silently cultivating.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Deng Wu could cultivate further, he was already a Saint, and he knew that the speed of which he cultivated would be many times quicker as soon as he entered the Formation of Life. Therefore he did not spend time cultivating, instead, he was reading through every old book he could find about the history of the world. He was sure that there were clues left behind about An He&apos;s life and powers, he just had to piece them together. But even after searching for quite a long time he had still not found a lot of information on the subject.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Deng Wu, it is time for you to enter the Formation of Life,&quot; Hui Yue said quietly, and although Deng Wu looked at Rong Xing with longing, he quickly nodded his head. Although he wished to stay here with Rong Xing and keep her company, he knew that he needed to be much stronger if he wanted to protect her in the world they were going to enter soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Thinking this, he nodded his head and with a gentle kiss on Rong Xing&apos;s forehead he followed behind Hui Yue and Huli.</p><p dir="ltr">These three started their trip towards the mountain range where they had left the Formation of Life. The mountain range was far away and laid in a desolate place, but the distance was quickly traversed for a God. Huli, who was the strongest of them, cloaked Deng Wu in her Ancestral Worldpower and dragged him with her so that his speed was as fast as theirs.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This is going to be quite exciting,&quot; he said breathlessly to Hui Yue and Huli who both gave him a wry smile.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It is not that simple to be a God,&quot; Hui Yue warned, &quot;I have just realized recently that when you become a God everything changes. Your attacks change and the way one cultivates changes too. It is not as simple as it might seem, but then again, I have no doubt that you will be able to breakthrough.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue said smilingly and slowly they reached the mountain where they had left the formation. Both Huli and Hui Yue possessed the power to open up this formation, and with but a wave of their hand, a loud rumble was heard as the ground trembled and the mountain slowly peeled open, revealing a large formation underground.</p><p dir="ltr">Light shone into the formation from outside and Hui Yue, who had expected that Cai Jie would need a lot longer to break into the God rank again, could not help but smile. His side had just gained an even stronger expert in their fight against An He!</p><p dir="ltr">As the mountain was completely opened, a beam of light shot out from deep within and landed right next to Hui Yue. Looking at this figure, a smile flourished on Hui Yue&apos;s face.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You succeeded! And so quickly too!&quot; He said with excitement in his voice, and Cai Jie, who was standing in front of him, nodded his head. His entire face beaming with happiness.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This strength! I have dreamed about my powers returning so many times! Although I have less Ancestral Worldpower than I had when I was last a God, I am still a God of Creation. Since it never influenced my understanding of the dao, I still have completely comprehended four minor daos.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Four daos is in no way a bad thing!&quot; Hui Yue exclaimed shocked. But Huli just shook her head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I need to tell you something,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Amongst Primordial Gods or Primordial Immortals as your rank is called, it is natural to have comprehended three or four daos.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;The reason they were considered strong in Skydragon fortress is that they were the people who had appeared on their own. Anyone who was an Immortal of Creation, or God of Creation, would have been given a direct invitation by Yanluo, himself, and they would not need to stop at Skydragon Fortress but would have gone directly to Diyu.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Anyone who has comprehended more than four daos would also have been sent directly to Diyu.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;So that means that I will be fighting someone who is even more outstanding than the experts of Skydragon Fortress?&quot; Hui Yue asked dejectedly, and Huli just nodded her head.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Don&apos;t be too sad,&quot; she continued, &quot;I don&apos;t think that you will be participating in a direct tournament. What Yanluo needs is not the strongest cultivators, but the one who has the best affinity with the souls of the dead. Although strength is needed, I can&apos;t help but feel that this trial is not as simple as many think.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this Hui Yue truly hoped that she was correct. Shaking his head, he decided to not think about it right now. &quot;For now, I will comprehend the dao of the sword. When I have completely understood this dao, I will also be someone who has comprehended three daos, and since one of these daos is the dao of devouring, I am certain that I can handle quite a few of the experts!&quot; Hui Yue mumbled to himself but as he spoke to himself Cai Jie&apos;s face turned to shock.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Three daos! Three complete daos?!&quot; He yelled in a high pitched voice. &quot;It took me a thousand years to comprehend four daos, and I was considered a genius! You have not even spent a decade, and you already comprehended three?!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Not really,&quot; Hui Yue scratched his head. &quot;I comprehended the dao of devouring because of my memories and previous lives, so that does not count. I only needed to meditate on it for a short while, and then I understood it all. Then I happened to see this strange man in space which somehow increased my speed of understanding the dao of inferno. By relying on this, I managed to comprehend my second dao.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I planned on comprehending the dao of space, but considering the difficulty and my urgent need to increasing my strength I shelved it, and now I&apos;m focusing on a very simple dao, the dao of the sword.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You&#x2019;re such a cheat,&quot; Cai Jie complained, but even so he still had a smile on his face. &quot;I wish I had my previous lives that provided me with insights into the dao. Then again we can&apos;t all be as lucky as you are. You are my brother, so your strength is my strength! I can only be happy to see you improving at such insane speeds!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Cai Jie who, at first, had seemed shocked to the core was now laughing loudly. &quot;An He just you wait! Since Yue still has a lot of lives waiting to be merged, he will become one of the most outstanding geniuses you have ever seen!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Cai Jie was ecstatic. He had feared that it would take quite a long time before they would dare seek revenge, but now he realized that because of Hui Yue&apos;s special situation it was likely not going to be too long a wait!</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Hui Yue, who understood Cai Jie&apos;s excitement, smiled slightly but he also knew that some of these lives might not be as amazing as they hoped. Although the green witch was beneficial due to her abilities with lifeforce, she had never reached the God rank and thus never understood any daos. It was possible that all the memories that he had left were the same; that they had not reached the God rank.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Hui Yue thought about the black figure with the white specks of light and a silly smile appeared on his face. He could not wait for the time when he could merge with the memory which had comprehended the dao of space.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Deep in thought, his mind entered his core and looked at the open memories. He had the memories of the wings, which the City Lord assumed was from some sect called the Celestial Sword Sect, but he also had the memories of whatever this red gem was which had been dormant most of the time. Together with the red gem was also the memory of this mysterious shining star that Hui Yue had never actually seen do anything.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Smiling, Hui Yue withdrew his mind from his core and looked at his friends, &quot;it is indeed a cheat, so why not start using this cheat properly?&quot; He said as a big grin appeared on his face.</p><br></div><p></p>
