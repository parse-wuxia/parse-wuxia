They were not stopped by any experts in the middle area, and the only time they entered a world was to seek shelter from an Ancestral Worldpower tidal wave.</p><p>They did not explore the world they had entered but stayed at the same location for a full two weeks before they exited the world again. They were certain that by then the tidal wave should have passed.</p><p>Much like before, the world they entered changed its location from when they had entered it. Every one of the tidal waves pushed the worlds closer and closer to the outer perimeter of the Archaic World so even though it was in a different area of space, it had done nothing to lengthen their trip.</p><p>As they left the middle area of the Archaic World, Hui Yue suddenly felt strange. He felt as if he had been walking around with weights on his body and now that these weights were removed he could move much more agilely than he had ever been able to before.</p><p>It was not only him who felt the sudden change, but everyone was stunned. They soon realized why this was the case. The Ancestral Worldpower within the middle area was just so dense. As it wrapped around their bodies, it had worked exactly like weights, weighting them down and slowing all their movements.</p><p>Although the density of Ancestral Worldpower within the outer perimeter was dense compared to the rest of the galaxy, it was truly nothing compared to the middle area. Now they all moved with a speed that they had a hard time believing.</p><p>&quot;This is good news,&quot; Hui Yue said to the others as he nodded his head, but he was not just positive about it. &quot;Although we now have some advantage in our speed and our strength, we need to remember that we can no longer wantonly absorb the Ancestral Worldpower in the surroundings.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Although we are still getting more Ancestral Worldpower now than we were before, it is nothing compared to the middle area, and when we finally leave the Archaic World, we will have to work hard to increase our Ancestral Worldpower pools.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue did not want to be pessimistic about it, but he knew that they had benefitted greatly from their time in the middle area, but even so, he also knew that it could not last forever.</p><p>As they returned to the outer perimeter, Hui Yue and his group did nothing to conceal their movements. They knew that this was a place where dragons and tigers roamed with chickens and dogs.</p><p>Some gained wealth by fighting ancient beasts or searching for treasures and herbs on their own in the different worlds, while others seemed to gain their wealth by ambushing, robbing, and killing other experts.</p><p>There were many bandit groups within the outer perimeter of the Archaic World, and some of them were rather large.</p><p>When Hui Yue and his group traveled through the outer perimeter, the smaller groups would leave them alone because their shuttle was incredibly big and the group was rather large, but other groups, the bandit groups that counted fifty to hundred expert members, did not hold back.</p><p>Their group was attacked time and time again, and the way they dealt with them was different. Sometimes they would rely on the formations that had been placed on the ship-like shuttle to pave a way through the bandits.</p><p>Other times they would deactivate the formation and fight the bandits head-on. Although they did not want to waste too much time within the Archaic World, Hui Yue understood that they would benefit from fighting. They had gained many things in the middle area of the Archaic World, including new perfect bodies.</p><p>They would gain much from fighting. This would let them get used to their bodies, and have enlightenments on their daos or learn new ways of attacking and utilizing their powers.</p><p>The closer they got to the outside world the less the Ancestral Worldpower bore down upon them and the easier it was for them to move.</p><p>They skillfully managed to get rid of anyone who came their way to cause trouble. Only after slaughtering quite a few bandit groups did they realize just how much of a difference the time they had spent in the middle area really made.</p><p>&quot;They are too weak,&quot; Jo complained as she looked at the many corpses that littered the ground around them. The bandits had outnumbered them by a lot, but even so, none of them had managed to escape with their lives intact.</p><p>This was the biggest bandit group in the entire Archaic World. They had been lured to their group because of rumors about their wealth that had spread long ago. But despite their numbers and status, even this group ended up dead with nowhere to bury their comrades and no one to mourn their deaths.</p><p>Instead, Hui Yue and the others gladly ruminated through these experts&#x2019; clothes to find their storage treasures and claim them as their own.</p><p>Although they had been in the Archaic World for a long time, they all felt that they had not earned enough wealth.</p><p>Hui Yue had taken all the wealth from the old sect, but other than that, all the treasure they had were herbs and beast corpses.</p><p>The beast corpses were worth quite a bit, and they would all sell them as soon as they reached the Blissful realm, but the herbs were not going to be sold.</p><p>They all understood that these herbs were important to Hui Yue for him to be able to continue creating the various pills he made for everyone, and their friendship was obviously much more important than the Worldpower Stones they could get from the herbs.</p><p>Hui Yue had promised to share all the wealth he got from the treasures from the old sect evenly amongst them, but they still felt that even with those treasures split up was it really enough to call their adventure fruitful in terms of earning money?</p><p>Truthfully they were all too greedy. They had benefitted greatly from the trip when it came to their strength. They had gotten perfect bodies, and everyone had made breakthroughs with their daos.</p><p>Even so, they still held an amazing amount of materials and treasures that they would sell. These things were worth quite a pretty penny, but because it was all stuck in Hui Yue&apos;s storage treasure, the others felt that their wealth was lacking.</p><p>Also, they were used to seeing meat pies dropping from the skies. They had gained so much wealth during their trip that they did not know when to stop wishing for more.</p><p>After the large group of bandits had attacked them, many had observed the fight with the mentality of fishing in troubled waters, only to find that it was an effortless victory for Hui Yue and his friends.</p><p>Many had seen this battle, so rumors quickly spread in the Archaic World about an unbeatable group that had appeared. Soon someone realized that it was the group that had previously entered and exited every single world they went to. Now though this group didn&apos;t seem to care about any of the worlds around them. It was clear that during the time they hadn&#x2019;t been heard from, they had managed to find what it was they were searching for.</p><p>Many were curious about what exactly it was they found, but after thinking it over, no one dared to attack them. Although they had faith in their own strength, they knew their limitations. Even the biggest bandit group had been annihilated with seemingly no effort at all.</p><p>Had it not been for people seeing the fight for themselves, then they would not have believed it, but seeing it was indeed believing and no one got close to them afterwards.</p><p>After half a year of travels within the Archaic World more and more people appeared around them as they came to the outer edges of the Archaic World. Exiting the Archaic World, they felt as if someone had suddenly removed all the Ancestral Worldpower in the surrounding area. Although there was still energy, it was so weak that it could not compare to what they had experienced before.</p><p>Their bodies which continued to refine Ancestral Worldpower still refined the energy, but the stream of energy which was refined turned from a vast river into a small stream.</p><p>Smiling wryly, Hui Yue knew this would only get worse the further away from the Archaic World they went, but even so, he had decided that it was time for them to leave this unstable world.</p><p>They had other, more important, things they needed to deal with now. Amongst others, they need to prepare to strike An He so that the Divine Beast World could exit the Universe Box and return to become one of the major worlds in the galaxy.</p><p>&quot;Well, we are going back to Youdu,&quot; Hui Yue said with a sigh. He had not forgotten that he had promised Yanluo and Chujiang a new body when he succeeded in locating the Alchemist God.</p><p>&quot;But before we go there, let us enter the Blissful realm once more. Let&#x2019;s trade our items for Worldpower Stones. Worldpower Stones are after all more interesting than the bloodied corpses we have within our storage treasures right now.&quot;</p><p>No one disagreed. Although the corpses would never grow old and rot in their storage treasures, it was still nauseating as every time they had to take something out, they&apos;d come across corpses.</p><p>The shuttle headed straight for the Blissful Realm and they arrived after ten days of flying. Everyone was excited although they did not show it on their expressions. They knew their items were worth something, but how much would they be worth?</p><p>If the beasts had been alive, then the price for each corpse would be at least ten times their current price, but sadly, they were all dead. Still, they had so many corpses that they could not even count them. Although they were ten times less valuable, if you had enough it would still become an amazing amount of wealth.</p><p>Reaching the realm, they were not blocked by anyone silly this time, and as soon as the entrance fee was paid all of them entered the Blissful realm.</p><p>&quot;We are going to find an inn,&quot; Hui Yue decided. &quot;Then we will split up. We can go in smaller groups and sell our wares as we see fit. The things you have in your storage treasures belong to you and only you, sell them at whatever price you feel is reasonable. I will come back, and will share the sect valuables with you all tomorrow morning.&quot;</p><p>No one said anything against the decision he made, and they all nodded their heads.</p><p>Together the group looked around them and found a good inn that had enough space to accommodate all of them. The inn was quite nice, and some of the Gods decided to stay behind and have a good meal before they left to sell the items they had acquired.</p><p>Hui Yue, Huli, Sha Yun, and Wang Ju Long instantly left the inn together with Pei Ziqi and Wei.</p><p>Pei Ziqi and Wei had to follow him anywhere he went. Pei Ziqi was after all his dao protector, and Wei was a guard who had been chosen to look after him.</p><p>Although Wei no longer was stronger than Hui Yue he still took his job seriously. Hui Yue had opened a whole new world for him, and he was forever grateful. Even though Wei was there on the orders of Yanluo, he too had been given a new body, and he was given just as many pills as all the others.</p><p>His cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds, but he had not been able to follow Hui Yue&apos;s advancements.</p><p>Still, Wei was certain that if something happened then he could at least serve as a meat shield, and because of this, he followed Hui Yue.</p><p>Wei and Pei Ziqi were aware of their positions, and therefore they stayed a bit behind, but they never left their young master out of sight. They would not allow for him to get into a dangerous situation, yet they did not think that anything could threaten him with his current strength and Huli by his side.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
