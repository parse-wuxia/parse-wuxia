Although they had slept in proper beds every night, and had a very comfortable journey, their trip had been hard on their mental fortitude. Constantly thinking about their next step, about entering the Central Palace, caused them to be both worried and excited but also exhausted as all they could do was think about all that might happen without truly being able to do anything yet. The only one who was still awake was Huli. She was laying on top of Hui Yue, her eyes open and staring at everything around them with vigilant eyes. It was as though she was worried about something.</p><br><p><span style="">Having traveled in the carriage none of them were able to do anything except cultivate, yet now they finally felt close to the next stage of their journey, something which caused them to be overwhelmed with exhaustion. Now that they suddenly had the opportunity to rest, they took advantage of it to get some much needed sleep.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Although all of them were tired, after four hours everyone apart from Wang Ju Long woke up and met in the restaurant on the ground level of the inn.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Let&#x2019;s go eat.&quot; Hui Yue suggested, and the others agreed quickly. While eating, they could both wait for Wang Ju Long to wake up and get their meal at the same time. </span></p><br><p><span style="">All the meals on the table were from magical beasts that had been hunted within the Sunset Mountains. Some were delicacies and were very expensive, while others were more ordinary and cheaper. Hui Yue ordered a little bit of everything so that they could share and eat what they preferred.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The restaurant was filled with people, and the table Hui Yue found was situated in the back, out of the way. Although no one around them knew their true destination causing trouble would not be a good idea. </span></p><br><p><span style="">When they entered the restaurant their group caused quite a few to look their way but seeing that they found a table in the far corner and were not interested in troubling others, everyone decided not to trouble Hui Yue&apos;s group. One had to remember that their aura was unmatched. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Having talked and eaten in the restaurant for a couple of hours, more and more people had arrived while others had taken their leave. Hui Yue watched as a large group of experts entered the restaurant, their voices were loud and their appearances rough.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;There are no beautiful women in this d*mned town! What do they expect us to do? We should move to one of the larger cities.&quot; One of the men said, and the moment they had entered through the door, everyone else in the restaurant had quieted down. The only conversation that could be heard apart from this group was others whispers. Even Hui Yue and his group were silently watching them, however, where the others looked at them with fear, Hui Yue&apos;s group only had curiosity in their eyes.</span></p><br><p>&quot;Oh! Check out that beauty!&quot; Someone suddenly said as they pointed towards the stairs causing Hui Yue and his friends to look up. As soon as they saw the beauty, they couldn&#x2019;t help but shake their heads. &quot;Should we help?&quot; Sha Yun whispered worriedly as she saw greed in the eyes of these rouge cultivators. The beauty walking down the stairs was none other than the green-dressed Wang Ju Long, and seeing the looks she was getting, Sha Yun couldn&#x2019;t help but fill with anger. She already looked upon Wang Ju Long as her family, as a sister, and they were clearly looking down on her.</p><br><p><span style="">A smile was on Hui Yue&apos;s face as he shook his head causing the others to be surprised. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;She&apos;s an Emperor.&quot; Hui Yue said seriously. &quot;Those experts, the strongest is at the King rank while the others are Dukes. King ranked experts are strong in a city as small as this one, but Ju Long is not easy to deal with for anyone, even people on her level.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue continue. &quot;She is a poison master, and also an Emperor ranked expert. Fighting against the entire group might be impossible for others, but do you really think that a poison master cannot defeat a group of experts weaker than herself?&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">Being quiet for some time the others realized that he was correct. &quot;We have never actually seen Ju Long fight.&quot; He continued while looking intently at what was happening in front of him. &quot;Although she has done all she can to avoid fighting, don&apos;t underestimate her. If she were not worthy of being our companion, why would I allow her to come with us? You know I cannot handle to see her hurt, so obviously I believe in her power to have taken her with us on this trip.&quot;</span></p><br><p><span style="">As they heard this, the others nodded their heads. The eyes they used to look at Wang Ju Long were very different from earlier, now they were not filled with worry, instead, they were filled with anticipation. Anticipation to see just how Wang Ju Long would handle these rowdy experts.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Wang Ju Long&apos;s eyes swept across the entire lower floor, resting but a moment on the group which just spoke before she located Hui Yue and the others. With resolute steps, she moved straight towards them, not even giving the other group a second glance.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;It seems that she is together with someone. Come back here!&quot; An expert called out, but Wang Ju Long completely ignored him and moved towards the seats where Hui Yue was waiting for her. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Grab her! The leader likes her so take her to him. Anyone who stands in our way will be annihilated.&quot; The same man as before called out as a group of ten experts rushed through the room, completely ignorant of what they were destroying on their way. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Tables were tilted, plates and glasses were shattered as they landed on the ground causing food to be splattered everywhere. </span></p><br><p><span style="">As soon as they reached Wang Ju Long, all of them lifted their hands and tried to grab her, but moments after she easily dodged them. Her hands flashed and spiritual energy left her body as a small cloud appeared around it. The moment their hands tried to enter the cloud, all of them released blood-curdling screams as their arms started to corrode. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Their arms turned black and started to be eaten away by the mist; their screams sounded throughout the restaurant as the advancing experts collapsed to the ground. Looking at them with cold eyes, Wang Ju Long sighed and turned to look at the King ranked expert who was shivering greatly. &quot;These three need to cut off their infected limbs, or they&apos;ll die.&quot; She said as if she didn&#x2019;t care either way and moved towards Hui Yue&apos;s table where she sat down and filled her plate with delicacies, eating them as though they had been ordered specifically for her.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">The King ranked expert rushed to the side of his friends and cut off their infected limbs, but even though he was filled with fear he was not dumb enough to continue his attack on Wang Ju Long. For her to make his subordinates as wounded as she had, he already knew that she was far stronger than him. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Many experts in the restaurant looked at Wang Ju Long as though she were some celestial being who had just descended from the heavens above. Her actions caused everyone in the restaurant to shockingly look at the group with reverence in their eyes.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Sighing, Hui Yue shook his head. So much for being low key and not drawing attention to themselves. Still, had Wang Ju Long not stopped them, then he would have had to step in, and he was likely to be even less polite. He probably would not let them go with just a missing a limb or two.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;You are actually so frightening mom!&quot; Jo said with admiration in her voice. Her eyes were wide with amazement and excitement was all over her face.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;It was nothing.&quot; Wang Ju Long said blushing as she tried to focus on the horned demon crab in front of her, trying to get the meat from its legs. </span></p><br><p><span style="">The others joined in, praising Wang Ju Long. Even Deng Wu was excited, &quot;let me spar with you!&quot; He said excitedly but the moment he spoke a roasted carrot landed squarely on his face. &quot;If you want to duel, why not fight me? I would gladly teach you how to fight.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile on his face.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;No, brother Yue! Please don&apos;t! I swear I was just joking!&quot; Hearing the pleading in his voice everyone around the table started laughing. Even the embarrassed Wang Ju Long could not help but release her bright laughter.</span></p><br><p><span style="">The group completely ignored the young King ranked expert who was dragging his wounded friends out of the restaurant. They simply did not see him as a danger to them and thus they did not kill him, nor did they even bother paying him any attention.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;When we finish eating, let&#x2019;s explore the city and see if there is anything interesting here.&quot; Hui Yue said smilingly as he too ate some of the delicious food. </span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Let big brother show you around.&quot; Deng Wu said with pride in his voice, and everyone laughed at him once more while he pushed out his chest and tried to look important.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Deng Wu had been to the Sunset Mountains many times over the last couple of years. Every time, he would join various adventure groups to capture strong soul shadows of various beasts.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Because he often came to the Sunset Mountains, Deng Wu had also been to this city before. However it had been a very brief stop, and he was not truly familiar with the location.</span></p><br><p><span style="">&quot;Well, in that case, we will trust you.&quot; Sha Yun said with a smile on her face. &quot;But if you take us to an entertainment house with many beautiful maids, don&apos;t blame us for telling Xing when we return home.&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hearing her words, Deng Wu&apos;s body turned rigid and a somewhat worried smile appeared. &quot;Yun, dearest Yun, you are my good brother&apos;s wife, how could you tell on your husband&apos;s good brother?&quot; </span></p><br><p><span style="">Once again everyone laughed, and their laughter rang throughout the otherwise silent restaurant. Many had still not coped with the fact that the young man and his men had been beaten so miserably by a young woman. Looking at the entire group in front of them, they all seemed equally terrifying.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Finishing the food, everyone stood up. Hui Yue left the money including a tip on the table, and they exited the restaurant ready to see the city they were currently within.</span></p><br><p><span style="">Walking down the street, most people rushed out of their way. Some looked at them fearfully; others looked at them with curiosity. Everyone had already heard about this group and the beautiful woman who had managed to cripple a whole group of people with just one move. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Reaching the middle of town they found a square filled with merchants and mercenaries selling and buying things. Whistling in surprise, Hui Yue started looking at the many stalls and bought a few items here and there, mainly rare herbs and beast cores. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Hui Yue was not the only one buying items. Jo purchased snacks in all the stalls she could find. Her eyes shone brightly, and her face was filled with a smile. &quot;Keep eating like this, and you&apos;ll be rolling around soon.&quot; Lao said lovingly as he rustled Jo&apos;s hair, but all he got in return was Jo sticking out her tongue continuing to eat her snacks. </span></p><br><p><span style="">Listening to the two kids, Hui Yue smiled, but he did not interfere. Seeing the siblings as carefree as this truly made him happy.</span></p><br><br><br></div><p></p>
