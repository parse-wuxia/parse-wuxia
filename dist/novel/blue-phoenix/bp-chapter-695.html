Everyone with a bit of knowledge within the galaxy knew about Pei Yue, yet she was certain that she had never before met this young man, yet now that she was looking at this young man, she instantly recognized him.</p><p>This young man had previously been cheated by her guard, and her already angered self, became even more angered by the fact that now he most certainly did not have a good impression of her Blissful realm.</p><p>Although she knew it was probably impossible for him to greatly pressure her Blissful realm, she was also aware that if he really used all power available to him alongside the rumors that had started to spread then her realm might only see half the business it had so far. This was something she did not want to see happen.</p><p>&quot;I am here to answer for what has happened,&quot; she said with gritted teeth, and Hui Yue, who had been seated with crossed legs and arms, slowly stood up and dusted his robe clean.</p><p>&quot;Follow me to the guard&apos;s headquarters,&quot; she ordered, and together the two of them headed to the guard&apos;s headquarters.</p><p>&quot;Anyone who had something to do with the incident today step forward!&quot; The woman called out, her voice infused with Ancestral Worldpower, but even so, no one stepped forward.</p><p>The angered woman was not someone to look down upon. Her blood was boiling as her eyes glared at every single one of the guards in front of her.</p><p>&quot;If no one steps forward, I will simply punish everyone,&quot; she said casually, and hearing this, the faces of the guards present turned ugly. The punishment, if light, would be a fine, but if it were severe, they would be fired or even beaten.</p><p>Although they were comrades, they also knew that the ones in question had taken bribes. Although they would suffer slightly, they had gained something substantial from this transaction, whereas the rest of them had gained absolutely nothing, and were likely to lose quite a bit because of the greed of their fellow guards. In such a situation, they were not the most loyal of brothers.</p><p>&quot;Wang Fang was one of them!&quot; A person suddenly blurted out. He did not seem apologetic at all for throwing one of his comrades under the bus. But since things had escalated to this point, he was not going to sacrifice his own safety or own pay for someone else&apos;s benefit.</p><p>&quot;Song Jie was also one of the ones who was bribed,&quot; another voiced sounded out, and soon everyone voiced out names of who they knew had been bribed.</p><p>The more names that were said, the darker the mistress&apos; face became. At first, she had thought it was merely a high-ranked guard who had ordered all the others to stay away, but now it seemed that it was quite a few guards who had various ranks within the Blissful Guards.</p><p>&quot;Others?&quot; She said with a voice dripping with anger, but no one else said anything before a minor figure stepped forward and nodded his head. &quot;I was also paid to stay out of it,&quot; he admitted before swiping his eyes across the rest of their comrades.</p><p>No one had mentioned him, but he felt that his honor would not allow for him to be the only one who went unpunished.</p><p>&quot;Good. Very good. At least you have the courage to show yourself!&quot; She said with a high-pitched voice, and everyone who heard it sensed her anger.</p><p>Hui Yue who stood behind her said nothing but he could sense that something was about to happen to these people. His arms were crossed over his chest, and his lips were curled into a small smile.</p><p>&quot;This young master is Pei Yue, the most esteemed youth in the Celestial Sword Sect and the Second King of Hell from Diyu!&quot;</p><p>&quot;If something had happened to him on our ground, how do you think Diyu and the Celestial Sword Sect would have reacted? Do you honestly think you could have gotten away with it alive?&quot;</p><p>Without waiting for anyone to answer, she continued to speak. &quot;This is a calamity for our Blissful realm. I have time and time again told you all that you are not allowed to be partial, that you need to be neutral to the factions at all cost, but you still did something as stupid as agreeing to let some assassins run wild in my realm for nothing more than a little wealth!? Do I pay you that badly?!&quot;</p><p>Truthfully the pay for a Blissful Guard was incredibly high considering their profession, and this was also the reason that others would always be eager to become a part of the Blissful Guard.</p><p>&quot;I will be stripping you all of your rights to call yourself the Blissful Guard. I will not ask any questions about why you did what you did, nor will I approve of you being otherwise punished within my Blissful realm, but as for what might happen after you leave&#x2026; Well, that is no longer any of my concern.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Will this satisfy your anger?&quot; The woman turned to look at Hui Yue, who nodded his head. He had no use for the Worldpower Stones they had earned from conspiring against him. He knew that it would be impossible to harm them inside the Blissful realm since there were rules against fighting here, but he did not have the patience to wait for them to leave the realm either. Still, he knew they would be fearful for a very long time, and that alone was punishment enough. Constantly walking around in fear for one&#x2019;s life was in no way comfortable.</p><p>&quot;Thank you for finding justice for us,&quot; Hui Yue said with a nod of his head as he cupped his hands to her. Sensing that he truly did not hold any lingering anger or hostility towards them, the woman heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>The bad rumors that had appeared could be dealt with in time, and some might not even believe them, but if Hui Yue truly wanted to cause problems, then he could do so easily.</p><p>The guards that had been stripped of their jobs were all pale. Being a Blissful Guard was not just for show. They had a very good salary that allowed for them and their families to live a great life within the Blissful realm.</p><p>If they wanted to continue living as they had, then they needed to earn a good deal of money, yet to do so without being a member of the Blissful Guard was hard. They would have to risk their lives in the Archaic World, and that was in no way something they wished to do.</p><p>Still, they only had themselves to blame for this. They grit their teeth as they bowed deeply before turning to change their clothes and handing in the emblems that displayed their positions as a guard.</p><p>Hui Yue did not linger to see what happened to them. He still wanted to make it to the Blissful Pavilion to see if he could sell all his treasures. Right after leaving the courtyard of the guards, he went straight to the side and entered the Blissful Pavilion.</p><p>The woman had followed behind him and was confused when she saw him entering the Blissful Pavilion, but she still decided to go with him to ensure that he received the best possible treatment.</p><p>The moment she appeared inside the Blissful Pavilion everyone bowed deeply, and no one dared step forward. It did not take long before a manager appeared and bowed deeply to the mistress and Hui Yue.</p><p>&quot;This lowly one is an elder of the Blissful Pavilion, what can I do for the young master?&quot;</p><p>The elder was incredibly smart. He was originally planning on greeting the owner of the realm, but when his eyes locked with hers she gave a warning glance at Hui Yue, and the elder instantly turned his attention to the young man.</p><p>Hui Yue was currently alone. He was not with Huli, Sha Yun, or Wang Ju Long right now; he had left them with the others outside the keep. He told them all to return to the inn while he sorted everything out.</p><p>&quot;I would like to sell some treasures I came across in the Archaic World.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile towards the humble elder from the Blissful Pavilion.</p><p>&quot;Yes, of course. Please, follow me.&quot; the elder said as he gently led Hui Yue inside a room. Although he was polite and humble on the outside, he was not so humble on the inside.</p><p>He was an elder from the Blissful Pavilion. Which treasures had he not already seen before? This young man, how could he possibly produce any treasures that were worthy of his eyes?</p><p>Hui Yue seemed to be oblivious to what this elder was thinking, or he simply did not care as he followed behind into an appraisal room.</p><p>The room was spacious. It was much more spacious than the other appraisal rooms, and Hui Yue nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><p>The owner of the realm followed into the room, half out of worry that Hui Yue was treated well, half out of curiosity for which treasures this young man would take out.</p><p>As they entered, the elder turned around his face filled with an enormous smile, &quot;Please, show me your treasures,&quot; he said while smiling brightly, and Hui Yue nodded his head and waved his hand.</p><p>Treasures started to pile up within the room. Statues, figurines, jewelry, paintings, and they fell everywhere! He saw corpses of so many different fierce beasts and countless precious metals.</p><p>They saw mountains of armor and weapons and even hills of pills appeared.</p><p>The elder, who had secretly been quite disdainful towards the treasures that Hui Yue could bring out was stunned silly.</p><p>One has to know that although there were many treasures waiting for people in the Archaic World, it was incredibly rare for one person to actually find many of them.</p><p>Not to mention that here in front of him was a mountain of treasures, and these items were all of high quality. The beasts were all ones who had comprehended more than one major dao, their bodies were infused with the dao they controlled, and their value far exceeded any other beast you could find in the Archaic World.</p><p>The armor and weapons were all treasures. If one were to find one of these items they would be considered lucky, yet here was a whole mountain of them stacked in the room as if they were mere garbage on the side of the road.</p><p>The jewelry, statues, figures, paintings, and so on were also worth an amazing amount of money. They had various uses for many experts as many collected them for their homes to show off how powerful they were. Many supreme experts, especially, like such priceless ornate treasures from the Archaic World which was vastly older than almost every God in the galaxy.</p><p>&quot;This will take some time to go through,&quot; he said with a frown, and then excused himself after which he rushed out of the room before quickly returning with another four elders.</p><p>Together the five men started from one corner of the room and went through every single item. They were discussing among themselves. While they busied themselves, Hui Yue and the owner of the realm were seated at a table slowly sipping tea as they watched.</p><p>Hour after hour went by and the more treasure they valuated, the more they discussed and the more heated the discussion became.</p><p>It was clear that the items that were present in the room were not ordinary. This treasury was truly something they would pay a great price to own.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
