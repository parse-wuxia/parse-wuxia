The Alchemist God frowned but just as he was about to speak, Hui Yue continued.</p><p>&quot;I am not asking you to do this for me for the small favors I have brought you. I heard that you are wounded, and I can guess that your soul is damaged.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Being an alchemist incapable of creating pills truly sounds like a torturous life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I happen to control the Nirvana Phoenix Flame which excels at restoring souls and nurturing them back to health.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What I am offering is to heal your internal wounds. I will help restore your soul, and in return, you can teach me how to create and refine supreme bodies.&quot;</p><p>The Alchemist God who had been frowning looked at Hui Yue curiously this time. &quot;I guess that Little Green told you that I am wounded, but how could you tell that it was my soul that was wounded? What was the clue to this?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was because of a ghost we met earlier,&quot; Hui Yue answered truthfully. &quot;There was a ghost who met you in this world, and he told us that you did not create any pills during the whole time he stayed together with you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are an alchemist who enjoys concocting pills so the only reason you did not would be because you cannot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Also you did not create a body for Little Green not because you were worried about becoming more wounded but because you were simply incapable of refining anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The only reason I could find would be that your soul is wounded.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand that your lifeforce was also weakened, but lifeforce is easy to establish again, especially for an alchemist like you. The only place that would truly wound you and cause such damage is a wound to your soul as a wound to the soul is the hardest to cure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You are correct,&quot; the Alchemist God sighed as he sat down on a chair. &quot;I had reached the apex in alchemy. I could not go any further, and thus I decided to try and do the only thing I could think about to further improve on my dao of alchemy. That was to create a Sentient pill!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I had long since heard rumors about a sentient pill in the Archaic World, and I figured that if a pill could become sentient, then it should be possible to create one as well.&quot;</p><p>&quot;After countless attempts, I finally concocted a pill, and I gave this pill some of my soul, but sadly, in the end, it was a failure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Back then I did not understand what it truly meant for a pill to become sentient.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since I failed I have been unable to concoct even one more pill. It was excruciating and infuriating. In the end, I gave up everything and entered the Archaic World to search for this world and the sentient pill in the hope that I would be able to restore my soul and once more tread down the dao of alchemy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I found this world fairly easily, and as I did, I have gained much. I have gained such profound understanding of alchemy from Xiao Hui, but despite this, neither of us were able to restore my soul.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Soul restoring items are truly rare in this galaxy. I had been unable to find them, but here you are, showing up out of the blue with the Nirvana Phoenix Flame. It seems that I am a fortunate expert who will be able to concoct my pills once again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you heal my soul then I will pass down everything I know about alchemy to you,&quot; he said solemnly. &quot;I will make you my legacy apprentice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can sense that you have the Universe Box and Huli is by your side. I will not ask you what happened to my old student, as I know that you were not his killer, you only benefitted from his misfortune, but even so, I hope that you will not end up like him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I will only have one legacy apprentice in my entire life. If you are willing to take me as your master, acknowledge me as such and I will never let you down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That being said, I will not leave this world for a very long time,&quot; the Alchemist God smiled. &quot;I have been learning theories about alchemy for so long without being able to put them into practice. When my soul is healed, I will once more start to concoct and experiment.&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue dropped to his legs and kowtowed to the Alchemist God three times. He kowtowed to acknowledge him as his master.</p><p>The Alchemist God was feeling emotional as he looked at this young man in front of him. And Hui Yue too felt emotional looking at the middle-aged man. A master for a day, a father for a lifetime.</p><p>&quot;In that case, I will gift you this pill,&quot; The Alchemist God picked up a small purple jade bottle from his robes and placed it in Hui Yue&apos;s hands.</p><p>&quot;This pill is the one I tried to make into a sentient pill. Although it did not succeed, it is still the most potent pill I have ever created. It has a third of my soul contained within, and I can sense that you have soulforce. Consuming this pill will make your soulforce become even more frightening than it is right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;These pills are for you all,&quot; The Alchemist God said as he spread out his hand, and jade bottles appeared all over before they shot towards every one of Hui Yue&apos;s friends. &quot;Don&apos;t take them yet,&quot; he warned them. &quot;I assume that this disciple of mine wishes to make a refined supreme body for each of you, and in that case, you will benefit the most from consuming these pills after integrating with your new bodies.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Humans are exciting! Beasts are fun!&quot; Xiao Hui exclaimed suddenly. He had been very quiet most of the time, but he just said this with a childish expression on his face while looking very different from all the others with his golden hair and blue eyes.</p><p>Hui Lei, Jo, and Lao went towards Xiao Hui and started talking with him about their trips, and he listened with wide eyes. Although he was a sentient pill, who was able to understand the profound questions of alchemy, he had grown up in this world alone without anything other than the plants around him.</p><p>Travelers had come from time to time, but all of them left eventually, and many of them had tried to capture him. Only the Alchemist God had stayed as a friend, and now three young experts had appeared. The four of them had many things in common, and they discussed cultivating, the outside world, and what it meant to be alive.</p><p>The discussion turned philosophical and deep, and all of them were intensely focused on it.</p><p>&quot;Everyone find yourself a courtyard here in the residential area. All the courtyards should be neatly looked after, and clean, so you can go ahead and pick whichever you want to use.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suggest two or three people per courtyard. After you have settled in feel free to do what you wish to do.&quot;</p><p>Everyone looked at Hui Yue to hear what his thoughts were, and he pondered for some time, &quot;I will be learning under the Alchemist God from now on, so feel free to explore the world. You can also explore the rest of the sect and see if you can find more treasures.&quot;</p><p>With the mention of treasures, everyone turned excited. They all wanted to find sentient treasures and subdue them, but they were all aware that the likelihood of that happening was very small. Still, they wished to explore the entire world and see what they could find.</p><p>&quot;If you pick up the herbs, remember what I told you before,&quot; Hui Yue warned them, &quot;Always make sure that there is enough for them to survive. We do not want to lay this world bare.&quot;</p><p>They all nodded their heads, and while Jo, Lao, and Lei were busy chatting with Xiao Hui, all the others scattered and started looking for a courtyard to stay at.</p><p>&quot;Yue, you will be staying with Yun and me,&quot; Huli said as she pointed towards Sha Yun. &quot;We will go ahead and find a courtyard for us to stay in so do not accept anyone else than us!&quot;</p><p>Hui Yue smiled wryly. He was certain that no one else would be expecting him to stay with them, but he also felt warmth in his heart because he knew that these two girls were looking out for him.</p><p>&quot;It is nice to be young,&quot; The Alchemist God laughed, but Hui Yue just smiled. &quot;I assume Little Green will move here?&quot; He asked, and the previously smiling Alchemist God could not help but cough as his face turned slightly red.</p><p>&quot;How does Little Green have anything to do with our conversation?&quot; He asked perplexed, but Hui Yue just smiled and shook his head. Although he respected the Alchemist God greatly, he also felt that it was fine to be himself around him. He did not have to pretend to be someone he was not.</p><p>&quot;Master, tell me, are you an Overlord?&quot; Hui Yue suddenly asked. This question had been on his mind for a long time, and whenever he looked at the Alchemist God, he felt that he was indeed an Overlord. He was so mysterious and overwhelmingly strong that there was no other explanation.</p><p>When the Alchemist God heard the question he raised an eyebrow. &quot;You know about Overlords, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I met Yama.&quot; Hui Yue was certain that a person such as the Alchemist God already knew about Yama, and thus he did not hesitate to mention him. If he did not know who Yama was from hearing the name then there was nothing more he could say; he either knew him or didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&quot;Oh did you now?&quot; The Alchemist God was surprised. &quot;I thought that only his ten Judges of Hell were allowed to see him, and only when King Yanluo was present.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I happened to be a temporary Judge of Hell,&quot; Hui Yue said with a grin. &quot;Your friend King Chujiang died when he was in the Archaic World looking for you. But he was resurrected, and is now getting ready to return to his job as a King of Hell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I need to make a refined body for him though.&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile. He had to refine a lot of bodies!</p><p>&quot;I am not an Overlord,&quot; the Alchemist God said with a smile. &quot;But I am very close to breaking through into the Overlord ranks.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I see. Anyway, master, let us move to another room so that I can heal your soul.&quot;</p><p>To Hui Yue, it was rather important that the Alchemist God was healed as soon as possible. The sooner he was healed, the sooner he could teach Hui Yue the way of alchemy.</p><p>Sensing Hui Yue&apos;s urgency the Alchemist God nodded his head, and the two of them left the four youngsters on the ground floor of the courtyard and moved towards the upper floor.</p><p>Hui Yue was led into a room where there was nothing other than a bed, and the Alchemist God sat down on the bed.</p><p>&quot;I hope your Nirvana Phoenix Flame is large enough to heal my soul,&quot; the Alchemist God sighed. He was very well aware that when a wisp of flame had been used, then it would forever be gone.</p><p>Although he was worried, Hui Yue was not worried about it. He already knew that he still had a large chunk of flame left, and it was definitely enough to heal even an Overlord&apos;s soul.</p><p></p></div><p></p>
