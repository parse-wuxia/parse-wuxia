His body was still enhanced by the endurance of the red gem from his core, but just defense would not win him this battle. Attacking, Hui Yue swung the sword as light reflected itself in the blade and he drew it down in front of him, looking as if he were slashing in the air, reaching out towards the opposing expert.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This tower master had, however, learned from his mistake. He no longer allowed for Hui Yue to get close to him and managed to pull back every time Hui Yue advanced. He clearly took Hui Yue&#x2019;s sword arts seriously as he could still feel the stabbing pain in his arm and the pool of blood on the ground was also a grim reminder that he need to be wary of this youngster&#x2019;s sword.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting without an arm was a great disadvantage and considering that he had still not healed it, Hui Yue was able to see that he had no healing abilities which relieved him. The battle was going to be much simpler since he could not heal himself.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue activated the dao of devouring and constantly absorbed Ancestral Worldpower from the world around him to boost his combat abilities. His biggest disadvantage against others was that he did not have much Ancestral Worldpower, and currently, he was using quite a bit of it as he relied on the dao of the sword for each of his attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Do you think that you are the only one who can devour?!&quot; The tower master asked with laughter in his voice as he spread his arms. The Ancestral Worldpower within the chamber started to rotate in two directions; some went towards Hui Yue while some went towards the tower master.</p><p dir="ltr">As the tower master absorbed Ancestral Worldpower, the wound on his arm slowly started healing. It stopped bleeding and the wound on his arm closed.</p><p dir="ltr">The body of a human God was made from Ancestral Worldpower, and thus it would be healed if he used his Ancestral Worldpower to heal the wound. Hui Yue, who was new to the God ranks naturally had no experience in fighting other Gods, and thus he was not expecting to see this.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Before he realized what happened, the tower master who had retreated took a step forward. His hands were shining with a golden light, and a loud boom resounded as Hui Yue was forced backward several steps. His body was shaking, and he almost coughed up blood.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the defenses of the red gem blocked the attacks that now rained down upon him, Hui Yue&apos;s insides were shaken again and again. He felt like a bat was hitting him repeatedly. He was forced all the way back to the entrance of the tower before he finally caught his balance and managed to steal a glance at the tower master.</p><p dir="ltr">The tower master was breathing heavily, and swordlight was shining all around him. It was clear that what had felt like bats slamming into him were actually slashes of swordlight, but due to the protection of the red gem, these slashes had become dull. Despite the red gem&#x2019;s power, it was still impossible to fully negate the force behind them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Good, very good! You seem to have some secret technique to protect your body!&quot; The tower master guessed, and his face turned hideous once more. But he was not going to give Hui Yue any time to breathe as he attacked with renewed vigor once more when he suddenly sensed a blue mist surrounding him.</p><p dir="ltr">This blue mist covered the entire tower, and although the tower master was alert against it, he could not see what it did. Was this the dao of mist? The dao of clouds? He did not know, and he could not see what it could do for Hui Yue, so he just ignored it.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment that he chose to ignore the blue cloud, Hui Yue could not help but snicker. The blue cloud entered the body of the expert, and Hui Yue skillfully avoided one attack after another while the tower master became slower and slower with his movements.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;What&#x2019;s going on?!&quot; The tower master exclaimed shocked. He simmered with anger as his body became heavier and heavier. Hui Yue, on the other hand, just laughed and shook his head, &quot;You should absorb some more energy.&quot; He said as he continued to dodge most of the swordlight attacking him. He only allowed a few attacks he really couldn&apos;t avoid hit his body.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Argh!&quot; The tower master was shocked by those words, and he retreated as quickly as he could while observing the inside of his body. Energy was floating through his body but mixed with the energy that he was absorbing from the surrounding areas was a blue mist that mingled with the energy. This blue mist slowed down the speed at which his energy was rotating through his body, and thus it affected all of the tower master&apos;s movements.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing this blue energy that he had completely disregarded causing this effect in his body, he was filled with anger.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Heup!&quot; He called out, and the Ancestral Worldpower in his body burst out like a missile, attacking the blue mist ferociously. He no longer absorbed the energy from his surroundings, and instead, he forced this energy out of his system.</p><p dir="ltr">While the tower master was busy fighting the blue mist, Hui Yue was not just sitting idly by. The Sword of the Icy Tempest within his hand flashed as he advanced once again and thrust out, stabbing again and again at the expert.</p><p dir="ltr">His swordlight parried some of these attacks, but he was incapable of blocking all of it and blood splashed out as he was stabbed more than a few times.</p><p dir="ltr">Although he was aware of this, the tower master couldn&#x2019;t avoid it. If he wished to have a chance, he needed to get rid of this blue energy first. Only then would he be able to counterattack.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The Ancestral Worldpower in the surrounding area was all being absorbed by Hui Yue. Now that the tower master was no longer absorbing the energy it was free for Hui Yue take.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You are better than I thought!&quot; The tower master said through gritted teeth, &quot;You are truly able to make me angered. That a cultivator like you is able to make me this angered is truly unfathomable.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As the tower master spoke, his body enlarged. The air within the room became pressured, and the ground started shattering underneath his feet. The pressure he emitted was no joke. Although he had used his Ancestral Worldpower to get rid of this blue energy within his body, he had even more Ancestral Worldpower than Hui Yue could imagine, and suddenly this energy was released. As it surged outwards, it created an intense pressure and this pressure alone was enough to push Hui Yue backward.</p><p dir="ltr">Gritting his teeth, Hui Yue felt the sudden change in atmosphere and understood that he had once again underestimated the opponent he was up against.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I need to become even stronger if I want to stand against this kind of pressure. Although I have the defense of the red gem, it will not be enough,&quot; he mused to himself and reached out to one of his last options, the red wolf.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His body transformed, and his aura surged. Along with his increase in strength came an insatiable bloodlust. This bloodlust made him look at the tower master with the eyes of a hunter who had just found its prey.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Even the tower master, who was releasing his energy felt a sudden chill down his spine when he saw Hui Yue&apos;s transformation. This feeling grew even more intense when he saw the change in Hui Yue&#x2019;s eyes, but it only lasted for a short while before he started laughing out loud, &quot;A dog! Your true shape is that of a dog! What a joke! Now get beaten like one!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Outside the tower were the two Fu brothers. Both had been ready to take action when they saw the tower master&#x2019;s aura sharply increase as he grew taller.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;How can he be a wolf?!&quot; Fu Ziyu asked shocked when he saw Hui Yue&apos;s shape change, &quot;he has the bloodline of the great roc, not the bloodline of some red dog! I&#x2019;ve never heard of someone who has two bloodlines in their bodies, that is simply impossible! The dominant bloodline would take over and completely devour the other! The Celestial Sword Sect has tried it for so many years but has had no success whatsoever!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Maybe his father or mother was a red wolf, and somehow he is an exception,&quot; Fu Jinyan guessed as he looked at Hui Yue within the tower. Hui Yue had still not noticed them as his entire focus was in the room on the tower master.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This young man is more and more interesting,&quot; Fu Ziyu said and contemplated for some time before he once more took out the glass ball which he used to call Pei Ze.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Master,&quot; he said as soon as he saw the face of young master Pei Ze. &quot;This lowly one apologizes for contacting you again, but there is something shocking with the young man we are following.&quot; He said and turned the orb so that it recorded Hui Yue who was currently in his beast form.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;This red wolf is the master of the great roc&#x2019;s wings. It seems that he has two bloodlines within his body.&quot; The more Fu Ziyu spoke, the lower his voice became as he watched the two Gods in the chamber. Hui Yue, although much weaker, was not losing ground, even though the opponent was much stronger.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Keep an eye on him and if he does anything else outstanding contact me again,&quot; Pei Ze ordered, and the glass ball turned dim. As for what the young master was thinking, no one knew.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back into the chamber the battle had finally begun. Fire burst forth from Hui Yue. His arms were covered in flames which took the form of small volatile balls of energy that would explode on contact. This was clearly the dao of inferno, the most volatile and explosive of any of the fire daos.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This dao was filling up the entire chamber as the temperature inside rose drastically. Where the sword previously had failed to do much damage to the tower master, these concentrated balls of fire energy were able to blast him away and scorch his skin. The power within them was so overpowering that even someone who had an advantage in Ancestral Worldpower would easily get wounded by them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting with more and more desperation, Hui Yue knew that his Ancestral Worldpower could only last for so long and he was already at the very edge of running out. Now he was fully sustaining himself by absorbing energy from his surroundings.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Realizing that he was in a bad spot, Hui Yue knew he had one last ace up his sleeves, but it was an incredibly risky move. He was not certain that it would work and thus he would rather focus on something else instead.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His body was bustling with energy, and the lifeforce he had stored was strengthening his body and the Ancestral Worldpower he was absorbing was able to sustain him for some time.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;It&apos;s now or never,&quot; Hui Yue said to himself, and all the energy he had in his body was rotating through his wolf body. He took a step forward, and the ground on the floor cracked underneath his steps. At first, his steps were slow, but he picked up the pace quite quickly, and soon he ran towards the tower master. His every move contained his full power behind it, and he was soon in front of his opponent.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Energy from the dao of the inferno covered his clenched fist, and with a simple but powerful jab, Hui Yue slam his fist into the face of the tower master. A small explosion was heard as his inferno fist exploded out and the tower master was pushed backward by the sudden power and strength behind Hui Yue&apos;s fist.</p><br></div><p></p>
