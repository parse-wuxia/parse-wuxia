Hui Yue dedicated everything he had to learning formations and increasing the number of seals he could control while Huli stayed by his side the whole time.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Bai&apos;s face lit up with a great smile as Hui Yue was many times more talented than he had first assumed. In the following month, Hui Yue had already managed to reach a hundred seals, and he had still not reached a bottleneck. He was continuing to compress seals whenever he needed a break from creating formations.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">No one spoke much within the Formation Palace. Pei Bai would spend all his time going through the massive amount of formations they had and find the most suitable ones for Hui Yue. Hui Yue would train, and Huli would observe him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The life went like this for a full month before it was finally time for Hui Yue to go to the City of Endless Clouds once more.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Last time he had gone, he was attacked by the shadowy demon assassin, but Huli had saved him in time. Unfortunately, it had interrupted his time together with his friends and caused quite a ruckus in the Celestial Sword Sect because as a result, he brought Huli back with him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they left the Formation Palace together, the many members of the Celestial Sword Sect which were flying around in the air or walking on the ground all stared at him and Huli with curiosity.</p><p dir="ltr">The elders had been incapable of keeping their mouths shut when they saw such an amazing dowry and had told their families about it. Their families told other members of their families, and eventually, the entire Celestial Sword Sect knew about the situation.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Many experts were very jealous of Hui Yue. They had heard that Huli was a peerless beauty, unrivaled in cultivation and this woman had chosen to be engaged to a simple Primordial Immortal. Although he was talented and of the third generation, these geniuses all felt that they were a much better choice than him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue and Huli completely ignored everyone staring at them. They held each other&apos;s hand and flew out of the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s inner sect heading towards the City of Endless Clouds.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was no rare sight that a member of the inner sect went to the City of Endless Clouds, and even as Hui Yue headed towards the city, he saw that others were doing the same. All of them were staring at Hui Yue and Huli with no intention of hiding their curiosity.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Jie should be at the City of Endless Clouds already,&quot; Hui Yue told Huli ignoring the many people who paid attention to them. &quot;I spoke with Wei earlier through the communication orbs, and he said that Jie arrived yesterday. I am curious to see what exactly is so important that he wanted to talk with me about it.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Huli shrugged her shoulders as she intently observed their surroundings. She was alert as she feared another attack could happen at any time. Having Huli by his side made Hui Yue feel much more secure than before. Thinking of how he had felt observed before, Hui Yue could still feel countless gazes on his body, but these were all from people out in the open who were talking with each other, there was no feeling of danger to them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as they reached the gates of the city they entered. The first time Hui Yue had been here, he had been stunned by the beauty and sheer size of the city alongside the crowded streets, but this was already his third time here, so he was no longer fazed.</p><p dir="ltr">Never once did Hui Yue let go of Huli&apos;s hand. When they had been flying he held her hand and now that they were walking he still held her hand ensuring that the two of them did not get separated in the crowd.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This time they did not go to the open square in front of the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s pagoda. Instead, they moved towards the restaurant that Wei had taken Hui Yue to the first time they met in the city.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This restaurant was located in the more upper scale area of town, and it was tightly guarded by the law enforcers that patrolled the busy streets.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was the most active part of town, and many of the shops that sold rare goods and foods were located on this street.</p><p dir="ltr">Aiming straight for the restaurant, Hui Yue and Huli paid no attention to the many wondrous items that had been laid out in front of the shops. Hui Yue&apos;s entire mind was on Cai Jie and what the young man wanted to talk with him about.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Do you need a seat for two?&quot; a waitress asked while looking at Hui Yue with dreaming eyes. How she too wished that she could find a cultivator to follow and fall in love with.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are here to meet up with some friends,&quot; Hui Yue said as he looked into the open dining room. &quot;I assume they have a room upstairs. The one in charge of the group is named Wei. Please check if he is here yet.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">The waitress nodded her head and went to a small counter where she looked in a book. &quot;There is indeed a young master Wei in our store right now,&quot; she said politely before looking at Hui Yue. &quot;Please give me your name, and I will go ask whether or not this guest wishes for you to join them.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that she could not just bring them directly to the room in case they weren&apos;t friends, but enemies. Their restaurant was one of the best in town, and although no one was silly enough to cause trouble within the premises. They might try to annoy people they were hostile towards to lure the other party into attacking them first.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue did not care and nodded his head as he looked around the rest of the restaurant. The waitress rushed upstairs to speak with Wei.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The ground floor of the restaurant was quite crowded. Every chair was filled, and there was even a line of people waiting to be accepted into the restaurant. A wonderful aroma assaulted Hui Yue as delicious foods were present everywhere in the restaurant. Delicate fruit wines were being served with the rare and tasty meals, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">There were quite a few members of the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s inner sect within the restaurant, and although they did not notice Hui Yue when he first came in, after standing at the entrance for some time most eventually did take notice of him. Everyone who saw him had the same thoughts, &#x2018;What was so special about this Primordial Immortal?&#x2019;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">While almost everyone kept their curiosity to themselves, one person could not contain himself. He had been famed as a genius member of the Celestial Sword Sect since he was born. He had been the number one member of the younger generation, and now he was an Immortal of Creation that many of the elders of the sect placed much of their hopes on.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had married three wives so far, all of them from reputable families, and he had gotten quite a dowry from them as well. But ever since Hui Yue had appeared, he felt threatened.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This was a Primordial Immortal who was capable of going toe to toe with Immortals of Creations. That alone was simply unheard of unless the person was a Crowned Sovereign that used all the power of the world they controlled.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Apart from this, his training talent was simply too amazing. To go from being born a mortal to a God, and not even a new God but a Primordial Immortal as fast as he supposedly had was unheard of.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He had also shown talent not only for cultivation but also for the formation arts which meant that he had soulforce, something this genius had wished for all his life! Those with soulforce were superior to other cultivators on their level!</p><p dir="ltr">Now he had appeared with a woman who had paid a dowry that was simply way too extravagant. Any one of the things she had taken out would already have been better than any other dowry, and yet she had handed over three different priceless treasures!</p><p dir="ltr">This was something he could not accept. He was the genius! Why had this young man appeared from out of nowhere and why did he have such an astonishing woman?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was already quite renowned within the sect. He was the undisputed number one of the entire younger generation of all the major sects. He was the Second Judge of Hell as well. He had become a God after merely fifty years, and he had a woman by his side whose background was so shocking that no one was able to see through her! And that is not even mentioning that just her strength alone was nothing to joke about.</p><p dir="ltr">Rage flared within his heart. He was the genius! But because he was from an ordinary family within the inner sect, he was not rich. He had saved up Worldpower Stones and contribution points to reach his current strength. Once a month he would allow himself to enter the City of Endless Clouds and eat at this restaurant because some of the rare foods they had would increase his Ancestral Worldpower pool by a great deal, but even so, it always hurt his wallet when he had to fork out money for the meal.</p><p dir="ltr">This was another reason he was jealous of Hui Yue. Hui Yue was a third generation descendant. He was the only surviving son of the Ancestor Pei Tian. There was no way he would not have tons of Worldpower Stones, and he could likely eat at the restaurant every single day if he wanted.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You, Young Master Pei Yue!&quot; he called out while trying to suppress the hate and anger he felt rising within him. His face displayed a brilliant smile, but his eyes were cold and filled with hate which he could not mask.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at him, Hui Yue sneered silently. It was clear that this Immortal of Creation had no friendly feelings towards him even though they were from the same sect.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Oh, hello!&quot; Hui Yue said with a smile on his face as he understood that showing hostility would make him seem like the villain. He was also very curious as to what this young man wanted from him, &quot;I am afraid I do not know you.&quot; He continued as he looked at the advancing expert while smiling gently. Anyone from the inner sect who heard his words almost choked on their food.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">This Immortal of Creation was rather famous within the sect, yet Hui Yue said he did not know him. This was an insult, yet no one could really blame Hui Yue considering he was new to the sect. How could he possibly remember every genius that the members of the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s inner sect had?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">The face of the Immortal of Creation turned livid, his eyes bulged and he almost lost his temper, but with a great effort, he managed to reign in his hate. &quot;I am Pei Yan. A humble member of the Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s inner sect. I have long since heard about you and your fiance&apos;s great deeds and your outstanding talent. To meet you today was truly my luck!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Just as he spoke the waitress returned from the room and went to Hui Yue after which she nodded to him.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Sorry, I need to meet up with someone. We have a rather important meeting, but I hope to meet you again Pei Yan. It would be great to get to know you better.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Having said that, Hui Yue paid him no more attention and moved straight to the second floor. Seeing this Pei Yan&apos;s face twisted. He knew that the upper floors were at least ten times more expensive as the ground floor where he ate.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
