Because of this, he needed quite a few days to recuperate and once more feel Ancestral Worldpower flowing through his body. It was during this time when he had very little energy that he had been in a state of comprehension.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">By now he was far more familiar with the daos he had at his disposal, and he had fully gained control over the dao of gale. All of this was due to his battle with the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth, and he could not help but feel a bit grateful.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze was his friend, so for him to come looking for him a few times a day was not surprising, but Hui Yue could not help and wonder what he would say when they met face to face. Would he congratulate Hui Yue wholeheartedly or would he perhaps feel inferior?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue could not help but hope that nothing had changed between the two of them. He knew that in the future he would go by the name Pei Yue and that as a member of the Celestial Sword Sect, he would need friends, friends other than just the elders.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When thinking about friends, he felt nostalgic as he was reminded of all his friends back in the Divine Beast World. He had left them behind for so long, and he could not wait to see them again. Now that the trials were over, he should be safe to let the nine beast Gods and Huli out of the Universe Box, but, sadly, there was still other friends, his best friends, who still had yet to become Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was rather impatient. He was eager for his friends to become God ranked cultivators so that they could all roam the galaxy together, gain strength together, and explore the many mysteries together. He could not wait to see them increase their strength little by little so that everyone could finally stand strong against An He.</p><p dir="ltr">When he thought about An He, hate flared up inside of Hui Yue. He hated An He and Rong Liang so much that he knew it was impossible for the three of them to exist in the same universe. Soon it would indeed be necessary to kill or be killed! Someone would die!</p><p dir="ltr">When he thought about Rong Liang, Hui Yue&apos;s mood turned increasingly foul as he not only thought about Wang Ju Long&apos;s sacrifice but also about Rong Ming. There were so many things he did not know, and he could not help but feel worried about Rong Ming with whatever he was doing now. He was also worried that one day he would have to fight him.</p><p dir="ltr">Deep in his mind, he remembered the years when he was a small child, and he would wait every year for Rong Ming and Rong Xing to visit him when they traveled to the magical forest. He remembered how Rong Ming would gift him flowers and he chuckled when he remembered how this old friend of his had thought that he was a girl.</p><p dir="ltr">He remembered how they had attended the Royal Academy together and there they had encountered hardships but stuck together nevertheless.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He remembered everything that he had experienced together with Rong Ming and his heart ached. Those days were the simplest and happiest days of his life, and he would sacrifice anything to protect the ones who were dear to him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Sighing, Hui Yue stopped thinking about it and looked out a window instead. Wei was still by his side, but the guard could sense that Hui Yue was deep in thought and did not want to trouble him. He had heard Yanluo mention the resurrection of a loved one, and when he thought about this, he finally got to see some of the true pain that this otherwise cheerful person carried with him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was still deep in thought when a knock was heard on the door which drew him back to reality. Nodding to Wei, the guard went to open the door and outside was Pei Ze, smiling brightly, and standing next to him was the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth. He seemed to be grumbling slightly, but not putting up much of a fight.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I met the young master on the way here,&quot; Pei Ze explained with laughter as he dragged the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s Youth into the room with him. He then turned to look at Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Honestly, when you said that you would become the next Judge of Hell, I truly did not believe you! Yet look at you now! Soon you will be bestowed the title of Chujiang!&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;We are amazed by your ability, and we wished to see how you were doing, but why is it that when I look at you, I get the impression that you are even stronger than before?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze did not hold anything back and asked straight away, but Hui Yue just laughed and waved his hand. &quot;I had a lucky breakthrough while I was unconscious,&quot; he said without going into details. But his simple statement made both Pei Ze and the youth stunned. They had thought that he was on the verge of collapsing because of the state of his physical body, but in fact, the reason it had taken him so long to recover was that he was in a state of enlightenment!</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze had no words to describe how much he revered Hui Yue. It had long since become clear that Hui Yue was someone who could not be considered apart of their younger generation; he was indeed a dragon amongst men, a tiger ready to pounce!</p><p dir="ltr">Even the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth, who had always thought of himself as a blessing from the heavens reigned in some of his arrogance when he heard this. Now he really understood that he was no longer the most talented person around. Although this should have made him unsatisfied, for some reason, he was filled with excitement. He would make Hui Yue acknowledge him as his rival!</p><p dir="ltr">While all three were busy thinking their own things, they all had smiles on their faces as they made small talk with one another. They talked about how the tournament had gone, how their performance had been, and even the weather was discussed yet none of them seemed to notice what was being said.</p><p dir="ltr">On the side, Wei had a wry smile on his lips as he saw this. It was clear for him to see what all of them were thinking but he still said nothing and just laughed silently.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">He understood that Hui Yue was like a force of nature. He was uncontrollable and could erupt with tremendous power if needed. Even he, who was an esteemed Immortal of Creation, dared not take the Phoenix Descent head on. Heck, he was scared silly by just the golden lightning bolts of the Nine Tribulation&#x2019;s Lightning that he had seen.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">When thinking this, he also noticed that although Hui Yue was stronger than the two experts in the chamber, and had beaten both of them before in the trials, neither seemed to hold any resentment towards Hui Yue. in fact, it seemed as if they were grateful.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will stay here for the duration of your coronation,&quot; the Nightcrawler Sect&apos;s youth said with a smile at Hui Yue. &quot;After that, I will return to the sect, but a year later in the great sect assembly you better show up! Then we will see if your phoenix or my world of darkness is stronger!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue could not promise anything. He knew that it was not likely that he would stay in the sect for long as he had plenty of things to do, but he still nodded his head. With a calm voice, he said, &quot;If I can make it, then I definitely will. If I cannot then, I will come find you and we can fight at that time.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, a smile broke out on the youth&#x2019;s face. This was something not even Pei Ze had ever seen before on his face. Both he and Hui Yue could only stare stunned at the youth in front of them, who then seemingly became self-aware. His face flared red, and he looked down embarrassed.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;I will take my leave,&quot; he said quickly as he turned to leave.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Who would have guessed that a few casual words would make him so happy,&quot; Pei Ze mumbled to himself, but he quickly shook his head forgetting all about it. He then turned to Hui Yue again smiling as his eyes glistened.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Your last battle, tell me, did you use a third bloodline or was that an Ancestral Worldpower Skill?&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Although Pei Ze was curious, he was also asking for the sake of the sect. The elders had not been able to find an answer, and thus they had gone to ask Pei Ze to see if he could wrist the answer from Hui Yue, but the white-haired young man just shook his head and said nothing.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Understanding that he was not willing to answer, Pei Ze was not angry. He was just even more curious than before. Could it be that Hui Yue himself did not know what this magnificent attack was?&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Without spending any more time discussing it, Pei Ze continued to talk about how marvelous he thought Hui Yue was, and he would ask questions here and there. Hui Yue would answer most of them honestly, yet as soon as it had to do with Lan Feng and his power, Hui Yue would apologetically shake his head and not answer at all.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Wei was listening curiously. He too found Hui Yue&apos;s powers to be outstanding, and he could not help but wonder just how on earth Hui Yue had reached such a level in a mere fifty years. He must have had lucky encounters every single year to have such amazing skills!</p><p dir="ltr">Although he thought like this, Wei was not jealous of Hui Yue but excited for the future. As a guard who had been given the order to look after this young man, Hui Yue had become the focal point of his life. He would rather die than let someone else lay a hand on his new master.</p><p dir="ltr">This was the true heart of a knight. Where many were selfish creatures, Wei was fully devoted to his master Yanluo. Now that Yanluo had given him a new master, he would be fully devoted to Hui Yue. Especially since he had been treated so well during the time they had been together, and even more so now that he was a Judge of Hell.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was starting to feel how his entire body was greedily absorbing Ancestral Worldpower in the entire room. He could feel his soulforce growing rapidly from devouring the soul energy, and he excused himself telling the older man that he was rather tired and needed rest. Pei Ze, letting Yue get some rest, instantly got up and left saying he would come again later.</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue felt slightly guilty about lying, but he could also feel that something was happening in his body, something he could not ignore. He sat still in meditation, greedily absorbing all the energies around him.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">His body had become like a sponge that had been placed in water. The Ancestral Worldpower and soul energy in the surrounding area became chaotic, and all of it rushed to Hui Yue.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, it was rather subtle, and even Wei did not notice it, but it kept increasing in power, and soon, even the rest of the castle started noticing that something was attracting the Ancestral Worldpower and soul energy that surrounded the entire palace!</p><br></div><p></p>
