He bowed slightly and reached out his arm to allow for Hui Yue to walk through the door first.</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing that he was trying to reel him in, Hui Yue was contemplating whether or not he should accept this kind of attention as he knew very well that he had his own goals. He was not sure that fully backing Pei Ze was a good idea as he was not planning to stay in the Celestial Sword Sect for long.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaving the chamber, Hui Yue was quite impressed that Pei Ze was able to find his way around the massive Celestial Sword Sect&apos;s mansion.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;First let&#x2019;s get a room prepared for you and your beast.&quot; Pei Ze started out as he turned right and left in rapid succession. Sometimes they walked through narrow entranceways, other times they walked through massive halls.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although they walked through so many rooms and hallways, they saw nothing other than servants. Every servant was a God ranked expert, and many of them felt as if they had the same amount of Ancestral Worldpower that Hui Yue had. However, these experts did not have the ability to comprehend different daos, and although they were Gods, their future was limited. For this reason, many of these talentless cultivators became servants or other kinds of workers within these massive immortal cities.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">These servants were all incredibly polite towards Pei Ze, all of them bowed deeply upon seeing him, but Pei Ze kept moving as if he never even saw them.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It was not before now that Hui Yue started to understand that although Pei Ze was friendly towards him, he was indeed a young master who had arrogance rooted deep within his bones.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Walking for almost an hour, and seeing nothing but servants, they finally reached a large black door. Although the door was large, it was not beautifully adorned like all the other doors they had seen, if anything, it was incredibly ordinary.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze headed directly for this door and knocked on it with enough force for the knocks to be heard on the other side but not so loud that it resounded through the empty hallway.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">It took less than a minute before the heavy door opened, and a mature but beautiful woman appeared in front of them. Her face was stern and her lips tightly clenched. Her eyes were filled with seriousness, but when she saw Pei Ze, she smiled slightly.</p><p dir="ltr">The strangest thing was that Pei Ze, who had completely ignored any servants so far, did not show even the slightest bit of anger towards this woman.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Madame Rou, please let me introduce you to young master Pei Yue.&quot; Pei Ze started his introduction, &quot;Pei Yue is a new member of our family, and he happens to be a third-generation descendant of the great roc.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Pei Yue has been living outside of the sect his entire life, so he is limited in what he knows about our sect. But now that he is a part of our family, it is our responsibility to look after him. I am here to have a room prepared for him. Preferably a room close to my own so that I can assist him with anything he might have problems with.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing Pei Ze call Hui Yue, Pei Yue, he was quite surprised and a little uncomfortable. To him, his name would always be Hui Yue and to change it was not an option, but he also understood the patriarch&#x2019;s position who had to make it so that Hui Yue integrated into their family.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;A young man who was born outside of the sect has not only been allowed to live but also allowed to maintain the reputation of a third-generation descendant? That is quite astonishing; I cannot help but wonder what secrets this boy possesses,&quot; the lady said casually as she gave Hui Yue a glance but did nothing more than that. She did not seem very curious.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Considering he is of the younger generation he does not have the needed recognition to be housed close to you, but&#x2026; Maybe based on him being of the third-generation, that might be enough on its own,&quot; the woman pondered out loud as her hand stroked her chin.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze said nothing, he just waited for the woman to decide on her own what she wanted to do, and by his side, Hui Yue said nothing either. He was new to the sect and would like to be close to someone who wished to help him in the future with the things he did not understand.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Okay. I will clear the room on the right from yours and let him in later tonight. It will take my girls around three hours to have it fully equipped and ready for him. He has the right to some extra benefits which will take some time to get set up. Also, I see that he has a rather astonishing beast companion. This companion will probably live in the same room as him, so we need to move an extra bed into the room. Just so you know, you cannot reproduce with this beast of yours or the beast and the child will both be executed. That is unless she is approved of by the sect leader or someone ranked higher like the patriarch or the ancestors.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hui Yue was not interested in having children just yet, but there was a sour taste in his mouth when he realized that the mother of his future children had to be approved of by the high-ranked members of the Celestial Sword Sect. Hui Yue already had three women he loved, and he would be with them forever whether the upper echelons of the Celestial Sword Sect approved of it or not.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">Although he thought like this, he said nothing but the hand that was holding Huli&apos;s gripped tighter around her slender fingers, not willing to let go. This feeling was easily projected to Huli.</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing the words of this woman, Huli felt uncomfortable. She too did not feel ready to have children, but one day she wanted to have Hui Yue&apos;s child. Was this truly impossible because of the rules of the sect? In that case, Hui Yue did not need to be part of the sect, Huli thought. But just as her indignation and anger were rising, she felt the hand that held hers tighten. She instantly knew that he was not going to let go of her, no matter who stood in their way.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Thank you for your time Madame Rou,&quot; Pei Ze said with a slight bow before he turned to leave. Hui Yue quickly gave a bow of his own towards the woman before he followed behind his guide.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Madame Rou is the manager of this mansion,&quot; Pei Ze explained. &quot;Her name is Pei Rou, and although she is in control of all servants in this mansion, do not look down on her. She is a fifth generation expert, and she could have become an elder, but she preferred to stay here in Youdu and take care of our Youdu branch of the Celestial Sword Sect. She is very frightening when she is mad, and although she is not an elder, when we are here in Youdu, her rank is no less than that of a head elder. Always treat her with the respect she deserves or you will regret it.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Now that you have met Madame Rou, it is time for me to introduce you to the younger generation of the Celestial Sword Sect. I am going to let them all know about your might as a third-generation descendant. You see most of us from the younger generation are all between the tenth and the twelfth generations.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;To be considered a part of the younger generation one needs to be beneath two hundred and fifty years. You not even being a century old are considered one of the youngest, but fortunately, strength and age are not always the same thing. If we look at your skills and comprehension of the dao, then you are in the upper-ranks of the younger generation.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Most of the younger generation have arrived in Youdu. We were directly invited by Yanluo, and although we know that the majority stand no chance in this trial, they will still be getting some experience. Real combat experience is quite hard to come by, and thus events like this are great for every major family. It is not only rogue cultivators who have appeared by the thousand-fold, but the major families have also sent more experts than you can imagine.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;None of us knows what the trials will be like or what they are; we just know that if one of the members of our family could end up becoming the Judge of Hell, then our family will definitely treat this expert exceptionally well. Even possibly make that person into the next sect leader.&quot; Having said this, Pei Ze&apos;s face turned slightly red from excitement, but he quickly got his emotions under control.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;Well, let&#x2019;s not talk about all of this,&quot; Pei Ze laughed. &quot;I will take you to the sparring field first. I imagine that a large group of experts are there sparring against one another for the sake of improving their combat ability before the trials.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;When we get there, and I tell them about you, it is likely that some of them will have a hard time accepting that you are still alive and are not supposed to be executed. Some of them might challenge you. Obviously, you can choose to either accept or decline, but if you accept know that you cannot kill or cripple your opponent. Even if they are someone you dislike, do not forget that you are from the same sect! Fratricide is forbidden!&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing this, Hui Yue snorted. Not long ago the patriarch and elders had considered killing him. If they truly valued their bloodline so much and hated disciples killing each other, why kill outsiders with the same bloodline?. Had it not been because the wings on his back were so brilliant, had the strength of his bloodline not been obvious then he would already be dead.</p><p dir="ltr">Pei Ze understood why Hui Yue snorted but said nothing. Instead, he just kept leading Hui Yue towards the sparring field. While walking there, they found more and more experts heading that way as well.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot;You there, follow us,&quot; Pei Ze would call out to them. &quot;I have an important announcement from the patriarch. Follow me to the sparring fields.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as all of these experts heard Pei Ze&apos;s words, they all followed right behind him, together they all made it to the sparring field.</p><p dir="ltr">The sparing field was massive! It was at least the size of ten Hui mansions right next to one another. There were one platform after another and also countless dummies that one could attack. There were also tracks with obstacles for one to challenge.&#xA0;</p><p dir="ltr">As they arrived at the sparring field, Hui Yue saw that it was filled with experts. There were at least two hundred, but when he thought about the fact that the younger generation included everyone up to two hundred and fifty years old, then he was not too shocked any longer. It would be weird if the younger generation of such a major family were small.&#xA0;</p><br></div><p></p>
