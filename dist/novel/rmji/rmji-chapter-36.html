<p><strong>Chapter 36 Shocked.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p></p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>Chapter 36: Shocked</strong></p><p></p><p><span style="">Seeing that Han Li became furious, Li Feiyu did not get angry. Instead, Li Feiyu remained indifferent.</span></p><p><span style="">He tilted his head, stuck his pinky into his ear, and concentrated on cleaning his ear. Han Li&#x2019;s reaction was an appropriate and expected one.</span></p><p><span style="">After Han Li had vented his anger, he saw that Li Feiyu remained as brazen as a city wall, almost as if he had not heard any of Han Li&#x2019;s remarks. Han Li calmed down, sensing that something was off.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are not a fool, nor are you an egomaniac. You wouldn&#x2019;t do anything that would get yourself killed. You must tell me what your reason was behind such a reckless action right now,&#x201D; Han Li gravely demanded.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Feiyu, seeing that Han Li&#x2019;s anger was quickly being replaced once again by reason, felt somewhat regretful. He assumed a wronged and pitiful appearance and repeatedly complained of this injustice by shouting, &#x201C;Heavens! I&#x2019;m being wrongly accused!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A moment ago, I was actually about to give you an explanation, but you didn&#x2019;t even give me a chance to open my mouth!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now you&#x2019;re complaining about me, am I truly no longer a person in your eyes!?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">This kind of whining was obviously fake. Anyone who took a quick glance at this farce would feel annoyed after seeing through the act.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li also could not help but think of taking advantage of the situation and stepped forward, fiercely kicking Li Feiyu, who was resembling a sh!t-eating dog.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Give me less acting and more explaining. Quickly!&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You scoundrel. If the junior disciples that admire you see your lazy appearance, your image as a powerful and confident fighter would be completely shattered.&#x201D; Han Li gave him a bit of a mocking expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li currently had no time to vent his anger and argue with Li Feiyu. If this secret exchange was not handled well, the two of them would face enormous consequences.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Feiyu seemed to realize what Han Li was thinking at this moment and no longer ridiculed or denounced him. Rather, he lazily walked over to the bundle and picked up a rare book.</span></p><p><span style="">After standing up straight, his face had a mysterious radiance. With a smile that was simultaneously not a genuine smile, he handed the book over to Han Li. Afterwards, signalling with his eyes, Li Feiyu beckoned Han Li to look at the book&#x2019;s cover.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li reached out with his hand to receive the very thin and rare book, giving Li Feiyu a look filled with doubt.</span></p><p><span style="">He was at a bit of a loss, not knowing what sort of crafty scheme Li Feiyu was plotting.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Open it and take a look for yourself. If you do, you&#x2019;ll understand everything.&#x201D; Li Feiyu deliberately used a mysterious tone in order to coax Han Li into examining the book.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What, you can&#x2019;t say it outright? What&#x2019;s the point of trying to keep it a mystery?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although hesitation was evident on Han Li&#x2019;s face, he flipped through the pages of the book.</span></p><p><span style="">He opened the cover, revealing the first page of the rare manual. The top of the page, neatly written in black and white, were three large words: &#x201C;Blinking Sword Art&#x201D;. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;En!&#x201D; Han Li was slightly astounded.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li was astonished that the first book Li Feiyu had given to him was exactly what he desired.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t lose your focus. Come and see the rest of the books.&#x201D; Li Feiyu tossed over a few nearby rare manuals in succession. </span></p><p><span style="">Han Li caught the books one by one and was completely stunned after quickly skimming through their entirety..</span></p><p><span style="">All of their titles were clearly written with black and white characters: &#x201C;Blinking Sword Art&#x201D;.</span></p><p><span style="">Only after a long while had passed did Han Li lift his gaze from the books in his hands.</span></p><p><span style="">Pointing his finger at the large pile of secret manuals on the ground, Han Li asked stammeringly, &#x201C;You&#x2026; you cannot possibly tell me&#x2026; that these&#x2026;. these&#x2026; these are all manuals for &#x201C;Blinking Sword Art&#x201D;!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am very sorry, Junior Disciple Han. You have indeed guessed correctly.&#x201D; Li Feiyu shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands; his face wearing an expression of helplessness. </span></p><p><span style="">Although Li Feiyu seemed apologetic, his feelings did not coincide with his words. The corner of his mouth rose faintly as he derived pleasure from Han Li&#x2019;s frustration.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is impossible! There are almost a hundred books here, so how could all of these possibly be manuals for Blinking Sword Art?&#x201D; Unable to stomach Li Feiyu&#x2019;s cheap tricks, Han Li questioned Li Feiyu because he was filled with great doubt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re asking me? Who was I even supposed ask in order to verify that they were the right manuals without getting caught?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I was at the corner of the Seven Supreme Division&#x2019;s library when I suddenly came upon so many rare manuals sharing the same name. I, too, was shocked!&#x201D; Li Feiyu rolled his eyes and mumbled to himself, giving off the appearance of having lingering trauma.</span></p><p><span style="">Soon after, he saw Han Li&#x2019;s dumbfounded expression and couldn&#x2019;t help but laugh heartily.</span></p><p><span style="">Li Feiyu would later say that seeing Han Li suffer such a shock was indeed a rare and impressive sight.</span></p><p><span style="">Ordinarily, Han Li&#x2019;s face was always calm and composed, as if he always had a card up his sleeve. For Han Li to be shocked was near impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">At this moment, Han Li had such a numb, foolish look that made Li Feiyu feel that these past few days had been well worth the taxing effort. </span></p><p><span style="">After a moment, Han Li had at last cleared his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">He tightly grabbed several books with his hands and lowered his head, deep in thought. Then, with a thought, he looked up and asked neither slowly nor rushed, &#x201C;Did you count how many manuals were in the bundle?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In total, how many manuals did you bring?&#x201D; Han Li once again asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Naturally, I counted the manuals multiple times. Altogether, there are seventy four books, all with the same name.&#x201D; Li Feiyu immediately replied, without any hesitation. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we don&#x2019;t know the exact quantity of manuals and fail to return one or two books, we might draw ourselves unwanted attention, which might prove troublesome,&#x201D; Han Li immediately explained.</span></p><p><span style="">He softly pinched the somewhat yellow pages, slowly turning them over as he carefully skimmed one of the secret manuals in his hand.</span></p><p></p><div style="margin: 8px 0px"><p></p><p></p></div><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
