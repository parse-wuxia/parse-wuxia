<p><strong>Chapter 485: Freezing Over</strong></p><p>As the Nascent Soul cultivators clashed, Wu Chou and the Bone Sage experienced a great surprise while they suppressed the flame wolf.</p><p>With a growl, the two heads of the wolf warped together, transforming it into a huge, horned silver-furred wolf.</p><p>It then proceeded to lower its head and fiercely shot a burst of silver light from its horn.</p><p>Although the burst of light was only half a foot long, it released a piercing wail upon leaving the horn. In the blink of an eye, a large hole was now gaping in the body of the black python and the net had been dissolved.</p><p>The green net immediately turned into smoke upon touching the silver light and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>When Wu Chou and Zenith Yin saw this, they were shocked.</p><p>Wu Chou hastily made an incantation seal and pointed, shooting a black light towards the extinguished black python. The large hole in it immediately started to close while emitting sparks of faint light, stabilizing the python&#x2019;s body. As for the Bone Sage, after a brief moment of astonishment, he stared at the huge silver wolf as if he had thought of something. He hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth with a solemn expression, and spat out a dark green knife. The knife was only several inches long and handleless. From a glance at the size of its increasing radiance, one could tell it was abnormal.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s heart stirred and he couldn&#x2019;t help but take another look at the magic treasure. If he wasn&#x2019;t mistaken, the knife was a transformed version of the Bone Sage&#x2019;s Gold Lightning Bamboo Arrow. He was merely using a magic technique to conceal its original form.</p><p>Could it be that the Bone Sage had gone mad? Zenith Yin was in the sky and he still dared to use his magic treasure. Zenith Yin surely must&#x2019;ve used this treasure to plot against him long ago. Although the Bone Sage managed to conceal its brilliance, it was unable to escape the notice of Han Li, who had refined his own magic treasure from Gold Lightning Bamboo. It was far too bold of an action.</p><p>Han Li began to hesitate and had second thoughts, &#x2018;Could it be that the silver wolf is so exceptional that the old devil is willing to take such a huge risk to claim it?&#x2019;</p><p>In that instant, the huge silver wolf suddenly shrunk in size and turned into a foot tall miniature in the blink of an eye. Then with a flash of silver light, it flew towards the altar&#x2019;s hole in a blur, breaking away from Wu Chou and the Bone Sage.</p><p>When the Bone Sage saw this, he immediately threw out his knife, shooting out a green streak. With a resounding bang, the small knife knocked away the silver wolf, but it didn&#x2019;t receive any damage from the impact.</p><p>As it just so happened, the silver wolf was knocked in the direction of Han Li. With such a fine gift knocking at his door, Han Li instantly threw any apprehensions he had to the back of his mind and threw his flower basket towards the silver wolf. Fearing that this treasure wouldn&#x2019;t be enough to capture the wolf, Han Li patted his storage pouch with his other hand, tossing the a chain of five copper bands after the wolf as well. He blew a breath of Azure Qi onto the chain of copper bands, causing it to flash with rainbow light and disappear without a trace.</p><p>Soon after, a clear ring suddenly sounded out. Before the silver wolf could dart away again, the five copper bands suddenly appeared around its limbs and head. Following several flickers of radiance, it crashed to the ground like a shot bird.</p><p>As for the flower basket, it had transformed into white mist and was already in pursuit of the wolf. In a second, it had caught up to the wolf and enveloped it. With a whistle from Han Li, it flew back into his hand and returned to its original form.</p><p>Having just recovered their magic treasures, the Bone Sage and Wu Chou gazed at Han Li in astonishment. Their expressions displayed complete disbelief.</p><p>Wu Chou was the first to awake and immediately wore a flustered, embarrassed expression. This was far beyond his expectations! He had originally thought that acquiring this ownerless treasure would be an easy matter with his Profound Yin Arts. He hadn&#x2019;t expected that the Bone Sage would contend with him for the treasure before either realized that the treasure itself was quite difficult to capture. Just as he was about to use another magic treasure, the wolf had been easily captured by Han Li, leaving Wu Chou in a hapless state of miserable, impotent fury.</p><p>The Bone Sage wore an odd expression when he came to his senses. Although he soon returned to being expressionless, Han Li caught a glimpse of anger from his eyes. In addition, the old devil felt somewhat baffled when he saw the copper bands suddenly appear on the silver wolf&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Han Li didn&#x2019;t have the time to muse over the Bone Sage&#x2019;s expressions. Instead, he excitedly glanced into the flower basket.</p><p>The copper bands seemed to be the bane of the silver wolf. They tightly restrained it, preventing it from moving in the slightest and binding it so that only its small head could be seen. It appeared rather pitiful.</p><p>Han Li chucked and lightly rubbed the wolf&apos;s head without a second thought. His hand then shined with azure light and completely enveloped it. Soon, the silver wolf&#x2019;s body weakened before it eventually faded away to a jade scepter.</p><p>Just as Han Li had acquired the scepter with delight, Qing Yi and Zenith Yin looked at the scene with astonishment, having just lost their treasure to Wan Tianming.</p><p>Zenith Yin inwardly frowned. He couldn&#x2019;t do anything about it now as he was facing such a great adversary as Wan Tianming. Moreover, there was no problem with giving Han Li possession of the treasure for now. After all, how could a junior possibly keep such an valuable ancient treasure that possessed its own illusory body. After this was all over, he would naturally have Han Li sincerely give it to his master.</p><p>Having settled his thoughts, Zenith Yin turned his attention back to Wan Tianming. The Heavensifting Mine was a Nascent Soul weapon of rarely seen ferocity. He was forced to be particularly focused when facing it.</p><p>But unfortunately, no action had been taken in the end. The stone platform suddenly shuddered with astonishing intensity as if it were about to cave in.</p><p>At that moment, a sliver of blue flame had finally reached beyond the hole.</p><p>Although only a small bit of the flame was exposed, in that same instant, a magnificent blue light blossomed, permeating throughout the entire stone platform. With the sounds of light crackling, a layer of blue frost also began to quickly spread across the ground.</p><p>Frightened, Han Li instantly reacted, shooting into the air. The Bone Sage had also acted quickly, flying into the air at nearly the same time as Han Li</p><p>However, Wu Chou hesitated for a moment and in that mere moment, the blue frost had already spread over his feet. The Profound Yin Qi hovering around his body was unable to protect him in the slightest. At that moment, Wu Chou became fearful and promptly wished to fly, but his feet were already frozen to the ground and the frost continued to spread. Wu Chou yelled in fright as he watched the frost cover his feet, and spread up from his lower leg.</p><p>As Han Li and the Bone Sage watched this from up above, they couldn&#x2019;t help but glance at each other with horror.</p><p>Just as Wu Chou was about to turn into an ice sculpture by the blue frost, a thin line of black light abruptly shot down from the sky. It struck Wu Chou&#x2019;s body, melting away the blue frost in a blaze of black fire and blue smoke.</p><p>Wu Chou rejoiced. He hastily flew to the skies with an expression of salvation upon regaining his freedom.</p><p>At that moment, he heard a cold snort transmitted to his ear followed by an irritated voice, &#x201C;Be careful. Next time, I might not have the chance to save you.&#x201D;</p><p>His survival had been the result of Zenith Yin&#x2019;s actions. He had used his Heavenvoid Corpsefire to save Wu Chou from the sky.</p><p>At that moment, the eccentrics of both sides stared at the blue flames coming from the hole without blinking. Each of them had varying expressions of interest, greed and even nervousness.</p><p>Zenith Yin&#x2019;s recent rescue of Wu Chou had been but a casual action. He hadn&#x2019;t even turned his head when he spoke to him. He simply licked his lips and gazed at the altar&#x2019;s hole with a feverish expression.</p><p>The rank one hidden treasure for countless years in the Scattered Star Seas, the Heavenvoid Cauldron, was about to emerge in the presence of these Nascent Soul cultivators at that very moment. Even the gloomy Zenith Yin and the other expressionless eccentrics couldn&#x2019;t help but have their attention captured by the emerging blue flames. It was no wonder why Zenith Yin had spoken to Wu Chou with such an irritated tone after he rescued him.</p><p>As the Bloodjade Spider and the fire pythons had been trembling from exhaustion for a while now, the eccentrics watched them from the sky with worry. However, none of them dared to assist the beasts in the slightest since the hole&#x2019;s surroundings had already become a world of blue light. While the red lights emitting from the spirit beasts&#x2019; bodies were able to repel the chilling light, the eccentrics were both unwilling and incapable of descending to assist the three spirit beasts.</p><p>As for the Core Formation cultivators, they had already distanced themselves a hundred meters from the hole and were watching the spectacle from a distance.</p>
