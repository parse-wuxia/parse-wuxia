It&#x2019;s enough as long as it can slightly raise this disciple&#x2019;s cultivating speed in Foundation Establishment. I will definitely not pick and choose!&#x201D; Han Li said very sincerely.</span></p><p><span style="">After a certain conversation with the small old man from whom Han Li had learned about the circumstances behind pill formulas in the cultivating world, he racked his brains on how to obtain a few pill formulas for his own uses. After all, he owned a secret technique for ripening medicinal herbs; how could he not exploit this advantage as much as he could!</span></p><p><span style="">However, the slightly better pill formulas all landed in the hands of Core Formation cultivators; even if Foundation Establishment disciples had one or two pill formulas, they could only refine insignificant medicine pills. Thus, his original plan was based off of his master, Li Huayuan, but since he had run into this Martial Senior Lei, Han Li immediately changed the target of his plan.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how one looked at it, this Martial Senior Lei was easier to manipulate than that master of his.</span></p><p><span style="">This was not merely Han Li&#x2019;s intuition; Li Huayuan was truly too stingy towards this in-name disciple of his. In addition, he was even more demanding and restricting because of their master-disciple relationship.</span></p><p><span style="">Most likely, if today&#x2019;s methods had been used on Li Huayuan, Han Li&#x2019;s master would only need to make an understatement and say, &#x201C;Good filial piety!&#x201D;, taking away these two spiritual medicines in a justified way. Han Li would have to act as if he had been moved to tears and thank his master for kindly accepting his offering.</span></p><p><span style="">Now, with great difficulty, he had finally encountered another Core Formation cultivator, so naturally he wanted to seize this rare opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You want to exchange medicinal formulas? This truly is a very tricky matter.&#x201D; Lei Wanhe&#x2019;s expression finally eased up after he seemingly thought of something. Then, his eyebrows became tightly knit, as if he were uncertain about it!</span></p><p><span style="">Upon seeing this, Han Li did not feel disappointed; in fact, he began to yell &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a chance!&#x201D; in his heart. Otherwise, this Martial Senior Lei would not have this kind of an expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As long as it&#x2019;s useful to this disciple, any pill formula is fine; Martial Nephew won&#x2019;t make things difficult for Martial Senior!&#x201D; Han Li hurriedly lowered his demands a notch.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Martial Nephew Han! Martial Senior does have some pretty good pill formulas, but these things are all the foundational, secretly transmitted formulas that only my clan possesses; I truly cannot bring them out to exchange with you!&#x201D; Lei Wanhe said with regret, shaking his head.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li was incredibly disappointed after hearing this! He didn&#x2019;t attempt to cover up any of his emotions, so when the fatty noticed this, he began to laugh and said:</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Although I cannot exchange my clan&#x2019;s pill formulas with you, I still have a few ancient formulas on hand! Some I found within historical ruins, while others I obtained by exchanging with friends. There&#x2019;d be no problem if I were to exchange them with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Really? Then this disciple thanks Martial Senior!&#x201D; Han Li hurriedly thanked with joy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait until I finish speaking, it&#x2019;s still too early to thank me!&#x201D; the fatty interjected disapprovingly, waving his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since we are going to make an exchange, as a Martial Senior, I need to make one thing clear,&#x201D; the fatty said seriously, causing Han Li to be startled slightly!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please, Martial Senior, say it; this disciple will definitely listen to your teachings!&#x201D; Han Li immediately answered respectfully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean listening to my teachings? I want to tell you the bad news first before you regret it in the future!&#x201D; Lei Wanhe glanced at Han Li and added indifferently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you follow these ancient formulas to refine medicinal pills, the result will all be genuine top-grade spiritual pills. But most importantly, the ingredients of these pill formulas are truly too difficult to find! I don&#x2019;t know if you will be able to obtain these items. Of course, although these ingredients are difficult to find, they definitely do exist in this realm. It&#x2019;s not the same as some other ancient formulas, where the ingredients have already gone extinct for an unknown number of years! In reality, many of the newly researched pill formulas are only the results of testing many ancient formulas with substitute ingredients, so although the ingredients for refining pills are there, the pills&#x2019; effectiveness decreased significantly. This is truly something that the cultivation world can do nothing about!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The fatty&#x2019;s words shocked Han Li multiple times upon hearing them. However, he still understood the other person&#x2019;s meaning.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Martial Senior&#x2019;s meaning is?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very easy; after you obtain the pill formulas, if you truly can&#x2019;t find all the ingredients to refine the pills, look for a substitute and try it out. Who knows, there might be a chance you&#x2019;ll succeed!&#x201D; the fatty solemnly said to Han Li. </span></p><p><span style="">When Han Li heard this, he was speechless! However, he was clear in his heart that this Martial Senior probably felt that the ingredients for the pill formulas he was about to exchange for were truly too difficult to obtain. Most likely, he felt somewhat sorry; thus, he gave Han Li a reminder!</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed in this way that Martial Senior Lei&#x2019;s integrity was not too bad! Han Li secretly thought this, but he nonetheless put on a lovable outward appearance, repeatedly saying &#x201C;okay&#x201D;, demonstrating that he was not considering backing out from the exchange!</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing this, Lei Wanhe was extremely happy in his heart. He still felt that he had taken advantage of this Martial Nephew too much and felt somewhat sorry! After thinking for a moment, he spoke once again:</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about this, you have two spiritual herbs here! We&#x2019;ll exchange one herb for one formula! This Martial Senior can&#x2019;t let you take too much of a loss!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Han Li heard this, he stared blankly for a moment! However, immediately afterward he began to exult with joy, and his positive feeling for this Martial Senior Lei instantly increased greatly!</span></p><p><span style="">He repeatedly thanked Lei Wanhe; this time, Han Li said it out of complete sincerity without any pretense!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Enough. This is the list of pill formulas. Pick two! All of the medicinal pill attributes and the necessary ingredients are listed in there. When you have finished picking, I will give you the actual pill formulas!&#x201D; Saying this, the fatty pulled out a jade slip and tossed it towards Han Li.</span></p><p><span style="">When Han Li excitedly received this item, he felt that something was strange! When had this Martial Senior prepared this catalog!?</span></p><p><span style="">But this question only flashed briefly in the back of his mind. Han Li received the jade slip, then very carefully scanned it, looking for any appropriate pill formulas.</span></p><p><span style="">This Spirit Gathering Pill and this Qi Refining Powder!&#x201D; Han Li retrieved his consciousness from the jade slip then excitedly exclaimed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Spirit Gathering Pill, Qi Refining Powder?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The fatty indifferently nodded his head after hearing this and didn&#x2019;t say anything. He immediately pulled out two more jade slips from his storage pouch and tossed them out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Alright, it&#x2019;s no longer early; I should be heading back!&#x201D; The fatty happily stored the spiritual herbs on the table, then immediately said his goodbyes and left. Now that he had gathered all his ingredients, he hurried back to refine his own Soul Strengthening Pill!</span></p><p><span style="">Upon hearing this, Han Li hurriedly stood up to escort him out.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when Han Li was escorting him to the cave entrance, he suddenly remembered something. He then asked the other person about the whereabouts and cave location of his master, Li Huayuan.</span></p><p><span style="">When the fatty heard that Han Li was actually Li Huayuan&#x2019;s in-name disciple, his shock was not small; however, he still told Han Li the location, then flew away on a streak of silver light.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li watched Lei Wanhe completely disappear before happily pulling out the jade slips with the pill formulas on them, playing around with them for a while. After a long time, he turned around, wanting to return to his cave!</span></p><p><span style="">However, Han Li had only taken two steps before an object near the cave attracted his attention. With a glance, it was actually Senior Martial Brother Lin&#x2019;s body lying on the ground, curled up; it even preserved the posture of having been thrown out by the fatty.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li started for a moment, then walked towards it without hesitation. When he reached the corpse, he bent down and began to search.</span></p><p><span style="">He remembered very clearly that Martial Senior Lei had not touched anything on the corpse. He didn&#x2019;t know whether it was because he was too ashamed to do it in front of a junior like him, or if the items of a Foundation Establishment disciple simply couldn&#x2019;t enter his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected, Han Li found a storage pouch on the corpse&#x2019;s waist.</span></p><p><span style="">This caused Han Li to begin to grin widely! After all, he was very interested in those puppets; the other person&#x2019;s storage pouch should have a huge pile of them!</span></p><p><span style="">But when Han Li examined the storage pouch, the smile on his face gradually disappeared. The storage pouch actually did not have a single puppet inside of it! Apart from a few spirit stones and two bottles of regular medicinal pills, there was only an unassuming jade slip inside. This caused Han Li&#x2019;s fired up mood to immediately be extinguished!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He clearly controlled so many puppets that day. How could all of them have disappeared&#x2026;could they all have been destroyed?&#x201D; Han Li muttered to himself with an unhappy expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li&#x2019;s guess was actually pretty much correct.</span></p><p><span style="">On that day, Senior Martial Brother Lin had controlled numerous puppets and was able to fight evenly with his opponents. However, when the quadruplets from the Thousand Bamboo Sect killed the two escaping cultivators, they hurried over to harass him. Senior Martial Brother Lin, seeing that the circumstances were not good, immediately detonated all of his puppets. He then took advantage of the confusion and rushed out into the forest. Thus, not even a single mechanical puppet could be found in his storage pouch!</span></p><p><span style="">In his disappointment, Han Li carelessly pulled out that jade slip. Then, as if it were a routine, he sent his consciousness into it, then carelessly gave it a few cursory glances.</span></p><p><span style="">All of a sudden, Han Li&#x2019;s eyes greatly widened, and the lazy expression on his face instantly froze.</span></p><p><span style="">This was because as soon as his divine sense entered the jade slip, three golden words emerged: &#x201C;Great Development Technique&#x201D;!</span></p><p></p></div><p></p>
