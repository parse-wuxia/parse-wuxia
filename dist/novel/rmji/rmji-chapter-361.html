<p><strong>Chapter 361: Mishap</strong></p><p>As Han Li stomped on his Divine Wind Boat with one arm wrapped around the masked woman, Dong Xuan&#x2019;er blocked his way while covered in pink light.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior Martial Sister Dong, must you act?&#x201D; Han Li lightly sighed and spoke grudgingly.</p><p>Her eyes coldly glinted as she glanced down at the unconscious masked woman in Han Li&#x2019;s embrace. Dong Xuan&#x2019;er expressionlessly said, &#x201C;Han Li, if you wish to leave, you must first pass through me! I have always been curious as to why my Master Hong Fu had insisted on marrying me to you!</p><p>&#x201C;Also, did you really expect me to allow a Masked Moon Core Formation cultivator to easily escape?&#x201D; Dong Xuan&#x2019;er&#x2019;s refined brow gradually frowned, and she wore a baleful expression.</p><p>Once she finished, Han Li didn&#x2019;t reply with words regarding old affection or other such nonsense. After all, he had used formation flags to hastily trap the other two within a simple illusion formation. It wouldn&#x2019;t keep them trapped for long.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s expression sunk and he said, &#x201C;Since it&#x2019;s like this, then don&#x2019;t blame me for being ruthless, Young Lady Dong!&#x201D;</p><p>Han Li then loudly yelled and waved his hand, releasing two black lights and five streaks of white light. In addition, a tortoise shell appeared beside him and blocked his front. Afterwards, four puppet beasts appeared at both his sides. With gaping mouths, they shot out light beams as thick as a bowl.</p><p>He took action with the entirety of his power. He didn&#x2019;t have any notion of going easy on the fairer sex.</p><p>Once Dong Xuan&#x2019;er saw Han Li&#x2019;s ferocious offensive, her expression underwent great change.</p><p>She grit her teeth and waved her flawless hand, summoning a pink muslin cloth. Her hands then emitted a red-orange glow which combined with her muslin cloth to form a huge barrier of sparkling red light surrounding herself.</p><p>Dong Xuan&#x2019;er was convinced that even if Han Li&#x2019;s attack was more overbearing, it still wouldn&#x2019;t be able to break through the powerful barrier created from her &#x201C;Fire Phoenix Cloth&#x201D; and devilish arts.</p><p>As Dong Xuan&#x2019;er was basking in confidence, Han Li&#x2019;s Divine Wind Boat flashed with white light and streaked past her with a woosh.</p><p>Likewise, the magic tools that were in an overbearing attack made an immediate turn and quickly flew after Han Li.</p><p>Without fighting for even a moment, Han Li had instead used his attack as a misdirection, allowing for an immediately escape.</p><p>This was completely out of Dong Xuan&#x2019;er&#x2019;s expectations! She blankly stood in place before her face deeply blushed. Just as she thought to furiously pursue Han Li, the four puppet beasts fired light beams on her.</p><p>Dong Xuan&#x2019;er could only wait until after the light beams faded away before hastily withdrawing her light barrier. But by that time, Han Li had already turned into a black dot in the distance and was about to disappear from sight.</p><p>Naturally, Dong Xuan&#x2019;er was unwilling to allow Han Li&#x2019;s trickery succeed. By making use of her wondrous movement technique, she ignored the four puppet beasts and set off in hot pursuit.</p><p>But a short moment later, that black dot in the sky flashed several more times and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>With a furious expression, Dong Xuan&#x2019;er swept the vicinity without finding a single trace of Han Li. She had no choice but to give up her pursuit of them and dejectedly return.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>At this moment, Han Li was hiding in a loose earth mound to rest. A yellow barrier of light covered Han Li from all sides, but it didn&#x2019;t feel stuffy at all. It was quite fantastic.</p><p>Han Li hadn&#x2019;t thought that this low grade &#x201C;Earthsink Talisman&#x201D;, would prove to be useful someday. It seems that keeping all the talismans he possessed on his body was a correct decision.</p><p>A moment later, he felt that Dong Xuan&#x2019;er had left. Without leaving concealment, he carefully used his spiritual sense and confirmed that Dong Xuan&#x2019;er truly wasn&#x2019;t there before leaving the earth mound and speedily flying away.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Many hours later, Han Li carried the masked woman into the dry hollow of a large tree. The tree hollow&#x2019;s previous master, a huge bear, was lying dismembered outside the cave.</p><p>Han Li gently lowered the masked woman to the ground and gripped her flawless wrist with deep concern, slowly releasing spiritual power into her blood vessels to take a look at her injuries.</p><p>However, Han Li regretted having done such a rash action immediately afterwards.</p><p>Upon pouring just a slight amount of spiritual power into her body, a huge attractive force suddenly appeared and caused Han Li&#x2019;s spiritual power to wildly flood into her like a dam had broken.</p><p>Han Li was greatly alarmed and attempted to let go, but he found that his hands were firmly stuck and was unable to break free. Unexpectedly, his other hand was also helplessly caught by this attractive force, causing his magic power to flow out at double the speed.</p><p>Han Li was aghast as he felt every drop of his bitterly cultivated true essence forcefully sucked out by the masked woman. To make matters worse, the attractive force only grew stronger as time passed, making Han Li lose his head from panic!</p><p>Not daring to repeat the same mistake by trying to by pushing her off with his legs, Han Li was at his wit&#x2019;s end as his hands continued to be rigidly stuck.</p><p>Han Li could only helplessly stare on as his mid Foundation Establishment cultivation degraded to early Foundation Establishment, and then as early Foundation Establishment fell into Qi Condensation, and...</p><p>As he felt his heart bleed, Han Li found that he could not longer endure and his gaze blackened before he fainted and fell onto the body of the masked woman.</p><p>&#x201C;Fragrant... and soft!&#x201D; Before Han Li lost consciousness, this single lustful thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>As such, a man and a woman were intimately tangled with one another in a quiet cave. But since both of them were were unconscious, Han Li&#x2019;s spiritual power still continued to slowly and uncontrollably flow into the woman&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Han Li eventually woke up in a daze.</p><p>But just as he drowsily opened his eyes, Han Li found himself looking at an attractive, slender silhouette standing outside the tree cave, surveying the scene outside with her back facing Han Li.</p><p>Han Li blankly looked on for a moment before feeling a severe headache. After holding back his voice with great difficulty, he recalled the event before he passed out. Fearful, Han Li hastily used his spiritual sense to examine his body.</p><p>His felt his heart drop to the deepest depths. Not only did his cultivation revert back to Qi Condensation, it had dropped to the third layer. He was left completely dumbfounded as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>While Han Li was at a loss, the slender woman softly asked without turning her head, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re awake?&#x201D;</p><p>Han Li woke from his stupor, and with an unsightly expression, he couldn&#x2019;t help but furiously ask, &#x201C;Nangong Wan, what happened? I saved you with good intentions yet you absorbed my magic power.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nangong Wan? You know my elder cousin?&#x201D; The woman finally turned around. She had already taken off her hood, allowing Han Li to clearly see her face.</p><p>Han Li was shocked!</p><p>Although her extremely beautiful appearance was quite similar to Nangong Wan, her delicate oval face along with her delicate eyebrows were completely unfamiliar to Han Li.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you? How is this possible? I clearly heard the Devil Dao cultivators called you &#x2018;Senior Nangong! And your voice...&#x201D; Han Li blankly murmured to himself in complete confusion.</p><p>But suddenly, his complexion turned deathly pale and couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to speak further.</p><p>This was because he finally recalled the clear but subtle difference between this woman&#x2019;s voice and Nangong Wan&#x2019;s voice. Her voice was more hoarse. At the time, he had believed that Nangong Wan was severely injured, causing her voice to change as a result. However, this oversight had caused this mishap to occur. Not only did he mistakenly rescue someone, but his cultivation had been sucked dry by the person he rescued.</p><p>Over ten years of bitter cultivation had completely disappeared in a day!</p><p>As Han Li felt both dismay and dejection, his complexion alternated between red and white.</p><p>This female cultivator, who claimed to be Nangong Wan&#x2019;s younger cousin, gave Han Li a dignified smile and said something that left him stunned. &#x201C;Are you Yellow Maple Valley&#x2019;s Han Li?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How does Senior know my name?&#x201D; Han Li&#x2019;s spirit strongly shook. Since he saw that this woman had no intentions of killing him and with reassuring thoughts of the &#x2018;Three Essence Revolutions Technique&#x2019;, he managed to calm down.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Cousin and I are as close as sisters. We hide nothing from each other. She had spoken to me about your previous incident!&#x201D; The woman&#x2019;s expression was indifferent; neither joy nor anger could be made out.</p><p>Han Li was speechless.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you know? When I found out about this incident, my first thought was to run over to Yellow Maple Valley and dismember you into eight pieces, feeding your corpse to the dogs!&#x201D; The woman&#x2019;s eyes suddenly flashed with cold light. Her words were filled with a murderous tone, leaving Han Li pale.</p>
