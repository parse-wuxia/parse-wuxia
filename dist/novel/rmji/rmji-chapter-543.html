<p><strong>Chapter 543: Jadefire Wine</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Fellow Daoist, please sit!&#x201D; The demon cultivator boldly took a seat and beckoned to Han Li.</p><p>Han Li took a seat across from the demon cultivator and remained silent.</p><p>The demon cultivator narrowed his eyes and gently said, &#x201C;It seems I&#x2019;ve embarrassed myself. I still haven&#x2019;t asked for your esteemed name. My name is Feng Xi.&#x201D;</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Han Li slowly said, &#x201C;My surname is Li!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, so it&#x2019;s Fellow Daoist Li. You must feel somewhat confused. In truth, if any other cultivator had appeared before me, I would&#x2019;ve definitely slain them despite not being from the local sea race. Peaceful coexistence between humans and demons is certainly impossible.&#x201D;</p><p>Han Li felt his heart tremble and forced a smile, asking, &#x201C;In that case, does Senior Feng see something different about Junior?&#x201D;</p><p>Feng Xi&#x2019;s eyes flickered with green light. He slowly said, &#x201C;You are only a mid Core Formation cultivator, yet you dared to bravely enter so deeply into the seas, relying on that marvelous Qi Restraint Technique of yours!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Qi Restraint Technique?&#x201D; Han Li paused for a moment, suddenly recalling the nameless incantation in the hide book.</p><p>Feng Xi wore an odd expression and said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, I am somewhat familiar with your Qi Restraint Technique. I saw it from an old friend of mine, but strangely enough, that technique is something that was secretly passed down. How are you, a human cultivator, capable of using it?&#x201D;</p><p>Han Li couldn&#x2019;t easily mention the matter of the hide book and remained silent for a while, not knowing how to respond.</p><p>When Feng Xi looked at Han Li&#x2019;s expression, he leaned back into his chair and smiled. He then casually said, &#x201C;There is no need for Fellow Daoist to be worried. My old friend has been dead for many years, and I&#x2019;m not looking for an explanation. I am merely curious about how a human can use a secret demon race technique. The main reason why I haven&#x2019;t attacked you is actually because you cultivate a pure wood attribute cultivation art. Otherwise, you&#x2019;d already be dead.&#x201D;</p><p>Han Li revealed amazement. He was truly shocked to hear that the main reason he wasn&#x2019;t attacked was because of the attribute of his cultivation art.</p><p>When Feng Xi saw Han Li&#x2019;s shocked expression, he said nothing and waved his arms instead, summoning a simple gold pot with a flash of white light.</p><p>He then took a jade wine cup and poured a dark green liquid into it. In the blink of an eye, the concentrated smell of alcohol spread throughout the hall.</p><p>The human-form demon beast then took a deep breath and wore an infatuated expression on his face. He flicked the cup with his finger, smoothly sliding the jade cup over to Han Li.</p><p>Feng Xi stared at Han Li and deeply said, &#x201C;Fellow Daoist Li, take a taste of my Jadefire Wine. I made it myself. It is a genuine spirit wine that takes over a hundred years to ferment, and provides slight gains towards cultivation. Perhaps Fellow Daoist could even use this opportunity to break through his bottleneck!&#x201D;</p><p>When Han Li heard this, he paused in surprise before staring down at the green liquid in the cup. The demon cultivator was able to tell that his cultivation was stuck at a bottleneck, his abilities are truly remarkable. But Han Li found it dubious that the wine could help him break through his bottleneck.</p><p>He had consumed no small number of medicine pills for cultivation progression. If he could break through the cultivation bottleneck with medicinal power, he would&#x2019;ve already cultivated to the ninth layer of the Azure Essence Sword Art. Furthermore, as he had no idea about what the other party intended, he didn&#x2019;t dare to casually drink the wine.</p><p>As these thoughts churned through his mind, Han Li&#x2019;s face revealed hesitation.</p><p>A cold glint shone within the demon cultivator&#x2019;s eyes. His expression grew sullen upon seeing Han Li&#x2019;s hesitation and he coldly said, &#x201C;What? Are you scared that I did something to the wine. Don&#x2019;t forget, if I wanted to take your life, it would only take me an instant!&#x201D;</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s face paled and his gaze fell upon the wine cup. He then summoned the courage to say, &#x201C;Senior is correct. However, Junior wishes to figure something out first: the true reason why Senior hasn&#x2019;t killed me. Junior will be ill at ease until he understands.&#x201D;</p><p>It had became obvious that the demon cultivator wished for Han Li to drink the wine. As a result, Han Li&#x2019;s doubts only became greater.</p><p>Feng Xi felt somewhat surprised and an icy expression soon appeared on his face. His body released an eerie aura.</p><p>Han Li felt his heart drop and the true essence in his body wrapped around the Celestial Ice Pearl in his body. He cautiously stared at the demon cultivator in silence.</p><p>A short moment later, Feng Xi frowned and his expression relaxed.</p><p>After muttering to himself for a moment, Feng Xi said with a low voice, &#x201C;It seems by not telling Fellow Daoist the specifics, he has misunderstood my good intentions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This Jadefire Wine is not only difficult to refine and takes a hundred years to ferment, but it also requires a metamorphosis stage demon core as its primary ingredient. Additionally, only Windbreaker Beasts are able to refine the wine. Even if other demon cultivators had the formula, they would be unable to refine the wine due to lacking the innate abilities. To me, this wine serves only to satisfy my tastes. But to a Core Formation cultivator such as yourself, it will stimulate the true essence in your body the first time you drink it, possibly allowing you to break through your current bottleneck. Of course, the only reason I am giving you so precious to Fellow Daoist Li is for my own gains. I require the assistance of your wood attribute cultivation arts for something very important. However, a mid Core Formation cultivation is too low. Even late Core Formation cultivation is still a bit lacking. But I see that your own cultivation arts are unordinary. You possess far deeper magic power than cultivators of a similar grade, and as a result, you will do, if just barely. It should now be quite obvious what consequences will follow if Fellow Daoist Li doesn&#x2019;t drink the wine!&#x201D;</p><p>Feng Xi knew that if he didn&#x2019;t give a clear explanation, Han Li wouldn&#x2019;t obediently follow his orders.</p><p>When Han Li heard this, his expression changed several times. A short moment later, he spoke with a hoarse voice, &#x201C;And if I drink this wine and can&#x2019;t breakthrough my bottleneck?&#x201D;</p><p>Feng Xi sneered and calmly said, &#x201C;Hehe! Then Fellow Daoist Li will no longer serve any purpose for me. Since my Jadefire Wine is quite difficult to refine, I will have to take your life as compensation!&#x201D;</p><p>Although Han Li had already suspected this, his face twitched after hearing the confirmation.</p><p>After a short moment of deliberation Han Li&#x2019;s face became resolute and he took a deep breath. &#x201C;Fine, I&#x2019;ll drink it!&#x201D;</p><p>Feng Xi suddenly wore a happy expression.</p><p>Han Li slapped his hand onto the table. Then with a flash of azure light, the dark green liquid from the cup flew into his mouth in a stream.</p><p>The liquid then dropped into his stomach without Han Li even tasting it.</p><p>&#x201C;Good. I knew Fellow Daoist Li would make the sensible decision. Follow me. I&#x2019;ve already prepared a quiet room for you.&#x201D; Feng Xi spoke with a satisfied expression and stood up before walking to the side of the hall.</p><p>Han Li wordlessly followed after him with a calm expression.</p><p>As Han Li followed the demon cultivator, he eventually found himself in front of a fire-red stone wall.</p><p>After some further examination, Han Li astonishingly discovered the sparkling red stone wall was actually a huge slab of cut coral rock. As Han Li pondered about it, Feng Xi lightly pushed the stone wall, revealing a three meter wide hole in a flash of white light.</p><p>Feng Xi pointed to the hole and tranquilly said, &#x201C;Refine the wine in this hidden room. According to my estimates, it should only take half a year at most to refine. Fellow Daoist should be able to succeed in that time. When the time arrives, I will release the restriction and allow you to come out.&#x201D;</p><p>Han Li took a glance before expressionlessly entering the hole. At this point, he naturally had no intention of further speaking with Feng Xi.</p><p>Just after Han Li walked in, the opening behind him disappeared.</p><p>Feng Xi stood outside the wall without immediately departing. He glanced at the wall with a face bizarrely full of excitement. A short moment later, he disappeared without a trace in a flash of white light.</p><p>Han Li was currently inspecting the so-called hidden room inside the coral wall. The room couldn&#x2019;t be considered small, at a hundred meters wide and over twenty meters tall. Apart from a glistening azure jade couch at the center of the room, there was nothing else.</p><p>But what was most baffling to Han Li were the countless small holes that filled the walls. They appeared just like bits of black sesame.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s face grew gloomy for a moment and he sat down on the jade couch in a cross-legged position. With his eyes closed, he slowly released his spiritual sense from his body.</p><p>After a short moment, he spread his spiritual sense across the room and was surprised to discover that the walls repelled it. Soon, he confirmed that there were no gaps that his spiritual sense was able to slip through.</p><p>Han Li then frowned, opening his eyes with a cold glint.</p><p>After some thought, Han Li sat up from the jade couch and walked towards a side of the room. He inspected the coral wall in front of him with narrowed eyes.</p><p>He extended a finger that glowed with blinding azure swordlight toward the wall. The light was only several inches long and continuously glistened.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>If you enjoy the translation, please consider supporting the novel on <a href="www.patreon.com">Patreon!</a> Every patron counts towards the translation speed goals, no matter how small!
