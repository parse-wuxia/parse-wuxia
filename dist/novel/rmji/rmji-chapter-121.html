<p><strong>Chapter 121 Clear River Brothel.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><b>Chapter 121: Clear River Brothel<br></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>Shen Zhongshan&#x2019;s current mood was quite good. He was currently sitting in a private room of the Clear River Brothel and embracing an exceptionally beautiful girl, using his large hands to grope her delicate body in a vulgar manner.</p><p>Maybe it was due to Shen Zhongshan&#x2019;s impatience, but his handling caused the gorgeously enchanting maiden to giggle nonstop.</p><p>&#x201C;Miss Jin, I think you should just submit to our Gang Leader already! This is the first time our Gang Leader has been so infatuated with a woman. He came here in such a hurry even though the gang&#x2019;s affairs have not been completely dealt with.&#x201D; The person who said this was a dark fatty who wore loose-fitting gray garments. His waist was as large as a bucket, and his legs were twice the size a normal person&#x2019;s. &#xA0;After speaking, he was somewhat gasping for breath.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, Miss Jinzhi! Our Gang Leader has visited your establishment every afternoon for five days in a row and spent a large sum of money! Furthermore, you profited quite a bit. You only let our Gang Leader embrace you for a while and never let him spend the night with you even once. This just doesn&#x2019;t make any sense!&#x201D; The one who spoke this time was a middle aged scholar with a mole on his face. His eyes exuded a hidden fierceness, making him seem like a scheming person.</p><p>Currently, besides Shen Zhongshan, there were three other people in the room. They were none other than Fourth Level Gang&#x2019;s three Great Protectors.</p><p>The dark fatty was &#x201C;Mad Fist&#x201D; Qian Jing. Disregarding his oddly plump size, he was actually extremely proficient in the &#x201C;Berserk Eighteen Strike&#x201D; and had killed many reputable experts.</p><p>The Confusian scholar was &#x201C;Malicious&#xA0;Scholar&#x201D; Fan Ju. Even though he practiced a very swift and fierce &#x201C;Snow Wind&#x201D; sword technique, what made his name famous worldwide was his dark heart, fierce methods, and sinister intentions.</p><p>Standing at one side was a dark-clothed person who had not spoken a word since the start. He was the strongest out of the three Great Protectors, &#x201C;Throwing Dagger&#x201D; Shen San. His unique skill of sending out eighteen throwing daggers in succession had previously helped Shen Zhongshan get rid of many experts who pursued a vendetta against him. In addition, Shen San was also Shen Zhongshan&#x2019;s distant relative. Thus, he was the one Shen Zhongshan regarded the most highly in the Fourth Level Gang.</p><p>Just like Shen Zhongshan, each of the three Protectors had a pretty girl sitting in their embrace. But these girls were nothing like the girl in Shen Zhongshan&#x2019;s embrace. She was delicate, charming, flirtatious and finely developed in figure.</p><p>At this moment, when the giggling little Jinzhi heard &#x201C;Mad Fist&#x201D; and &#x201C;Malicious&#xA0;Scholar&#x201D; Fan Ju&#x2019;s words, her eyes immediately began to tear up, as if a teardrop might fall at any moment.</p><p>&#x201C;When Master Fan and Master Qian speak like this, you are wrongly accusing Jinzhi. The moment others see Master Shen, they would immediately know that he is a hero! To be able to fly together and nest together with Master Shen, that is all that Jinzhi wishes for!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, both of you also know that my body belongs to Clear River Brothel. Without the brothel&#x2019;s Elderly Lady Wang&#x2019;s approval, if Jinzhi were to leave and receive patrons without permission, I will be beaten to death. Why doesn&#x2019;t Master Shen go and ask Elderly Lady Wang? If she agrees to let Jinzhi receive patrons, then I will definitely wait upon Master Shen diligently tonight.&#x201D; The lead prostitute of the Clear River Brothel spoke in a sincere tone of sweet reasonableness and looked at Shen Zhongshan with extreme adoration.</p><p>Her words seemed quite believable yet fake at the same time, making Qian Jin and Fan Ju look at each other speechlessly in dismay.</p><p>Of course they had asked for the price of spending the night with little Jinzhi. Using the excuse of little Jinzhi having never spent the night with a patron before, Elderly Lady Wang demanded an exorbitant price that made Gang Leader Shen Zhongshan&#x2019;s heart skip a beat. Thus, they had never reached an agreement.</p><p>It was even more impossible to use force to negotiate. The Clear River Brothel was the property of Jia Yuan City&#x2019;s third largest gang, the Heavenly Tyrant Sect.</p><p>After hitting a snag with this giant red card, Qian Jin and Fan Ju could only vent their frustration on the Clear River Brothel&#x2019;s girls who were in their arms. Only after groping them ferociously did they let the matter drop.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, many thanks to the two worthy little brothers for being concern about my affairs. But don&#x2019;t worry, two days ago I made a great business deal. This small amount of money isn&#x2019;t too much. On the contrary, you, beautiful lady, cannot go back on your words! You must properly wait upon this Lord Master when the time comes!&#x201D; The lustful&#xA0;Shen Zhongshan said contentedly as he suddenly turned towards little Jinzhi, who was in his embrace, and nibbled her fragrant cheek.</p><p>Shen Zhongshan was a huge man with very hairy arms and chest. His two arms were much longer than that of an average human. Thus, his whole person looked like a beast wearing clothes, truly so ugly that he could frighten people.</p><p>A few years ago, this extremely boorish man used &#x201C;Open Arm Punch&#x201D;, a skill that he mastered to perfection, to kill the Fourth Level Gang&#x2019;s predecessor, Gou Tianpo, and his trusted aides, the four great Warlords, thereby seizing the position as Gang Leader. Therefore, in the entire Jia Yuan City, he was definitely a part of the top ranking experts and must not be underestimated.</p><p>&#x201C;Master Shen&#x201D;, Little Jinzhi appeared very bashful when Shen Zhongshan sneakily bit her cheek and behaved like a spoiled child in his arms, making Shen Zhongshan quite pleased with himself as he laughed heartily.</p><p><i>Dong dong! Dong dong!</i> Right in that moment, someone knocked on the door.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D; The dark fatty, &#x201C;Mad Fist&#x201D; Qian Jin was unhappy and shouted out the question in a bad mood.</p><p>&#x201C;I am here to deliver beverages to the gentlemen in the room.&#x201D; The voice of a youthful male came through from the outside.</p><p>&#x201C;Then why are you taking so slow to deliver? I&#x2019;ve already complained that there are not enough drinks!&#x201D; The dark fatty spoke without thinking when he heard the reply.</p><p>In the wake of Qian Jin&#x2019;s words, a young man wearing servant clothes came in. The ordinary-looking youth was holding a tray with both hands. There were several dishes and two bottles of alcohol on the tray.</p><p>&#x201C;Quickly bring the alcohol here. I want to see how it tastes like!&#x201D; Fatty Qian Jin was a typical drunkard. Thus his eyes immediately brightened up and he clamoured incessantly when he saw the two bottles of alcohol.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, this servant will carry it to you!&#x201D; This person, with an appearance of a young servant, walked forward a few steps and placed a wine cup on the table.</p><p>The moment the fatty saw the wine cup, he immediately grabbed it in his hand and wanted to down it to taste its flavour.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait, fatty!&#x201D; The quiet black-clothed person, Shen San, suddenly stopped Qian Jin from pouring the alcohol into his mouth.</p><p></p><div style="margin: 8px 0px"><p></p><p></p></div><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
