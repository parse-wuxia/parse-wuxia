<p><strong>Chapter 349: Fleeing to Yuanwu&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Immediately after Han Li and company heard Martial Uncle Huang&#x2019;s voice, the Cloud-Wind Banner suddenly flashed with blinding yellow light. The burst of radiance contracted and then swelled before exploding.</p><p>A white mist even thicker than before madly rushed forth from the banner and enveloped both enemies and allies in the blink of an eye.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re courting death!&#x201D;</p><p>A roar from the human skeleton traveled through the fog along with the furious, charming voice of the seductive woman. Afterwards, the sound of huge explosions started echoing through the mist. It was obvious that Martial Uncle Huang was currently fighting with the two Devil Dao Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Han Li and company didn&#x2019;t allow this opportunity provided by their Martial Uncle to slip by. At nearly the same moment that the mist appeared, the Yellow Maple Valley cultivators scattered in all directions, flying off on their magic tools.</p><p>Relying on the Divine Wind Boat&#x2019;s great speed, Han Li shot through the fog.</p><p>Han Li chose to flee in the direction that held the most enemy cultivators. Although the enemies there were numerous, Han Li felt that their magic power and cultivation was weaker, thereby being the best direction to break through.</p><p>However, many of his fellow sect members didn&#x2019;t understand this, and the majority of them chose the directions that held fewer enemies. Han Li could only look on with disapproval.</p><p>In an instant, Han Li had taken advantage of the chaotic situation to arrive at the edge of the encirclement.</p><p>The mist at the edge of the enclosure was much weaker, allowing the Devil Dao cultivators to notice Han Li&#x2019;s rushing figure. But because Han Li was using the Azurefire Miasma, they were only able to see a large cloud of azure-red smoke, leaving them stunned.</p><p>However, three nearby Devil Dao cultivators immediately came to their senses and simultaneously launched their attacks. A streak of golden light, three streaks of yellow light, and a large ball of black Qi shot toward Han Li&#x2019;s direction.</p><p>Han Li snorted and pointed to the tortoise shell, causing it to immediately swell to several times its original size. At that same moment, he madly poured more spiritual power into the Divine Wind Boat in an attempt to fly as fast as possible.</p><p>Han Li had already come to the conclusion that now was not the time to be tangled up in a battle. If other enemies were allowed to ensnare him, he would no longer be able to run. Therefore, he poured most of his magic power into his flying magic tool as it was a race against time to escape. This was only possible due to the great confidence Han Li had in his tortoise shell as it was even harder than his white scale shield.</p><p>While Han Li was still thinking, the golden and yellow streaks of light collided with the tortoise shell. Just as Han Li had expected, they were forcibly blocked. However, the ball of black Qi was unexpectedly tricky, and it suddenly split in two when it smashed against the tortoise shell. The halves slipped around the sides of the tortoise shell before reforming. Although it had been delayed for a moment, it still arrived at Han Li&#x2019;s side. The ball of black Qi turned into a ten-meter-large ghost head, attempting to swallow Han Li along with his Divine Wind Boat.</p><p>Han Li sneered in response. With a single wave of his arm, over a hundred fireballs appeared, tearing the ghost head apart in an instant. Over the course of the war, Han Li had grown quite familiar with such elementary Devil Dao arts.</p><p>Taking advantage of the opening, Han Li exhaled and sped past the evaporated ghost head. In an instant, he had broken through the enclosure, leaving the Devil Dao cultivators behind him.</p><p>Although their attacks were not successful, the Devil Dao cultivators were naturally unwilling to just let him go. They cursed before hastily chasing after Han Li on their own flying magic tools. However, Han Li didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to his pursuers, only focusing on flying at the greatest speed possible.</p><p>As Han Li expected, the curses of the Devil Dao cultivators sounded further away and rarer as time passed. Flight magic tools capable of such speed as the Divine Wind Boat were seldom seen after all. Finally, after a mad rush lasting a few hours, not a single person could be seen behind him.</p><p>Even with this, Han Li still didn&#x2019;t dare to grow complacent and continued speeding along for a moment before slowing down and carefully examining his surroundings. He then stamped his foot on his Divine Wind boat, shooting away once more.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s current condition wasn&#x2019;t very good. Almost half of his magic power had been consumed in the creation of the united defensive barrier. With the additional magic power consumed during his mad rush, he was in dire need to replenish his magic power! Otherwise, he would be in dire straits if he were to encounter an enemy.</p><p>With that in mind, Han Li descended onto a desolate mountain and put away his Azurefire Miasma. He then found a concealed location behind a huge rock and sat down cross-legged behind it.</p><p>Afterwards, he took out a blue mid-grade spirit stone from his storage pouch and started to replenish his magic power.</p><p>Crooked Soul stood by his side and kept watch.</p><p>Not long after Han Li sat down, a streak of red light flew across the sky in a panic. Soon after, six streaks of black and green light chased after it.</p><p>It was obvious that an unlucky person had managed to get snared a second time.</p><p>Han Li didn&#x2019;t pay further attention to them and slowly closed his eyes, his mind sinking into a state of emptiness to recover magic power at even greater speed.</p><p>After an indeterminate length of time had passed, Han Li opened his eyes. Having nearly recovered the entirety of his magic power, he was unwilling to stay here for even a second longer.</p><p>He looked up at the sky and saw that it was now dusk; he was just in time to make his escape under the cover of night.</p><p>However, Han Li didn&#x2019;t make any haphazard movements. Instead, he took a moment to carefully observe his surroundings with his spiritual sense and confirmed that there were no Devil Dao cultivators nearby.</p><p>It seemed that they were now pursuing the main Yellow Maple Valley group, after having dealt with the failed ambush.</p><p>With the enemy&#x2019;s strength in mind, Han Li shook his head. Everything pointed to disaster for the main group.</p><p>Han Li gave it no more thought and released his Divine Wind Boat. After making sure of the direction to the State of Yuanwu, Han Li and Crooked Soul took off.</p><p>Although a majority of the cultivators from the State of Yuanwu had met their end in the State of Yue, it would still take several months for the Six Devil Dao sects to fully conquer the State of Yue. For the time being, the State of Yuanwu could still be considered safe.</p><p>Han Li didn&#x2019;t plan to go to the meeting location and assemble with the main group. The main group may have already been pursued by the Devil Dao; to go there now would just be looking for more trouble.</p><p>Furthermore, Han Li could take advantage of this opportunity to search for a new place to cultivate. If he were to follow Yellow Maple Valley to another country, he would only be a high-level steward at best. Han Li was unwilling to live such a life.</p><p>If Han Li&#x2019;s thoughts were correct, after the Devil Dao annexed these countries, they would eventually gather their strength and resume fighting against the Righteous Dao Alliance.</p><p>When that time came, the whole Heavenly South Region would no longer be safe!</p><p>This was in opposition to Han Li&#x2019;s intention to peacefully cultivate!</p><p>If he were to go the State of Yuanwu now and see how the situation developed, couldn&#x2019;t he both find out whether or not the transportation formation could be restored and still see how the situation unfolded?</p><p>If the circumstances were truly terrible, he planned to use the transportation formation to travel to a different land and avoid the upcoming war.</p><p>As Han Li silently sunk into contemplation, his Divine Wind Boat turned into a streak of white light, and he disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Two days later, Han Li arrived at the border between the State of Yue and Yuanwu after taking a meandering route.</p><p>He turned his head to look at the mountains of the State of Yue and lightly sighed before flying into Yuanwu along with Crooked Soul.</p><p>Han Li couldn&#x2019;t have known that half a day later, a squad of several tens of Devil Dao cultivators would be stationed at this location. They were responsible for guarding fifty kilometers along the border to intercept any State of Yue cultivators that intended to enter the State of Yuanwu.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Once Han Li entered the State of Yuanwu, he first headed toward Golden Horse City.</p><p>After four days, he eventually arrived at the west hills of Golden Horse City.</p><p>Observing carefully from the sky, Han Li eventually found Qi Yunxiao&#x2019;s residence and slowly descended.</p><p>Han Li jumped off the boat, sweeping his gaze in every direction. What he saw left him stunned.</p><p>The stone rooms leaned at an unsteady angle, and all the rocks and azure bamboo were broken and scattered. They were most likely destroyed.</p><p>In addition, the defensive formations Qi Yunxiao[1. Qi Yunxiao was the Qi Condensation cultivator that gave him the Five Phases Reversal Formation in exchange for a rare medicinal herb. Last mentioned in <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">chapter 275</a>.] had laid out were broken through by force.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s face darkened, and he flipped his hand, taking out a magic tool. He then walked over to the mostly toppled rooms.</p><p>Although it seemed like this had occurred long ago, it was still prudent to be cautious!</p><p>Han Li searched the rooms, and among the destroyed interiors, he found a thoroughly rotted corpse.</p><p>Han Li pinched his nose and took a long, careful look at the corpse&#x2019;s face.</p><p>He wrinkled his brow. The corpse wasn&#x2019;t Qi Yunxiao but rather the loyal shopkeeper in charge of his store.</p><p>Much to his relief, Han Li found no other corpses in the other rooms.</p><p>After Han Li finished searching, his expression suddenly grew cold. His body turned into a blur, instantly reappearing on the Divine Wind Boat. He then turned his gaze toward the southern sky.</p><p>Above the southern hills, two streaks of deep blue light shot straight toward his location.</p><p>A moment later, they landed not far in front of Han Li. Once the light faded away, an old man and a youth were revealed.</p><p>The old man had a common appearance, aside from his thin, slender eyes and goatee. He was a Foundation Establishment cultivator and wore an expression of bewilderment.</p><p>The other person was a handsome youth that appeared to be about twenty years old. He was fiercely staring at Han Li with a baleful gaze, despite being only a Qi Condensation cultivator.</p>
