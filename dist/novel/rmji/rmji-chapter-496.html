<p><strong>Chapter 496: A Gorgeous Woman and a Spirit Well</strong></p><p>Much to Han Li&#x2019;s surprise, the path revealed by the map he found hidden within a wall had been peaceful. He didn&#x2019;t encounter any restrictions or puppets guards as he followed the map and eventually arrived at the tall wall without any trouble.</p><p>After looking at this common stone wall, Han Li unfolded the aged scroll and carefully examined it once more.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the place.&#x201D; Han Li muttered to himself with certainty. He emitted streaks of azure swordlight from the fingers of one of his hands and directly walked towards the stone wall.</p><p>Han Li rejoiced upon seeing there were no restrictions on the wall, and as he had hoped, the wall was hollow. He used his fingers to cut open a three-meter-wide circle with great ease, and gently pushed it with his other hand, revealing a large hole with a dark interior.</p><p>The swordlight on his fingers disappeared with a shake of his hand. He then summoned a ball of white light in his palm and had it slowly enter the room.</p><p>Without any further hesitation, he nimbly leapt in after it.</p><p>The hidden room was only about six meters tall and about fifteen meters wide. Although the entire room was covered by a thick layer of dust, there was also a very crude transportation formation at the center of the room.</p><p>The transportation formation was drawn with crooked lines, and its talisman markings were as crudely drawn as if it were a poor imitation of a formation by an unskilled layman.</p><p>Han Li wrinkled his brow. Could it be that the formation was incapable of being used or that it had been long since discarded? He took a step forward and inspected the formation using his own knowledge on spell formations. After a short while, he let out a long sigh.</p><p>Although the formation spell was crude, it could still be used. Furthermore, it didn&#x2019;t seem to be a long distance transportation formation. It would likely take him to a place that should seem at least somewhat familiar.</p><p>Han Li took out several spirit stones and quickly placed them on the four sides of the formation. After a series of hums, the spell formation shined with faint light. Han Li smiled at the sight. Instead of hastily using the formation, he turned his head to look at the hole in the wall and pondered for a moment.</p><p>He approached the wall and cast several minor restoration magic techniques, returning the fallen stone to the open wall. In the blink of an eye, the wall had returned to its original appearance. Han Li dusted off his hands and walked into the spell formation before disappearing in a flash of white light.</p><p>A moment later, Han Li reappeared in a thin mist. The mist was warm and carried a floral scent.</p><p>About three meters ahead of him, there was a milky white pond that spanned over thirty meters. The pond seemed to be the source of the white mist and fragrant odor.</p><p>What stunned him wasn&#x2019;t that, but the naked woman that was crouched at the pond. She seemed to have been enjoying the water.</p><p>The amazing sight of her lustrous, flawless body and her long, shiny black hair caused Han Li to unconsciously swallow, putting his mind into a daze. But when he saw her incredulous expression, Han Li bitterly smiled.</p><p>After bluntly taking a long look at the woman&#x2019;s body with a strange expression, he spoke without the slightest hint of sincerity, &#x201C;Lady Yuan, what a coincidence! You&#x2019;ve also arrived here. However, it seems I&#x2019;ve appeared at an unsuitable time.</p><p>The naked woman in the pond was actually the beauty Yuan Yao that had disappeared into the Inner Halls.</p><p>At that moment, Yuan Yao was in shock at Han Li&#x2019;s sudden appearance. When she heard him speak, she suddenly awoke and her face flushed red.</p><p>She hastily used her hands to cover her ample figure and flusteredly yelled, &#x201C;How did you get here! The transportation formation shouldn&#x2019;t be in any condition to be used. You.... quickly! Turn around!&#x201D; Yuan Yao appeared to be both startled and embarrassed.</p><p>After chuckling, Han Li didn&#x2019;t reply and casually walked back to the transportation formation and examined his surroundings.</p><p>It was a stone room that spanned over a hundred meters and had a stone gate at either end. Alongside the pond across from Han Li, black clothes and several storage pouches lay in a pile at its shore.</p><p>When Han Li&#x2019;s gaze fell onto the back wall, he spotted a white jade sculpture of a dragon head mounted ten meters up on the wall. About a meter below the sculpture there was a recess that shined with green light coming from a jade bottle with a long neck. It appeared to contain something valuable.</p><p>When Yuan Yao saw that Han Li spotted that jade bottle, she had forgotten about her embarrassment and revealed shock. However, Han Li turned a blind eye to the bottle and immediately turned his gaze. He instead walked towards the edge of the pond and lowered his head to look at the milky white water. Yuan Yao inwardly sighed and her expression returned to normal. However, her beautiful eyes glinted with a strange light as if she had thought of something.</p><p>At that moment, Han Li suddenly thought of something and swept his hand across the surface of the pond. Han Li easily cupped some of the water into his hand and brought it towards his eye.</p><p>The pond water was extreme fragrant and was filled with pure Heaven-Earth Qi. But after a short moment, he saw the fragrant Qi disappear from the water, turning back into regular water.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s expression stirred. Han Li tossed the water away in his hand and said, &#x201C;A spirit well spring! I truly didn&#x2019;t expect for the master of Heavenvoid Hall to have placed such a large spirit well here. Could it be that Lady Yuan Yao had braved such great danger for that reason?&#x201D; He then calmly turned his gaze towards her.</p><p>At that moment, Yuan Yao had recovered her calm, but when she saw Han Li sweep his gaze past her bare shoulders, she couldn&#x2019;t help but lower her body and angrily reply, &#x201C;Humph! Is that how Fellow Daoist Han speaks to a woman? Could it be that you still haven&#x2019;t seen enough of my naked body?&#x201D;</p><p>Even with her beautiful face warped by anger, she still appeared quite graceful.</p><p>She was truly the most outstanding beauty of a generation! As Han Li&#x2019;s gaze focused on the woman&#x2019;s appearance, his heart was set alight.</p><p>Although he had managed to keep his mind clear and free of desires, he was still a man. Despite being uninterested in forcing any disgraceful and unbecoming acts, he couldn&#x2019;t help but feast his eyes on the beautiful scene before him, and found himself wanting to make fun of her words.</p><p>As Han Li sat at the edge of the water, he took off his boots and boldly stepped into the water. He leisurely teased, &#x201C;If Lady Yuan wishes to wear clothes, please don&#x2019;t hesitate! I won&#x2019;t stop you in the slightest. However, if there is an opportunity to see such an amazing beauty, please don&#x2019;t expect me to act as a cultured gentleman. As such, I will be taking a look.&#x201D; With that said, Han Li smilingly stared at the blushing woman with chin in hand.</p><p>&#x201C;You...&#x201D; Yuan Yao&#x2019;s face was scarlet. She thought to say something, but with a roll of her eyes, her beautiful face immediately returned to normal. With a charming smile, she chuckled and said, &#x201C;Hehe, I had believed Fellow Daoist to be an uncultured brute without any understanding towards the fairer sex! I hadn&#x2019;t expected Fellow Daoist Han to understand such charms. As a great kindness, I will allow you to enjoy the sight of this young woman&#x2019;s body for a moment. However, the sight of a naked body can&#x2019;t be considered much to us cultivators. Therefore, I will be coming out to put on some clothes.&#x201D;</p><p>With that said, she shyly raised her hand from the water and lightly brushed her hair. She then seductively smiled at Han Li, revealing an amorous allure from her flawless beauty.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s mind grew blank as if he had been captivated by her.</p><p>In that instant, Yuan Yao gracefully struck the water, causing a curtain of white mist to emerge in front of her, blocking her entirely from Han Li&#x2019;s sight.</p><p>She took that opportunity to fly out of the water and shoot straight towards her clothes and items. A cloud of black Qi then emerged from her body, blocking her once more from sight. Once the black Qi disappeared, Yuan Yao was revealed to be fully dressed as she gently floated to the ground.</p><p>At some unknown time, the long jade bottle from underneath the statue had disappeared.</p>
