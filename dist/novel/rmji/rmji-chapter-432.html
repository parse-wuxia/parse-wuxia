<p>TL Note: The Master of Bones, Xiao Cha, will now be referred to as the Bone Sage, Xiao Cha.</p><p><strong>Chapter 432: Grandmaster Zenith Yin</strong></p><p>Among the people already in the hall was the Bone Sage that he had separated from recently. He was sitting cross-legged at a jade pillar in the corner of the hall, icily staring at him with unconcealed surprise.</p><p>At another jade pillar was a woman staring at Han Li with surprise. She was the Exquisite Sound Sect&#x2019;s Fairy Violet Spirit. An elegant man wearing an azure jacket with a composed appearance stood at her side.</p><p>When the man saw that Fairy Violet Spirit&#x2019;s expression was slightly odd he couldn&#x2019;t help but take measure of Han Li. Seeing that Han Li appeared youthful, his eyes coldly glinted, and he asked Fairy Violet Spirit a few questions.</p><p>As a result, Fairy Violet Spirit gracefully smiled and whispered to the man as if she were explaining Han Li&#x2019;s identity.</p><p>Han Li frowned and turned his eyes away from them. His gaze focused on another area where someone had gazed at Han Li with ill intent.</p><p>Han Li was baffled to find an old man with a face of fury, looking towards him. Han Li was startled for a moment before recognizing him and feeling annoyed. That person was the Six United Palace&#x2019;s Elder Miao.</p><p>Due to the matter of the Infant Carp Beast, Elder Gu had wished to kill him. However, Han Li took advantage of the great damage to his Origin Qi and his wondrous formation spell restrictions to turn the tables and eliminate him. Many years had past since this had occurred, but Elder Miao still recognized him. It seemed he felt rather deeply about Elder Gu&#x2019;s death.</p><p>Han Li inwardly muttered to himself, but found he didn&#x2019;t particularly care about it anymore. After observing the rest of the hall, there were no other cultivators he recognized.</p><p>Thus after some slight hesitation, he casually found a jade pillar with no one on it and flew to its top. He sat cross-legged before sizing up a few of the other cultivators that he didn&#x2019;t recognize.</p><p>Because Han Li&#x2019;s spiritual sense was restricted, he wasn&#x2019;t able to make out the cultivation of others. He only knew that a majority of cultivators here were at Core Formation or higher with Foundation Establishment cultivators in a small minority. There may even be a Nascent Soul eccentric or two among them.</p><p>With that in mind, Han Li carefully examined the others while he sat on the pillar.</p><p>Some time later, he had identified the two that were most likely to be Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>One was a yellow-robed, thin-faced old confucian scholar. He leisurely held his back with one hand while looking through a shabby jade slip with the other. He occasionally swayed his head with interest. He seemed incredibly bookish.</p><p>The other was a beautiful middle-aged woman wearing spotless white clothes. She was surrounded with a bone-chilling aura, preventing any strangers from approaching her.</p><p>At the moment, the icy beauty was expressionlessly cleaning her jet-black longsword. She appeared extremely proud. Ever since Han Li had entered the hall, he hadn&#x2019;t seen her look in any other direction.</p><p>Although the other cultivators also appeared calm and indifferent, their easy mannerisms seemed somewhat forced when compared to those two.</p><p>In addition, a large portion of the cultivators in the hall gazed at these two with a trace of respect that was absent when they looked at other cultivators. It was this slight difference that made Han Li certain that these two were Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>Originally, Han Li understood that apart from those two, there were certain to be other extraordinary individuals that couldn&#x2019;t be underestimated. A most obvious example would be the Bone Sage.</p><p>Although the old Devil&#x2019;s cultivation was only at late Core Formation, he was far superior to other late Core Formation cultivators in a fight, second only to true Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Who could possibly know what other hidden tigers laid in wait amongst the group?</p><p>Han Li inwardly muttered to himself for a moment, having seemingly forgotten that he himself could dispatch similar grade cultivators without much effort.</p><p>In any case, Han Li grew increasingly cautious after his musings and would occasionally ponder the true strength of those gathered here. This probably wasn&#x2019;t going to end up being a boring meeting of cultivators.</p><p>After all, the mystery displayed in the embroidered cloth map fragment and the floating Heavenvoid Hall had even attracted a few Nascent Soul cultivators. This guaranteed that something extraordinary was about to occur.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was completely ignorant of the details. Otherwise, he would be planning his future actions, thereby reducing his exposure to danger and limiting any disadvantages he might suffer from sudden surprises.</p><p>With the situation being what it was, Han Li could only act in accordance to how events played out.</p><p>As Han Li was lost in thought, he suddenly heard a sound transmission from the Bone Sage, &#x201C;Youngster, I didn&#x2019;t expect you&#x2019;d also have a Heavenvoid map fragment. How about we cooperate in this treasure hunt?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2018;Treasure hunt?&#x2019; Upon hearing those two words, Han Li&#x2019;s heart glowed with joy, knowing that it was correct for him to come. With an unchanged expression, he calmly replied, &#x201C;How does Senior intend to cooperate with me? Please give me an explanation!&#x201D;</p><p>The Bone Sage&#x2019;s expression brightened after hearing that Han Li hadn&#x2019;t refused. Just as he was thinking about what to say, two people swaggered into the hall.</p><p>When Han Li and the Bone Sage saw the two, their expressions greatly changed.</p><p>While Han Li&#x2019;s expression had only slightly paled, the Master of Bone&#x2019;s face completely distorted with his eyes revealing a blood-thirsty craze. Fortunately, his mind was quick and this expression only lasted for an instant before his calm expression reappeared.</p><p>The two that entered hadn&#x2019;t taken notice of the Bone Sage&#x2019;s abnormality. However, Han Li inwardly grumbled upon seeing the two, as one of them was Zenith Yin Island&#x2019;s young island lord Wu Chou.</p><p>Although Han Li was unfamiliar with the pale faced, slender eyed middle-aged cultivator by his side, he had a faint guess about who he was and couldn&#x2019;t help but feel regret for having come here.</p><p>At that moment, the middle-aged man brought Wu Chou into the hall and coldly swept his gaze in every direction. Soon, his gaze fell upon a cultivator with a sallow face, and he coldly laughed.</p><p>The sallow-faced cultivator paled, and his body slightly trembled. But after some quick thought, he immediately stood straight.</p><p>&#x201C;Good, very good!&#x201D; After finishing his chilling laughter, his eyes coldly glinted and fell upon Han Li.</p><p>When his gaze fell upon Han Li, he felt as if a viper was staring at him and felt his hair stand on end. Despite his calm appearance, his heart was in great disarray!</p><p>Han Li immediately felt amazement. The middle-aged man unexpectedly revealed a trace of unconcealed pleasant surprise upon seeing him. Although his expression soon became calm once more, Han Li was able to clearly see it. This caused Han Li to be at a loss with doubts pouring into his mind.</p><p>The Bone Sage also saw this and was stunned. But soon after, his eyes shifted several times, and he lowered his head in contemplation.</p><p>At that moment, the middle-aged man blankly looked at the old confucian scholar and the beautiful woman for a moment before restraining his cold gaze. He amiably cupped his hands to the two and said, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t expect to see South Crane Island&#x2019;s Brother Qing and White Wall Mountain&#x2019;s Lady Wen. I&#x2019;m truly sorry for not recognizing you!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is no disrespect. My clan is comparable to your own Zenith Yin Island. We only happened to meet by chance. After all, this is an opportunity that only occurs once every three hundred years. I&#x2019;ve also heard that Man Huzi acquired a Heavenvoid map fragment as an offering. He should be coming shortly. When the time comes, us old bastards will gather together once more.&#x201D; The old man put away the jade slip and spoke with an insincere smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Man Huzi is also coming?&#x201D; The middle-aged man&#x2019;s expression changed as if greatly fearful of that name.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I heard that his life is quickly coming to an end. He is coming to Heavenvoid Hall to find life prolonging fruit to refine a few life lengthening pills in hopes he may live a few more years.&#x201D; The old man spoke proudly with a voice containing hints of cold mockery.</p><p>The icy beautiful woman continued to look down at her sword treasure as she cleaned it, completely ignoring their conversation.</p><p>When Han Li heard their conversation, he couldn&#x2019;t help but take in a breath of cold air. He had acquired quite a bit of information from those few words.</p><p>The middle-aged man next to Wu Chou was actually Grandmaster Zenith Yin, and their words revealed that there was yet another Nascent Soul cultivator to come.</p><p>There were also life prolonging spirit medicines in Heavenvoid Hall! Inconceivable. It was no wonder that Nascent Soul experts so impatiently rushed here.</p>
