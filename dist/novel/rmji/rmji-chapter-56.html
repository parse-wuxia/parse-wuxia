<p><strong>Chapter 56 Battle of the Light Globes.</strong></p><div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view"><p><strong>Chapter 56: Battle of the Light Globes</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Yu Zhitong, I just want to remind you again that if anything happened to me, you won&#x2019;t be any better off.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You know that your soul won&#x2019;t last long in its current state and that you depend on me to help you look for a new body. So if there is anything you want to say, say it now while there is still time. I will not be angry unless it turns out you failed to tell me some crucial knowledge&#x201D; said Doctor Mo as he was unwilling to give up any attempts at trying to pry out hidden information from the mysterious youth.</p><p>From these words, it becomes evident to Han Li that Doctor Mo was in fact very afraid of Yu Zhiyong doing something at the final moment that would cause his downfall and was looking for more reassurance that his plans have not been tampered with.</p><p>In response to Doctor Mo&#x2019;s words, Yu Zhitong, who fully understood the risks involved with harming Doctor Mo, replied smoothly, &#x201C;There is no point in me tampering with your plans, and if I do then may my family suffer heaven&#x2019;s retribution.&#x201D;</p><p>Besides, after using the&#xA0;Seven Soul&#xA0;Devouring Technique, at the price of your fundamental essence, you would temporarily receive a certain amount of magic power, enabling to use a few simple&#xA0;spells; but your existence now is currently that of a soul, once your fundamental essence is used up, are you sure you could still execute such a spell?&#x201D; After Yu Zitong swore a venomous oath against harming Doctor Mo, he prodded at his weaknesses and leaving no way for Doctor Mo to back out.</p><p>Although Han Li wasn&#x2019;t religious, listening to their dialogue made Han Li pray silently to the Heavens that Doctor Mo would give up his evil plans. It seems like a ridiculous thing to do, but it was the only thing he could do.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay, I will use what I trust and ignore what I don&#x2019;t. Since there are such great benefits, it is only natural that there would be some risks,&#x201D; said Doctor Mo after making up his mind.</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Zhitong seemed quite happy&#xA0;and excitement appeared in&#xA0;his words.&#xA0;&#x201C;See, that is the correct mindset. Think about it. You were originally a mere mortal without spiritual roots, unable to step onto the path of immortality. But if this plan becomes a success, that will no longer be the case! With your new body and powerful spiritual foundation, any large sect or clan would beg for you to join. Not only that, your body would be immune to sickness and death, allowing you to live five times as long as a normal mortal!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, then I will trust you on this matter. Do not worry, I, Mo Juren, am a man of my words. What I say will most definitely be done. Once I am successful in this endeavor, I will immediately help you find a suitable body with a strong spiritual foundation. I promise you that I won&#x2019;t let you down, Little Brother Yu.&#x201D; After listening to Yu Zhitong&#x2019;s promises, Doctor Mo initial worry was gone as he took up a kinder tone, addressing Yu Zhitong with close familiarity.</p><p>&#x201C;Then if that is the case, I thank Big Brother Mo. After your success, I will single-handedly teach you each and every one of the cultivation techniques I have in my possession&#x201D; said the cunning Yu Zhitong; he knew he had successfully lured in Mo Juren with his words.</p><p>Han Li listened as the two shamelessly talked about using his body without asking for his opinions. Even though he realized that he wasn&#x2019;t able to do anything given his current situation, he couldn&#x2019;t help but feel annoyed at how they don&#x2019;t give him any face.</p><p>Once Doctor Mo dispelled his doubts and made up his decision to follow through with the plan, he no longer delayed, immediately pulling out some golden needles and stabbed them into his mixue acupuncture point located in the back of his head. He was immediately invigorated, his body filled with enough energy to perform the next step of his plan and increase his chances of success.</p><p>He strode to where Han Li lay, sat him upright into a meditating position, and then proceeded to sit in front of Han Li with his arms crossed over his chest, tightly hugging his shoulders.</p><p>Then, Doctor Mo executed a Celestial Technique. With a wave of his hand, a red beam of light shot out from his palms and hit the pattern that was laid out underneath Han Li, causing the jades placed around the perimeter of the diagram to glow.</p><p>Doctor Mo proceeded to whisper the spell incantation that held an enchanting and bewildering effect, causing those who heard it to feel drowsy. As the chant continued, Han Li felt a deep sense of weariness, causing everything to become a blur as he slowly lost consciousness.</p><p>&#x201C;Not good&#x201D; thought Han Li, knowing fully well that this was the intended effect of the mysterious chant and that once he fell unconscious, his body would be possessed. Holding onto this thought, Han Li resisted the temptation to sleep. Thoughts of biting his tongue and pinching himself were quickly disregarded as he was not in control of his body, so in the end, no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to fight off the effects of the spell and fell to a deep slumber. Right before he fell unconscious, the last image he saw was the handsome face of Doctor Mo. At that moment, however, Doctor Mo looked more like an ugly devil than a handsome figure. The last words Han Li wanted to say to Doctor Mo was, &#x201C;Your ugliness suits you.&#x201D;</p><p>Within the endless darkness of his subconscious, Han Li dreamt a very strange dream. In his dream, he was a fist-sized globe of green light that was happy and free in his own little world.</p><p>But not long after, a thumb-sized yellow globe carrying an evil intent suddenly invaded his dream. Upon seeing the green globe, the yellow ball of light aggressively charged at the green globe of light, suddenly revealing its mouth to bite down upon the green globe that was Han Li. Of course Han Li was not weak, and he also opened his mouth to retaliate. After just a few exchanges, Han Li easily ended the battle by swallowing the yellow globe of light. The victorious Han Li rejoiced in his victory, but soon enough another intruder entered his subconscious. This foreign entity was also a green globe of light that was many more times the size of Han Li, but it did not contain the same glow and luster of Han Li&#x2019;s globe of light. When the enemy saw Han Li&#x2019;s globe of light, it was shocked; hesitation appeared on its features.</p><p>After Han Li experienced the amazing taste of devouring other globes of light, the sight of a new enemy did not cause Han Li to give much thought to his opponent&#x2019;s power as he charged right at his enemy with the intent of devouring him. The enemy, seeing Han Li&#x2019;s attack, reluctantly chose to charge forward and engage in battle. Even though the opponent was many times bigger than Han Li, its attacks were only slightly stronger than the yellow globe of light Han Li recently devoured. Upon realizing its disadvantage, the invader tried to turn and escape, but Han Li was unwilling to let it leave so easily and gave chase, biting at the fleeing invader. The invader was very tricky and slippery; every time Han Li seemed to have caught it, the green globe would cut off the part that was caught and continue to flee. In the end, the invader managed to flee, but its body mass was one third its original size. Although Han Li was reluctant to let his opponent go, there was nothing he could do about the matter and so decided to wait around for more enemies to invade so that he could also devour them. Sadly, no more globes of light came, and he continued to float around.</p><p></p><div style="margin: 8px 0px"><p></p><p></p></div><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
