<p><strong>Chapter 334: A Strange Change</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Poisoned? That&#x2019;s impossible. I am quite careful and have a specialist responsible for testing my food and drink!&#x201D; After a moment of terror, Sun Ergou revealed an appearance of unease.</span></p><p><span style="">Hearing this, Han Li was too lazy to explain any further. With a wave of his hand, a streak of azure light flashed and flew into Sun Ergou&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Master! This is... wh-... what&#x2019;d you...&#x201D; Sun Ergou hadn&#x2019;t dared to dodge, but was still alarmed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is True Spirit Technique, it&#x2019;s capable of visualizing the poison within your body. Go ahead and take a look in a mirror!&#x201D; Han Li sat on a chair and played it down.</span></p><p><span style="">When Sun Ergou heard this, his heart dropped. Then he hastily ran to the corner of the room with a dressing table.</span></p><p><span style="">He hastily scoured the dressing table for a small mirror and then looked into the mirror with great caution. What he saw left him dumbfounded. He saw that his entire face was covered in blackish-purple Qi. From a single glance, he could tell he was severely poisoned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Master, please save my life! This one has remained faithful to Young Master this entire time and possesses no trace of disloyalty.&#x201D; Sun Ergou rushed over to Han Li with an expression of fear and knelt while imploring Han Li to save him.</span></p><p><span style="">At this moment, he was almost entirely convinced!</span></p><p><span style="">As Han Li was a cultivator, it was impossible he would waste so much effort to deceive someone like Sun Ergou. If Han Li had truly meant him harm, he could&#x2019;ve killed him with a flick of a finger.</span></p><p><span style="">After having seen this display of loyalty, Han Li faintly smiled and calmly said, &#x201C;Be at ease. Although the poison is quite hidden, it&#x2019;s toxicity is weak. It won&#x2019;t be able to kill you in a few days. There is no need to be so fussed over nothing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although Sun Ergou had calmed down a bit, he continued his pitiful pleas, &#x201C;Young Master possesses great power. Please give this one a method to dissolve the poison so that I, Sun Ergou, may continue to serve you faithfully! If Young Master does not trust me then I can swear an oath under poison. This one...&#x201D; Although Sun Ergou was now a gang leader, we was still very much afraid of death. Without even waiting for Han Li to speak, he took the initiative to swear his own oaths &#x2014; much to Han Li&#x2019;s amusement. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x2018;Serve me faithfully? It seems more like he has been receiving benefits without giving anything in return!&#x2019; Han Li thought, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a detoxification pill. After you take this, you&#x2019;ll be fine but just make sure that your poisoning does not continue.&#x201D; Han Li shook his head before tossing a blue medicine pill to Sun Ergou. &#xA0;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Many thanks! Many thanks, Young Master!&#x201D; Sun Ergou received the pill with great joy and repeatedly expressed his thanks. He then quickly climbed up from the floor and properly put away the pill. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This poison doesn&#x2019;t affect one so deeply after only one or two exposures. It should have taken at least several months for it to get to this point! I believe that you should be able to find the poisoner. Surely you can do that at least; isn&#x2019;t that right, my dear Gang Leader Sun?&#x201D; Han Li lightly chuckled and said half-jokingly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Master teases! However, as for who poisoned me, I do have a few suspects in mind.&#x201D; Sun Ergou rubbed the back of his head with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">As his life had been just saved by Han Li, he was naturally now even more respectful towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;En! As a cultivator, I can&#x2019;t be too involved in the affairs of you mortals. I&#x2019;ll leave it to you! The reason why I came here was because I wanted to see Crooked Soul[1. In <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Chapter 63</a>, it is revealed that Crooked Soul is the refined corpse of his deceased best friend. Finding this puppet too heavy to carry, he leaves it behind to Sun Ergou in <a href="www.wuxiaworld.com">Chapter 125</a>.] and take him away. Now that I have quite a bit of cultivation, I shouldn&#x2019;t have any problem bringing him along. Do you have any complaints about this?&#x201D; Han Li&#x2019;s smiled disappeared as he said this with a deep voice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Master wishes to take Sir Crooked Soul away? But Young Master, Sir Crooked Soul is no longer in the Fourth Level Gang.&#x201D; When Sun Ergou heard Han Li&#x2019;s tone, he incessantly complained in his heart, but he still had to summon the courage to reply.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What do you mean? You lost him?&#x201D; Han Li&#x2019;s face darkened and the temperature in the room dropped several degrees, causing Sun Ergou tremble in fright.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Young Master, please calm down! It wasn&#x2019;t that I had lost him, but that Sir Crooked Soul had run off on his own. Although he is not in the city, he is not too far away, at a nearby mountain forest. I had sent a few people to follow after Sir Crooked Soul!&#x201D; Sun Ergou explained at great speed, fearing that Han Li would act on his anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He ran off on his own? What going on? Explain it clearly. If it isn&#x2019;t as you say, then don&#x2019;t blame me for coming back to punish you!&#x201D; Although slight astonishment had flashed across Han Li&#x2019;s face, &#xA0;he still managed to respond with a relaxed expression.</span></p><p><span style="">It was good enough that Sun Ergou knew about Crooked Soul&#x2019;s whereabouts. But since Crooked Soul was only a walking corpse, Han Li found it hard to believe that he could have run away on his own.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that Han Li wasn&#x2019;t angry, Sun Ergou felt relieved. Not daring to neglect him, he hastily explained, &#x201C;Ever since Young Master had handed over Sir Crooked Soul to me, I have followed Young Master&#x2019;s instructions to only use him as a last resort and to not allow others to see him. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But an anomaly occurred six years ago with Sir Crooked Soul. That period of time was a crucial moment of expansion for my gang and we were against a mid level gang with a great amount of experts. I had Sir Crooked Soul help me deal with them. During that battle, Crooked Soul had displayed great might and won our gang a decisive victory. But a few days after the battle had concluded, a subordinate I tasked with watching Crooked Soul suddenly came and reported that he had actually started talking. I was extremely astonished and rushed over with the &#x2018;Soul Guiding Bell&#x2019;. Then...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sun Ergou stopped there and bitterly smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened? Don&#x2019;t tell me that Crooked Soul attacked you while still in possession of the Soul Guiding Bell?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Having heard that Crooked Soul could speak, he was greatly astonished. But having seen that Sun Ergou had deliberately kept him in suspense, Han Li unhappily rebuked him.</span></p><p><span style="">Frightened, Sun Ergou continued, &#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t attack me. But before I entered his room, Sir Crooked Soul seemed to know that I had arrived; he suddenly broke the wall and ran away as if he was flying. I was completely unable to chase after him!&#x201D; As Sun Ergou said this, he revealed an expression of helplessness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He ran away?!&#x201D; With raised eyebrows, Han Li&#x2019;s mind seemed to have wandered off into thought. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, Young Master! Although Sir Crooked Soul has done this for several years, for some reason, he is still lingering at the boundary of the forest. Although I&#x2019;ve tried several times to find Crooked Soul and bring him back with the aid of my gang&#x2019;s experts, he was always unwilling to see me. Whenever I approached him, he would immediately flee. I had a few experts block his path, but nobody proved to be Sir Crooked Soul&#x2019;s opponent. Two of my gang&#x2019;s experts have even died.&#x201D; Sun Ergou said, perplexed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t a great mystery! It&#x2019;s likely because of the Soul Guiding Compass that you carry! Although I don&#x2019;t know why control over Crooked Soul was lost, it seems the restrictions I originally put on him were still effective.&#x201D; Han Li coldly laughed before saying this with an indifferent expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it was like that!&#x201D; Sun Ergou had appeared to be convinced.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed that he had previously come to that conclusion as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Tell me about Crooked Soul&#x2019;s whereabouts. I will deal with him later. As it seems that this matter isn&#x2019;t your doing, I&#x2019;ll have to personally go to see what had happened. Since you no longer have a use for the Soul Guiding Bell, give it to me.&#x201D; After a moment of thought, Han Li said this calmly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes, Young Master. My subordinates reported of Sir Crooked Soul&#x2019;s whereabouts two days ago. He is currently in the west side of...&#x201D; Sun Ergou respectfully gave directions to a place about a hundred kilometers outside of Jiayuan City. He then carefully took out the &#x201C;Soul Guiding Bell&#x201D; magic tool and offered it to Han Li with both hands.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li nodded his head and examined the magic tool for a moment. He then placed it in his storage pouch, having found that it was in good condition.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In addition to Crooked Soul, I came here because I also had a few questions to ask you about the Rainbow Sect. You must answer me honestly!&#x201D; Han Li&#x2019;s face suddenly grew stiff; his voice once more becoming cold.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li&#x2019;s change in tone had clearly stunned Gang Leader Sun. After a short pause, he repeatedly nodded his head like a baby chick pecking&#xA0;grain. </span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What kind of person is the current Rainbow Sect Master? What family does he have? Have any outsiders recently appeared in the Li Estate and have any of them remained?&#x201D; Han Li fired these questions off with a stiff expression.</span></p><p><span style="">Sun Ergou felt his heart tremble, but he answered without the slightest hesitation, &#x201C;As for the Rainbow Sect Master, this one truly doesn&#x2019;t understand what sort of person he is. This one had only previously seen him at a distance and I only understand that his martial arts are unfathomable. With regards to family, he has two sons and a daughter; all of whom are married. I&#x2019;ve heard that his eldest son is presiding over at the Rainbow Sect&#x2019;s previous headquarters. His second son has followed the Rainbow Sect Master to the Li Estate and is presiding over that. I&#x2019;ve also heard...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Sun Ergou gave a very comprehensive explanation. It was clear that he regularly put forth great effort into gathering intelligence on the Rainbow Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">As Han Li calmly listened, he unconsciously placed his hand on the table and started to tap; it appeared he was digesting the information. </span></p><p><span style="">When Sun Ergou saw Han Li stay silent for a moment, his heart stirred and he carefully asked, &#x201C;Could it be because of that matter with the Mo Estate several years ago that you wish to act against the Rainbow Sect?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Once Han Li heard this, his brow wrinkled as his face became gloomy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You speak too much! Don&#x2019;t randomly ask about matters you have no right to know! Even more so, do not guess. You wouldn&#x2019;t want to tragically become one of those poor souls who have lost their memories, right?&#x201D; </span></p><p><span style="">Han Li&#x2019;s ice-cold voice caused Sun Ergou&#x2019;s expression to drop and he immediately begged for forgiveness.</span></p><p><span style="">Han Li snorted, letting the matter drop. One couldn&#x2019;t afford to be polite when establishing authority. </span></p>
