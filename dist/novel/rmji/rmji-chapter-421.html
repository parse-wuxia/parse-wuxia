<p><strong>Chapter 421: Spirit Sealing Pillar</strong></p><p>In the distant sky at an unknown time, a huge cloud of insects spanning over a hundred meters had appeared, staining that part of the sky gold and silver. The huge buzzing seemed to be coming from this new cloud of insects.</p><p>Underneath the insect cloud, Han Li looked at the eccentric with a gaze as if he were looking at a corpse. He commanded, &#x201C;Go!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the huge insect cloud flew towards the eccentric as an overbearing sky-shrouding shadow.</p><p>The eccentric&#x2019;s limbs grew ice-cold. This insect cloud was over ten times larger than the previous. It wasn&#x2019;t something he could withstand. In his terror, he felt a sudden desire to flee.</p><p>With an unsightly expression, he recalled his transformed flower basket. He then struck his two ghost heads with blood-red magic seals, and began to chant a cryptic incantation. As for the weapons that were disabled and had been held within the white mist, they were tossed away without hesitation.</p><p>The eccentric&#x2019;s decisiveness surprised Han Li.</p><p>The two ghost heads madly spat out several more wisps of flames as they retreated, but Han Li wasn&#x2019;t about to let them slip away so easily.</p><p>Under his command, the huge insect cloud thoroughly drowned the ghost heads and their flames in an instant. The flames were cleanly consumed by the several tens of thousands of Gold Devouring Beetles in an instant, and the ghost heads&#x2019; themselves were filled with countless Gold Devouring Beetles.</p><p>With this, Han Li knew that the skulls were already finished. But just as he wanted to collect the Gold Devouring Beetles and go chase after the eccentric, he heard two enormous explosions.</p><p>The two ghost heads had self detonated in twin blazes of green flame, engulfing a large portion of the Gold Devouring Beetles. Han Li was initially left reeling by the scene but that soon disappeared.</p><p>From his mental connection, apart from the several hundred closest to the heart of the explosion, a vast majority of his Gold Devouring Beetles were unscathed.</p><p>It seemed that these immature Gold Devouring Beetles were not invulnerable. After a certain limit, they were still capable of being destroyed.</p><p>However, their sturdiness was already much to Han Li&#x2019;s satisfaction. After all, the Gold Devouring Beetles only suffered damage from the extremely powerful detonation of the ghost heads. He was confident that any common Core Formation cultivator wouldn&#x2019;t stand a chance against these insects.</p><p>With that thought, Han Li wordlessly turned into an azure streak and collected his Gold Devouring Beetles before chasing after the eccentric.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s thoughts were quite simple. Since deep hatred was planted between him and the eccentric, it was naturally better to settle this problem once and for all. Not wanting to leave a potential enemy, he couldn&#x2019;t allow him to easily escape.</p><p>A second later, Crooked Soul joined him and flew next to Han Li as a streak of yellow light, joining in the pursuit.</p><p>As for the others, they glanced at each other while staying in their original places. It seemed that for the time being, they were incapable of believing that Han Li had single-handedly forced the eccentric to flee.</p><p>The eccentric&#x2019;s escape method was quite impressive. Even when using the entirety of his strength to propel his green brilliance dagger, the distance between them was only gradually increasing. In the blink of an eye, the three had traveled over twenty kilometers and were about to leave the scope of the barren island.</p><p>Seeing this, Han Li&#x2019;s eyes glinted with cold light. After taking a deep breath, seven palm-sized emerald green swords suddenly shot from his body.</p><p>After flying a circle around his body, the small swords merged into a huge green sword. With a blur, Han Li and Crooked Soul arrived on the huge sword. It then flashed with green radiance and cut through the sky as an emerald streak of light that was nearly forty meters long, increasing their speed by nearly fifty percent.</p><p>After the time it took to make a cup of tea, Han Li had caught up to the eccentric. After seeing the black light that was singularly focused on flying, Han Li waved his arm with an icy expression. Two small emerald swords shot towards it along with Crooked Soul&#x2019;s Immemorial Bowl.</p><p>The escaping eccentric had clearly seen that his relentless pursuers had released their magic treasures towards him. He immediately responded by throwing a skull towards them. Afterwards, the eccentric continued flying without looking back.</p><p>According to the eccentric&#x2019;s thoughts, the skull should be able to buy him some precious time at the very least.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s expression darkened, and he silently cast an incantation gesture. His two flying swords then flashed with green light and turned into four swordlights which were indistinguishable from one another. Two of these swordlights and the immemorial bowl flew straight towards the skull while the other two swordlights combined to form a foot-long flying sword. It rushed past the skull and shot towards the back of the eccentric without a sound.</p><p>The flying sword became much faster after combining together and arrived behind the eccentric in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, the eccentric felt that something was amiss and turned his head, discovering an emerald streak of light that was only fifteen meters away from him.</p><p>The eccentric&#x2019;s face turned deathly pale. Responding quickly to the emergency, he opened his mouth and spewed a puff of black Qi towards the flying sword. Afterwards, he hastily flew away, wanting to escape.</p><p>Under Han Li&#x2019;s command, the flying sword continued straight through the black Qi without any hesitation. As it approached, an arc of faint golden lightning struck the black Qi and thoroughly blew it away, leaving the flying sword completely unobstructed.</p><p>Then with a flash of green light, the emerald flying sword pierced through the eccentric.</p><p>The eccentric looked down at the flying sword in his chest with an expression of complete disbelief. Without the chance to say a single word, he was struck with faint golden lightning and turned to ash.</p><p>Han Li hastily approached. After blurring a few times, he reappeared with three items in his hands and focused his attention on them. Apart from the flower basket ancient antiquity, there was also a storage pouch and a scroll painting sparkling with red light. From paintings stealthily contained Spiritual Qi, even if it wasn&#x2019;t a desolate antiquity, it was still undoubtedly an unordinary magic treasure.</p><p>Delighted, Han Li gently unrolled the scroll and was soon stunned.</p><p>After staring at the scroll for a long while, Han Li slowly rolled it back up and wore a contemplative expression. Forcefully suppressing the suspicions he had in mind, Han Li flew towards the skull in silence.</p><p>Now lacking a master, the black skull floated in the air without movement. Although it still retained a trace of its evil Qi, it now completely lacked any trace of its former intelligence.</p><p>After taking a look, Han Li slightly frowned. In truth, this was the first time he had seen an item like this. He faintly felt that this item definitely had a bad history, but he still felt reluctant to just let it go. After a moment of hesitation, he decided to store it in a jade box.</p><p>After circling around the area once more, Han Li flew back with Crooked Soul. On the way, he encountered Jin Qing and the others who on their way to assist him.</p><p>Having seen Han Li and Crooked Soul return completely unharmed, they crowded around him in pleasant surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;Fellow Daoist Han, what happened to that eccentric? Did he escape?&#x201D; Jin Qing couldn&#x2019;t help but ask.</p><p>&#x201C;He died by my hand!&#x201D; Han Li calmly said.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s dead? That&#x2019;s great. From his profuse, evil Qi, we would have definitely found ourselves hopelessly entangled if he decided to pursue us in the future. That would&#x2019;ve proved to be extremely troublesome.&#x201D; Jin Qing replied with a large breath of relief.</p><p>With slightly changed expressions, the nearby Hu Yue and cultivator Jian looked at Han Li with gazes of involuntary respect.</p><p>After all, one&#x2019;s capability defined one&#x2019;s status in the cultivation world.</p><p>Afterwards, the party returned to their original location where Fairy Shi was worriedly waiting for them.</p><p>The group gathered together once more. After some discussion, Han Li felt that it would be best to quickly break through the formation in order to prevent any further unexpected incidents from occurring.</p><p>Thus, the group once again got into formation. After refocusing his heart, Han Li placed down the formation flags and plates.</p><p>The destruction of the last restriction was exceptionally smooth. After the scarlet light barrier was destroyed, the &#x201C;Winged Fiends&#x201D; contained within were cleanly eliminated by their water attribute magic tools.</p><p>The party revealed joy and soon turned their gazes towards the strange, exposed stone pillar at the center.</p><p>With no restrictions in the way, the group was clearly able to see the stone pillar with their spiritual sense and eyesight.</p><p>The stone pillar&#x2019;s talisman markings were extremely strange. The pillar was covered in eight huge ancient talisman scripts that spiralled around it from top to bottom along with countless strange stripes. In addition, the stone pillar was embedded with extremely rare Yin-Yang Jade in an even distribution. They occasionally flashed with dim black and white lights.</p><p>After looking at this for some time, they looked at each other in confusion and sunk into contemplation, bitterly attempting to recall any relatable information.</p><p>&#x201C;Spirit Sealing Pillar!&#x201D; After a short moment, the weakest among them, Shi Die, suddenly shouted out the name of the stone pillar in alarm.</p><p>The others were stunned upon hearing this, but they soon looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>&#x201C;Fairy Shi, are you certain? Is this really a Spirit Sealing Pillar?&#x201D; Hu Yue couldn&#x2019;t help but ask with doubt.</p><p>&#x201C;Absolutely! I possess a book of ancient formation spells that particularly mentions the Spirit Sealing Pillar. From its appearance and those talisman markings, it is exactly as was described in the book. Don&#x2019;t be fooled into believing it to be some common stone pillar. It was forged from over ten extremely precious tool refinement materials. This lone pillar is worth about six thousand spirit stones.&#x201D; Shi Die gazed at this pillar with excitement.</p>
