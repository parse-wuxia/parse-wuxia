<p><strong>Chapter 469: Acquiring Treasure</strong></p><p>While Han Li was normally steadfast, this sight caused his mind to sway, leaving him in a daze. After forcing himself to look deeper and ignore his feelings of discomfort, he turned away without gaining anything. Despite having immense spiritual sense, he was unable to figure out anything about the abyss.</p><p>Afterwards, Han Li continued on his way without hesitation.</p><p>Once he grew closer to the pavilion, its true size was revealed, appearing at least four times as large as common buildings. Its entrance was an arched door that was six meters tall and was covered in a screen of yellow light.</p><p>After Han Li arrived at the front, he examined the light screen and tilted his head in thought. With a flash of azure light, his hand was covered in swordlight. He lightly touched the light screen with his finger. The light screen rippled, but it allowed the swordlight in without the slightest resistance.</p><p>Han Li felt slightly surprised by this. He then withdrew the azure swordlight and inserted his arm into the yellow light. It felt slightly cold as if his arm were surrounded by water.</p><p>Without any further hesitation, Han Li stepped forward, disappearing into the light barrier.</p><p>But after he entered the arched doors, Han Li stood in place with a look of astonishment.</p><p>He saw rows of round white jade tables about a meter tall, each of differing sizes. Their surfaces were covered in flickering light barriers of all colors as if they were concealing something underneath.</p><p>Han Li&#x2019;s gaze focused, revealing at race of excitement.</p><p>When Han Li first saw the words &#x201C;Treasure Light Pavilion, he had already guessed that he had come across great fortune. This pavilion most likely contained ancient treasures. However, it appeared that the pavilion was desolate. It seemed all the people that had arrived here either went to the second floor or had already chosen an ancient treasure and moved on.</p><p>With that thought, Han Li examined the jade tables. As he had expected, there were jade tables that lacked both an item and the light barrier.</p><p>&#x2018;And the stairs to the second floor?&#x2019; Han Li was slightly puzzled. He swept his gaze all around and couldn&#x2019;t find it! After looking around several times with great interest, Han Li spotted a particularly unusual jade table.</p><p>This jade table was at the back of the first floor and appeared alone. It was extremely smooth and was engraved with profound, cryptic talisman markings.</p><p>Han Li examined it several times and drew from his own knowledge of spell formations to conclude it was a simple transportation formation with peculiar shape. He then slowly walked past the rows of jade tables and gazed at the ancient treasures they contained.</p><p>After looking at them, Han Li frowned. &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t these ancient treasures a bit too lacking?&#x201D;</p><p>After looking at several tens of jade tables, Han Li completely lost his interest. He stood in place, muttering to himself with crossed arms and a doubtful expression.</p><p>The items on the jade tables were unworthy of the name of &#x201C;ancient treasures&#x201D;. They were all either spears or halberds of an ancient style. Although they all flashed with various colored ancient Qi, Han Li clearly understood that these items were the near equivalent of flying swords and saber magic treasures that were used in the present. Their abilities wouldn&#x2019;t be particularly exceptional.</p><p>Of course, they couldn&#x2019;t be said to be useless! But with the Bamboo Cloudswarm Swords in his possession, the items on this floor held little interest to him. He wanted ancient treasures that had extraordinary abilities like his flower basket.</p><p>Although he thought this, he forced himself to look through all the items on the floor in fear that he would miss something. As a result, Han Li sighed and walked to the transportation formation without further hesitation. He believed that the items of the second floor should prove different.</p><p>After placing several spirit stones on the transportation formation, Han Li arrived at a new location with a flash of white light.</p><p>&#x2018;This was the second floor of the Treasure Light Pavilion?&#x2019; Han Li looked ahead of him with squinted eyes and tight lips.</p><p>The room wasn&#x2019;t large. Apart from a huge spherical light barrier in front of him, there was nothing else in the room. The light barrier was about forty meters tall and floated about three meters above the center of the room, shining with a soft azure radiance. Several tens of different ancient treasure calmly floated within.</p><p>There were scrolls, jade tiles, alm bowls, and black banners as well as many other items that Han Li hadn&#x2019;t seen before. There were no duplicate items to speak of.</p><p>When Han Li saw this, he was delighted and knew he had come to the right place.</p><p>However, these items were so openly on display. If they were so easily taken, they wouldn&#x2019;t still be there by the time he arrived.</p><p>With that thought, Han Li slowly walked towards the sphere of light with his hands behind his back. After quickly circling around it several times, he stopped and opened his mouth, spitting out an inch-long azure sword.</p><p>It spiraled above his head many times before it struck at the bottom of light barrier as a streak of azure light.</p><p>Peng. A flicker of blue light sparked from where the swordlight attempted to pierced the light barrier. The swordlight was then immediately repelled, leaving no mark behind.</p><p>Han Li wasn&#x2019;t particularly surprised by this. This merely displayed how valuable the ancient treasures were.</p><p>With an excited expression, Han Li opened his mouth and spouted out eight more small swords. The nine swords released a long shriek above him and combined into a huge azure sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Strike!&#x201D; Han Li softly shouted.</p><p>The huge sword struck the light barrier with mountain breaking momentum. Boom. In the instant the huge sword touched the barrier, a meter large hole appeared.</p><p>Han Li revealed a trace of happiness, but before he could move, a huge force suddenly blew away the huge sword from the light barrier. With a flash of blue light, the light barrier returned to normal.</p><p>Han Li was astonished. He then reexamined the sphere of light with a gloomy expression and with his chin in hand.</p><p>Not long after, Han Li&#x2019;s expression relaxed and he faintly smiled. He pointed towards the huge sword, causing it to disassemble back into nine small swords with a clear ring. Having returned them into his body, he reached towards his waist and took out the Gold Devouring Beetles&#x2019; spirit beast pouches without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>With a loud buzz, the gold and silver insect swarm flocked out from the pouches. Han Li whistled in a low tone, causing the insect swarm to charge towards the sphere of light. In an instant, the insects had covered the bottom of the light barrier. In mere moments, the insect swarm forcibly gnawed out a meter large hole from the light barrier.</p><p>Blue light flourished from the light barrier, causing the round hole to distort and shrink. The barrier was recovering at greater speed than the Gold Devouring Beetles could destroy.</p><p>When Han Li saw this, he didn&#x2019;t dare to delay. He immediately turned into streak of slender azure light and quickly flew into the hole just before it closed.</p><p>The azure light faded away inside the light barrier to reveal Han Li.</p><p>He gently floated amongst the many ancient treasures inside the light sphere. Their ancient aura caused him to feel somewhat excited. However, Han Li didn&#x2019;t dare to wait too long and hastily released his spiritual sense in an attempt to probe the intensity of the ancient treasures&#x2019; spiritual Qi. He soon wore a bitter expression. His spiritual sense was actually unable to leave his body inside the barrier. As such, he would only be able to rely on experience and intuition to choose a treasure.</p><p>Without any other choice, Han Li could only glare at the items with widened eyes.</p><p>&#x2018;The strange blade? No, it was clearly an offensive ancient treasure. Those weren&#x2019;t rare.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The command medallion? No, it was engraved with the image of a strange beast. It should be the same as the scroll painting of the Congealed Yang Birds and contain the souls of spirit beasts.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The snare drum? What&#x2019;s this? I can&#x2019;t make out its use. Let&#x2019;s forget about it.&#x2019;</p><p>One by one, Han Li eliminated the ancient treasures he wouldn&apos;t choose. Eventually, Han Li narrowed his selection to three items: a gold oval mirror, a chain of five different-colored copper bands, and a wide dark-red cloak.</p><p>Han Li naturally had his own reasons for why he had picked them. Needless to say for the golden mirror, mirrors-type magic treasures each possessed unique and remarkable abilities. Han Li didn&#x2019;t wish to pass on such a powerful treasure.</p><p>As for the chain of five different-colored copper bands, they simultaneously contained the five elements. Although he didn&#x2019;t know its ability, he knew it couldn&#x2019;t possibly be weak.</p><p>And for the cloak...</p>
