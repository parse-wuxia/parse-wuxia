<p><strong> Chapter 2416 - Betting Lives On The Battle</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you finally dared to come out now?&#x201D; Kong Ruozeng looked to Chu Feng with a gaze filled with grievances.</p><p>&#x201C;Kong Ruozeng, you have wanted to spar against me the entire time. Today, I will satisfy you. However, I have a condition,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Condition? You&#x2019;re not old, yet you have a lot of demands.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Well, whatever. Go ahead and say your condition. As long as you are willing to spar with me, I will agree to any condition,&#x201D; Kong Ruozeng said in a disapproving manner.</p><p>&#x201C;My brother Wang Qiang and I have arrived here as guests. As guests, we should abide by the rules of the host. As such, we did not want to provoke any quarrel.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you&#x2026; you are truly too overbearing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Earlier, not only did you torment my brother Wang qiang, you actually even wanted to actually kill him. Since you are so fond of killing others, I, Chu Feng, shall accompany you in this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, I, Chu Feng, am willing to fight against you, Kong Ruozeng. However, I have a condition.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unless either you or I are to die, this battle is not allowed to end,&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze was burning like flames, and his voice echoed like thunder.</p><p>When the crowd heard what he said, they felt as if they had been struck by lightning.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah? Not over unless one is to die? That would be a fight to the death.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, he actually wants to battle with their lives on the line against that member of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation?&#x201D;</p><p>The crowd were all tongue-tied with their eyes wide open. They were stunned. It was not only the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan; even the bystanders were feeling endlessly shocked.</p><p>A spar and a fight to the death were two completely different things.</p><p>Even though Kong Ruozeng had indeed been excessive earlier, and Chu Feng&#x2019;s hatred and desire for revenge from seeing his brother being humiliated was also understandable, it remained that this was the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s territory.</p><p>To want to kill a Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s genius in the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s territory, this was simply too brazen.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s action was simply akin to not placing the Kong Heavenly Clan in his eyes at all.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard that this Chu Feng is a man of real emotions, that he is someone that will fear nothing when he feels grievances in his heart. Seeing him today, he is actually truly as rumored.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although he might appear to be overly daring at first glance, his fearless attitude is something that ordinary people do not possess. Furthermore, the people who generally possess this trait are all people that will achieve greatness in the future. This Chu Feng is truly extraordinary.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It has been a very long time since someone like Chu Feng has appeared in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that my decision to come to the Kong Heavenly Clan was truly a correct one.&#x201D;</p><p>After a moment of astonishment, the guests all cast admiring gazes toward Chu Feng.</p><p>At the same time, their eyes were filled with anticipation. They had come precisely to see Chu Feng&#x2019;s graceful bearing. And today&#x2026; they would soon be able to witness Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength, granting their desires.</p><p>&#x201C;Why have you grown quiet? Are you scared?&#x201D; Chu Feng saw that Kong Ruozeng was silent, and thus questioned him intensely.</p><p>&#x201C;Bullshit!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How could I, a grand genius of the Kong Heavenly Clan, possibly fear you?&#x201D;</p><p>Although Kong Ruozeng was trying to act tough with words, the cold sweat on his forehead betrayed him.</p><p>At that moment, he was indeed slightly scared.</p><p>If it were only a spar, he would not be afraid of Chu Feng. After all, the two of them possessed the same sort of inherited bloodline. As such, they should be equally matched.</p><p>Furthermore, as he had taken the forbidden medicine, his battle power should surpass Chu Feng&#x2019;s enormously. As such&#x2026; he was very confident in himself.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s declaration of betting their lives from the get-go caused him to lose confidence in himself.</p><p>It was their lives they were talking about here. People only had a single life. If one&#x2019;s life was lost, everything would be gone.</p><p>It just so happened that Kong Ruozeng was someone who feared death.</p><p>&#x201C;Ruozeng, the men of our Kong Heavenly Clan fear nothing,&#x201D; Right at that moment, Kong Moyu suddenly spoke.</p><p>His intention was very obvious. Chu Feng had come here as a guest. Thus, even if they were truly capable of proving that Chu Feng was the intruder, it would still remain unsuitable for them to attack Chu Feng without sufficient proof.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had taken the initiative to prompt a battle to the death. With that, they would be able to borrow Kong Ruozeng&#x2019;s hands to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, please rest assured. I, Kong Ruozeng, will definitely not bring shame upon our Kong Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; Seeing that Kong Moyu had spoken, Kong Ruozeng immediately grew confident.</p><p>Thus, he turned his gaze around and then said loudly, &#x201C;The many seniors here today can bear witness to both Chu Feng and myself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I, Kong Ruozeng, only wanted to spar against Chu Feng. Yet, he insisted on a battle to the death. This is a condition that he proposed. I am merely agreeing to it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, even if I am to kill him later, it will not be our Kong Heavenly Clan treating our guest inconsiderately. Rather, it is him who proposed an unreasonable demand.&#x201D;</p><p>After Kong Ruozeng finished saying those words, Kong Moyu nodded in a satisfied manner. He could tell that Kong Ruozeng had understood the implied meaning behind his words, and had deliberately said those words to place Chu Feng in the wrong.</p><p>&#x201C;What a great &#x2018;not your Kong Heavenly Clan treating your guest inconsiderately&#x2019;. If that is the case, how are you to explain your manner of conduct towards my brother Wang Qiang?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are you to say that this is what you mean by treating your guests considerately?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It turns out that this is how the Kong Heavenly Clan treats their guests. Today, I, Chu Feng, have truly gained knowledge,&#x201D; Chu Feng sneered.</p><p>Although the bystanders did not say anything after hearing what Chu Feng said, they all nodded their heads to express their agreement.</p><p>In fact, many of the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan lowered their heads in shame.</p><p>After all, they had all seen what had happened earlier. As such, they were well-aware of who was in the right and who was in the wrong.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your nonsense. Since you want a battle to the death, come, let&#x2019;s start.&#x201D;</p><p>Kong Ruozeng knew that he would not win against Chu Feng in an argument. Thus, he decided not to speak, and directly started to attack Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A slash sliced across the sky, cutting the air itself in two. Even the clouds in the sky were sliced in two.</p><p>It was a Taboo Martial Skill. Although it was only a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill, it still possessed extremely impressive might.</p><p>At such close range, the Mortal Taboo Martial Skill was able to unleash its full potential.</p><p>It could be said that Kong Ruozeng had seized a decisive opportunity by attacking first.</p><p>&#x201C;Perfect timing.&#x201D;</p><p>However, faced with that attack, Chu Feng remained calm and composed.</p><p>He flipped his palm, and the Magma Emperor Sword appeared in his hand. He swept his sword toward the sky, and immediately brought forth a blaze.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The next moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s slash collided with Kong Ruozeng&#x2019;s slash.</p><p>Kong Ruozeng&#x2019;s slash was destroyed.</p><p>Yet, not only was Chu Feng&#x2019;s slash still present, it also possessed remnant power. At that moment, the remaining might of Chu Feng&#x2019;s slash was violently moving to cut down Kong Ruozeng.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, the guests present all began to voice praises. Some among them even started to applaud and cheer for Chu Feng.</p><p>The reason for that was because both Chu Feng and Kong Ruozeng had used Mortal Taboo Martial Skills. However, it was evident that Chu Feng&#x2019;s Mortal Taboo Martial Skill had surpassed Kong Ruozeng&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; Kong Ruozeng was not to be outdone. He did not dodge to avoid Chu Feng&#x2019;s slash, and instead waved his Incomplete Ancestral Armament again.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Once his slash was sent forth, the sky turned dark. Black clouds gathered. The earth trembled, and even space itself shattered from the vibration.</p><p>Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Kong Ruozeng had unleashed a very powerful Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, I&#x2019;ll play with you.&#x201D;</p><p>However, faced with Kong Ruozeng&#x2019;s attack, Chu Feng did not feel the slightest amount of fear. He took a step forward and shot forth a palm strike.</p><p>In an instant, the pitch black sky brightened. The black clouds that filled the sky dissipated in an instant.</p><p>Chu Feng had also unleashed an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Not only did his Earthen Taboo Martial Skill successfully defeat Kong Ruozeng&#x2019;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, there was once again lingering might moving toward Kong Ruozeng.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Kong Ruozeng did not have the time to unleash a counterattack. Thus, with no other option, he unleashed a movement martial skill and soared into the sky to avoid Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Trying to escape?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled coldly, and then soared into the sky after Kong Ruozeng.</p><p>&#x201C;Escape? What a joke! How could I, Kong Ruozeng, possibly fear you?&#x201D; Kong Ruozeng refuted with a sneer.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The very next moment, Chu Feng pointed at Kong Ruozeng with his Magma Emperor Sword. Then, a fire dragon was shot forth.</p><p>This fire dragon was several hundred meters long. Carrying with it a might as if it were capable of devouring the sky, it rushed toward Kong Ruozeng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
