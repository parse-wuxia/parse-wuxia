<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1869 - The First Person Since Ancient Times</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;ll dismember your body into ten thousand pieces!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a roar that contained overwhelming anger sounded. The two Utmost Exalted Elders of the Ximen Imperial Clan were using their Emperor Dragon Seals to clear the way and charge toward Chu Feng.</p><p>The boundless killing intent they were emitting simply did not appear like that of two old men. Instead, they looked more like two murderous gods as they charged toward Chu Feng.</p><p>Seeing that scene, those world spirits that were protecting Chu Feng hurriedly moved to intercept the two Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders. However, at that moment, the two Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders were filled with exceptional bravery and power. Even the Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits were unable to contain the two of them, and could only put forth all of their strength to withstand their onslaught of attacks.</p><p>It could be seen that Chu Feng&#x2019;s slaughter of the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had triggered their wrath. Thus, at that moment, they disregarded their own lives and were determined to kill Chu Feng. In rage, their battle power had also greatly increased.</p><p>[1. In chinese, triggering someone&#x2019;s wrath is known as touching the dragon&#x2019;s forbidden scale. Dragons possess tough scales, however, if one touches their inverse scale, they will feel pain and, in turn, wrath. Chinese Emperors are known as dragons. Thus, to go against the emperor is known to be touching the dragon&#x2019;s forbidden scale.]</p><p>Right at the moment when the world spirits were putting forth all their strength to block the two Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders, another of the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders appeared out of thin air.</p><p>When he stepped out of thin air, he was less than a thousand meters away from Chu Feng. He had already breached the layer of defense the world spirits had made. At that distance, he was completely capable of killing Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have you die!!!&#x201D; That Utmost Exalted Elder&#x2019;s eyes were deep red. His killing intent was boundless. His appearance simply appeared as if he wanted to eat Chu Feng alive.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The moment he appeared, he swatted his powerful hand at Chu Feng.</p><p>His attack brought forth an enormous amount of martial power that crashed toward Chu Feng. With a might capable of toppling the mountains and overturning the seas, his martial power took the form of a golden magic cloud. Being attacked by his martial power, even Chu Feng&#x2019;s Profound Firmament Annihilation started to distort. In the end, it exploded and dispersed.</p><p>It was too frightening. After all, that Utmost Exalted Elder was a rank four Martial Emperor. Regardless of how heaven-defying Chu Feng might be, he was still unable to withstand even a casual attack from that Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder. At that moment, Chu Feng felt the taste of death.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not time for him to die yet.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded. At the same time, the taste of death that had covered Chu Feng instantly disappeared. That Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder&#x2019;s attack had been blocked by someone.</p><p>Immediately afterward, an aged figure appeared and stood before that Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder. The Compass Immortal; the person who had arrived was the Compass Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Compass, it&#x2019;s you again!!!&#x201D; At that moment, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder was incomparably furious. To see that it was the Compass Immortal who prevented him from killing Chu Feng, he began to gnash his teeth so angrily that creaking sounds could be heard.</p><p>&#x201C;You wish to kill my disciple? You must first pass through me, his master,&#x201D; The Compass Immortal said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, I&#x2019;ll kill you first,&#x201D; That Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder&#x2019;s was already determined to kill. Without bothering with superfluous words, he immediately brandished his weapon and began to unleash attacks at the Compass Immortal.</p><p>As for the Compass Immortal, even though he was smiling, his eyes were also filled with boundless killing intent. His each and every attack was extremely ferocious and ruthless. He was like someone who hid daggers within his smiles.</p><p>&#x201C;Come, let&#x2019;s continue.&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze back to the Nangong Imperial Clan, Dongfang Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chiefs.</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>However, even though they were faced with Chu Feng&#x2019;s naked provocation, they, as three grand Clan Chiefs, actually did not dare to take up Chu Feng&#x2019;s challenge. Instead, they hurriedly backed away from him.</p><p>After seeing with their own eyes how Chu Feng had killed the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, they already knew very well that they were simply no match for Chu Feng. If they were to continue to fight him, they would likely also end up being killed.</p><p>That being said, when the bystanders saw the scene of the three Clan Chiefs cowering before Chu Feng, they all felt extremely complicated. Originally, they had thought that Chu Feng would definitely lose against the Four Great Imperial Clans&#x2019; four Clan Chiefs.</p><p>Yet, at that moment, Chu Feng had killed one of them, and the other three were so scared by Chu Feng that they were backing away from him repeatedly. This truly caused the crowd to become speechless.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, trash,&#x201D; Chu Feng sneered. Then, with a flash of his body, Chu Feng entered the void. He actually did not try to force the three Clan Chiefs into a corner, and instead turned to leave.</p><p>The three Clan Chiefs were all startled. They had been sharply sensing the space around them the entire time. Thus, they discovered that Chu Feng had not tried to attack them from the void. Instead, he was leaving.</p><p>They were confused as to why, when there was no one stopping Chu Feng at this moment, Chu Feng did not continue to attack and kill them, and instead turned to leave?</p><p>&#x201C;Clank ~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Not long after Chu Feng left, a cold ray flashed past the top of the city walls, the location where Baili Xuankong and the others from the Cyanwood Mountain were being hung. The metal chains that tied up Baili Xuankong and the others were all sliced apart by that cold ray.</p><p>The people from the Cyanwood Mountain who had been captured and hung on the city wall all landed to the ground and regained their freedom.</p><p>&#x201C;Ancestor, I&#x2019;ve startled you,&#x201D; After that cold ray flashed past, Chu Feng appeared beside Baili Xuankong and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it! He was actually creating a diversion!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, the three Clan Chiefs shouted in their hearts. Earlier, Chu Feng had left in the opposite direction from the city walls. This had led them to think that Chu Feng was trying to escape. However, never did they expect that Chu Feng had actually done that deliberately.</p><p>After Chu Feng left, he actually turned around and went to save Baili Xuankong and the others on the city wall.</p><p>At that moment, the three Clan Chiefs suddenly realized why Chu Feng had not seized the opportunity to kill them and had instead decided to leave.</p><p>The reason for that was because, to Chu Feng, saving Baili Xuankong and the others was much more important than the lives of the three of them.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, Chu Feng actually broke through a loophole and rescued them.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, the Four Great Imperial Clans&#x2019; Utmost Exalted Elders were all incomparably shocked.</p><p>After the defensive barrier had been broken through, the world spirits had immediately charged in. As such, they had not, had the opportunity to go and grab Baili Xuankong and the others as hostages.</p><p>However, at the same time, they had prevented the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the other experts from rescuing Baili Xuankong and the others. Thus, even though the King Monstrous Dragon Race&#x2019;s two War Faction&#x2019;s elders had charged toward the city wall immediately, they had been unable to save Baili Xuankong and the others.</p><p>Originally, they had thought this deadlock would continue. However, never did they expect that Chu Feng would break through a loophole and rescue the people that even rank four Martial Emperors failed to rescue.</p><p>&#x201C;Beautifully done.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng had saved Baili Xuankong and the others, the two War Faction&#x2019;s elders started to rejoice.</p><p>&#x201C;That boy actually became a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the Compass Immortal&#x2019;s eyes were shining. The reason for that was because he had discovered that it was no coincidence that Chu Feng had managed to secretly approach Baili Xuankong and the others.</p><p>Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. He had relied on his world spirit techniques to conceal his aura. That was why he had managed to bypass the Four Great Imperial Clan&#x2019;s defenses without them detecting him to stealthily approach Baili Xuankong and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng ignored the gazes from the crowd. With a wave of his sleeve, a golden spirit formation covered Baili Xuankong and the others.</p><p>Baili Xuankong and the others&#x2019; cultivation had been restricted. Chu Feng was trying to use his world spirit techniques to undo the restriction on their cultivations and restore their power to them.</p><p>Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm. &#x201C;Quickly, look, that&#x2019;s a Dragon Mark world spirit formation. That Chu Feng, he&#x2019;s&#x2026; he&#x2019;s actually a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens! That&#x2019;s actually real!&#x201D; When the crowd looked carefully at Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation, they discovered that there really were dragon-like veined patterns flowing through it.</p><p>A Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. At that moment, Chu Feng had revealed that&#x2026; he was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>His revelation had roiled up a violent storm in the already restless hearts of the crowd. At that moment, the crowd&#x2019;s hearts were incapable of calming down.</p><p>To the vast majority of the people, there were only ten Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism. Each and every one of them were extraordinary existences in the Holy Land of Martialism, and were deemed to be Immortals. Else, how could the Ten Immortals have come to be?</p><p>It was precisely because there were so few Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists that&#x2026; after Chu Feng killed the White-browed Immortal, there were people who had insulted him because of that. They said that Chu Feng was vicious, merciless and abominable to have killed a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>However, looking at it now, the crowd felt extremely astonished. Suddenly, they felt that Chu Feng possessed the qualifications to kill the White-browed Immortal.</p><p>The reason for that was because there had never been a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist as young as Chu Feng since ancient times.</p><p>White-browed Immortal? How could he possibly compare to Chu Feng? Even if he was killed by Chu Feng, it was not a pity for the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>After their moment of shock, someone cried out in alarm, &#x201C;The first person since ancient times, the first person since ancient times.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With how heaven-defying Chu Feng is, if he doesn&#x2019;t become the overlord, who else will be qualified to become the overlord?&#x201D; Overwhelmed, someone cried out.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
