<p><strong> Chapter 2342 - Outstanding Courage And Insight</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D;</p><p>The voice that was suddenly heard startled all of the people present.</p><p>The reason for that was because they were practically all certain that the spirit formation of the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother would be able to undo that grand defensive formation.</p><p>The fact that someone had suddenly declared that the spirit formation of the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother would be unable to undo that grand defensive formation at a time like this meant that they had gone against the opinion of the crowd.</p><p>At that moment, the first thing people thought was that the person that had spoken was boasting shamelessly.</p><p>Which is why they were curious as to who it was that actually said such a thing at such a time.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s him?!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon turning around to look, the already surprised crowd became completely astonished.</p><p>Logically, the people present were all grand individuals that had experienced a lot of major things. As such, they were not people that would be easily astonished.</p><p>However, upon seeing the people who&apos;d just arrived, they immediately revealed astonished expressions.</p><p>The reason for that was because the person who had arrived was someone that they would never have expected.</p><p>The reason for that was because the people that had arrived were Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>Merely, at that moment, the crowd were focused on one individual, Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x2018;Chu Feng?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How did he get here?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He is but a person of the younger generation, a mere rank five Half Martial Ancestor.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;With that cultivation, it shouldn&#x2019;t be possible for him to reach this place, no?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Could it be those two?&#x2019;</p><p>After a moment of astonishment, the crowd shifted their gazes from Chu Feng to Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>While it was true that Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong possessed cultivations above Chu Feng&#x2019;s, it remained that Wang Qiang was only a rank six Half Martial Ancestor, and Zhao Hong, the strongest of the three, was only a rank one Martial Ancestor.</p><p>With their cultivations, it was evident that none of them possessed the capability to reach this place.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, were you the one who said those words earlier?&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors asked with a cold voice. Her tone was filled with ill-intended tone.</p><p>&#x201C;So what if I am the one who said it?&#x201D; However, faced with this threat from the Four World Spirit Emperors&#x2019; mother, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression remained unchanged. He was completely calm.</p><p>&#x201C;Cheeky bastard, you shall be punished!!!&#x201D; As the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors spoke, her eyes were glowering wide open. She unleashed her rank seven Martial Ancestor-level aura and shot forth a vast oppressive might at Chu Feng.</p><p>Her attack was very ruthless. With Chu Feng&#x2019;s current level of cultivation, if he were to be struck by her oppressive might, even if he didn&#x2019;t die, he would likely suffer serious injuries and have his future prospects ruined.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, before the attack from the Four World Spiritist Emperor&#x2019;s mother could reach Chu Feng, an even stronger power blocked it.</p><p>The person who had acted to block her attack was actually Grandmaster Prophet.</p><p>&#x201C;You are too excessively ruthless. No matter what, you are a senior. How could you bully a junior like this?&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet said coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandmaster, it is true that Chu Feng is a member of the younger generation and I am a senior to him, but that is precisely the reason why I should properly teach him a lesson for speaking rudely to me,&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.</p><p>&#x201C;Speak rudely? Since when did speaking the truth become rude?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled mockingly.</p><p>&#x201C;You declared that the spirit formation I&#x2019;ve set up is unable to undo that grand defensive formation, is that not speaking rudely?&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said as she pointed at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;The spirit formation that you&#x2019;ve set up is unable to undo that grand formation to begin with. I have merely spoken the truth, how could that be considered speaking rudely?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a cold voice.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother grew even more furious.</p><p>Suddenly, an expert from the Immortal Sword School spoke. &#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, you should stop before you go too far. What little friend Chu Feng said earlier does not possess any disrespect toward you at all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Since you are able to declare that the spirit formation that others set up is useless, little friend Chu Feng is naturally also able to call your spirit formation&#x2019;s efficiency into question. Since when did something like that become disrespect towards one&#x2019;s senior? If that is disrespect, wouldn&#x2019;t that mean that juniors would not be allowed to say the truth before their seniors, and would only flatter them?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, even if little friend Chu Feng really did speak rudely, you shouldn&#x2019;t attack him that ruthlessly. You simply wanted to kill little friend Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, are your actions against little friend Chu Feng not excessive? Even if you detest him, you shouldn&#x2019;t reveal it so obviously, no?&#x201D;</p><p>A scene that the World Spiritist Saintess did not expect actually occurred. Many of the people present began to speak on behalf of Chu Feng and mock her.</p><p>There was naturally a reason why the crowd would react like that.</p><p>Firstly, Chu Feng was no ordinary member of the younger generation. The crowd present all wanted to become acquaintances with Chu Feng. By speaking on his behalf, they would be able to become closer to Chu Feng.</p><p>Furthermore, the attitude the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother had displayed earlier was truly too arrogant and aggressive. Her attitude had caused many people to feel dissatisfied. As such, they were seizing the opportunity to lower her grandeur.</p><p>&#x201C;What? I attacked him maliciously? I detest him? You all are simply babbling nonsense,&#x201D; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother said in a very displeased manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng defeated your four sons on Mount Cloud Crane. That is something that everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm knows about.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You, on the other hand, are famous for pampering your sons. Thus, everyone already knows that, in the future, you would most likely attack little friend Chu Feng for your sons.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for what you did earlier, it clearly indicated that what we guessed was correct.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, I must say, you are truly disappointing,&#x201D; That peak Martial Ancestor from the Immortal Sword School said while shaking his head.</p><p>At the same time, many people began to sigh mockingly.</p><p>&#x201C;You all!!!&#x201D; Being jointly attacked by the crowd, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother was so furious that her complexion turned pale, causing her ugly old face to begin to twitch nonstop.</p><p>Filled with endless anger, she naturally did not plan to drop the subject just like that. Thus, she looked to Chu Feng again, pointed at him and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you said that my spirit formation will be unable to undo that grand defensive formation. If I am able to undo it, I want you to kneel before me and publicly apologize to me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What will you do if you fail to undo the grand defensive formation?&#x201D; Chu Feng replied calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;If I fail to undo the grand defensive formation, I will publicly apologize to you,&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.</p><p>&#x201C;W-wait a moment,&#x201D; Right at that moment, Wang Qiang spoke, &#x201C;Since y-you s-said that Chu Feng needed to kneel w-while apologizing if he l-loses the bet, s-shouldn&#x2019;t you also apologize w-while kneeling too i-if you lose the bet?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Since you want to bet, it should naturally be an equal bet,&#x201D; Zhao Hong added.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. If I lose, I will kneel and apologize to you. Chu Feng, do you dare accept?&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;If you dare, then I will naturally dare,&#x201D; Chu Feng said calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat who doesn&#x2019;t know about the immensity of the heaven and earth, prepare yourself to apologize to this Saintess,&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was filled with confidence. She turned around and continued to operate her spirit formation. She planned to prove herself to the crowd.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, his expression remained unchanged. There was not the slightest trace of worry.</p><p>Since Chu Feng dared to say something like that, it would naturally mean that he possessed absolute confidence.</p><p>The crowd took note of Chu Feng&#x2019;s fearless behavior. At that moment, they felt even more certain that Chu Feng was an extraordinary individual.</p><p>After all, his courage and insight were things that ordinary people from the younger generation did not possess.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I am called Duan Chunchang. I am an elder of the Immortal Sword School,&#x201D; That peak Martial Ancestor from the Immortal Sword School who had questioned the World Spiritist Saintess many times flew over to Chu Feng and initiated a greeting.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the Buddha&#x2019;s Heavenly Temple, Zhou Heavenly Clan, Kong Heavenly Clan and even that Grandmaster Prophet also moved to greet Chu Feng.</p><p>Although they were merely greeting him, it was an extraordinary thing capable of shaking the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for a person of the younger generation like Chu Feng to be able to cause so many grand characters to come and greet him of their own accord.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he politely greeted them back.</p><p>After all, these people here were all renowned and powerful individuals in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Regardless of what sort of intention they had in coming to greet him, Chu Feng must still display the sort of politeness and respect that a member of the younger generation should have.</p><p>After courteously greeting one another, Grandmaster Prophet asked curiously, &#x201C;Little friends, how did the three of you manage to reach this place?&#x201D;</p><p>Following that question, the crowd all turned their curious gazes over. They all wanted to know how Chu Feng and his friends, three people from the younger generation, were able to pass through those traps and mechanisms that should be impossible for them to pass through.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
