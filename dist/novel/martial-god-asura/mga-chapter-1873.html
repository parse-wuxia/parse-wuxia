<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1873 - The Curtain Drops</strong></p><p>When Nangong Longjian&#x2019;s words left his mouth, Nangong Beidou, the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief all looked to one another. Then, they walked through the air and arrived before Chu Feng.</p><p>They clasped their fists at Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, earlier, it was our clans that were in the wrong. We hope that little friend Chu Feng will forgive us.&#x201D;</p><p>While their courteousness was only for show, it remained that they had apologized to Chu Feng.</p><p>For them, with their statuses, to actually apologize to Chu Feng, it could be seen that they still deeply feared Chu Feng. In turn, this displayed how sincere they were in wanting to reconcile with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t mention the past anymore. I only hope that you three Clan Chiefs will no longer make things difficult for this Chu Feng, and will instead become friends with this Chu Feng,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a light smile. His words contained hidden implications.</p><p>&#x201C;Most definitely. From today onward, little friend Chu Feng will only be our friend and not our foe.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s friends are also our friends,&#x201D; The Three Clan Chiefs said in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;I hope that you three Clan Chiefs are capable of doing what you all said,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Even though they had reconciled, Chu Feng still bore ill feelings against these people who had been so determined to kill him.</p><p>Faced with Chu Feng acting in such a manner, the three Clan Chiefs could only smile bitterly. After all, they knew that they were the ones in the wrong. Thus, they all pledged, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, there&#x2019;s no need to say anymore. You merely need to watch how we act in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng said via voice transmission, &#x201C;Three Clan Chiefs, there is a matter that this Chu Feng wonders whether or not you all might be able to tell me about.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What might this matter be?&#x201D; The three Clan Chiefs replied in unison through voice transmission.</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly who is it that sold out our Cyanwood Mountain?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Regarding that, we do not know. Only Ximen Baiyuan knows,&#x201D; The three Clan Chiefs replied in the same sort of manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; Even though he had not managed to determine who the traitor was, Chu Feng still thanked them. The reason for that was because he had obtained helpful information from them.</p><p>After bearing witness to Chu Feng reconciling with the Four Great Imperial Clans, many of the people present revealed smiles. They had truly never expected for such a peak confrontation to conclude in such a manner.</p><p>However, as they were all humans, to be at peace with one another was the best. This ending was actually the one that the crowd longed for the most.</p><p>Seeing the people that were previously battling one another smiling at one another, seeing how their hatred for one another was erased by their smiles, not to mention the people involved in this battle, even the bystanders were feeling very joyous.</p><p>However&#x2026; at this moment, the crowd from the Ximen Imperial Clan were feeling very upset. The Nangong Imperial Clan, Dongfang Imperial Clan and Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chiefs had all gone to personally apologize to Chu Feng. Only their Ximen Imperial Clan did not do so. As for the reason why, it was because their Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had already been killed by Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Ximen Imperial Clan, are you all not going to express your apology?&#x201D; Right at this moment, Nangong Longjian spoke. Evidently, he was not planning to let the Ximen Imperial Clan leave like this. He had wanted the Ximen Imperial Clan to offer their apology to Chu Feng too.</p><p>In response, Ximen Baiyuan put his Imperial Armament away and walked over to Chu Feng. Although he had arrived before Chu Feng, he was only standing there. He did not make any courteous gestures, nor did he offer an apology. In fact, there was not even a trace of apology on his face. Evidently&#x2026; he was still incapable of apologizing to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;As this is already a thing of the past, I also do not wish to dig into this excessively. As long as senior Ximen is willing to answer two of my questions, I will not demand an apology from the Ximen Imperial Clan,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What are your questions? Ask away,&#x201D; Hearing those words, Ximen Baiyuan&#x2019;s expression improved greatly. Even though he deeply hated Chu Feng, Chu Feng had still given him a way out of this difficult situation.</p><p>&#x201C;My first question is, exactly what is the origin of the Dark Hall? Please answer me honestly,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It was the Dark Hall that came to find us. They said that they would help us. The Imperial Armament used as the bounty for you was also provided by them. Merely, they did not hand the Imperial Armament to us, and we did not obtain any Imperial Armaments from them. It was merely a verbal promise between us. Looking at it now, they simply never planned to provide us with the Imperial Armament. They were merely deceiving us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the origin of the Dark Hall, we also do not know. Every single time, it was them who contacted us. We were simply incapable of finding them. However, I am able to provide you with a clue,&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan said.</p><p>&#x201C;What is that clue?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;The people from the Dark Hall wore masks. Thus, I do not know their identities. However, I do know the identity of a single person from the Dark Hall,&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan said with a low voice. Only Chu Feng was able to hear what he was saying.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is it?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Hundred Transformations Clay Man,&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan said.</p><p>&#x201C;So it&#x2019;s actually him,&#x201D; Chu Feng naturally remembered the Hundred Transformations Clay Man. Back on the Gong Ba Plains, it was precisely because that Hundred Transformations Clay Man had disguised himself as Chu Feng that Hong Qiang had ended up falling for the Four Great Imperial Clans&#x2019; trap.</p><p>&#x201C;What is your second question?&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan took the initiative to ask. This time around, he was not speaking with a low voice. Instead, he asked with a voice that all the crowd could hear.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is the person that sold out our Cyanwood Mountain?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that you also know that someone sold out your Cyanwood Mountain,&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;That is something that anyone could guess. Furthermore, I know that the person who sold our Cyanwood Mountain out is currently among the people here,&#x201D; Chu Feng swept his eyes over the people from the Cyanwood Mountain behind him.</p><p>Even though these people had been held hostage the entire time, Chu Feng knew that the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s traitor was hidden within them.</p><p>&#x201C;So what? I will never tell you who that person is. That person decided to submit to us and also helped us. As such, I am obligated to protect that person,&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan smiled lightly. Then, he said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, even though we have reconciled, our Ximen Imperial Clan and you are destined to never be able to become friends with one another. Thus, I will not invite you to stay here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if you wanted me to stay, I would not be willing to stay,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he turned to Baili Xuankong and the others and said, &#x201C;Lord Headmaster, let&#x2019;s return home.&#x201D;</p><p>Thus, the curtains dropped on the grudges between Chu Feng and the Four Great Imperial Clans. Chu Feng and the others all left.</p><p>The Nangong Imperial Clan, Dongfang Imperial Clan and Beitang Imperial Clan also left in succession.</p><p>After the great battle was over, only trash that was scattered all over the ground remained. The Ximen Imperial Clan was left heavily damaged with holes all over. In this battle, the one who had suffered the most was none other than the Ximen Imperial Clan.</p><p>Inside the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s main palace.</p><p>The Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s main palace was originally splendorous and majestic. However, due to the battle, it had become somewhat bleak with defeat.</p><p>However, at that moment, the Ximen Imperial Clan was in no mood to repair their city or the palace. After all, their Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had been killed. Furthermore, not even an intact corpse had been left behind. As such, the people from the Ximen Imperial Clan were grieving.</p><p>&#x201C;Great grandfather, you must avenge my father,&#x201D; Ximen Feixue was kneeling on the ground. He was weeping bitter tears.</p><p>&#x201C;Milord, we cannot let Chu Feng get away with this. We must avenge Lord Clan Chief,&#x201D; Many of the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s upper echelons were also kneeled on the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Avenge? How are you all going to avenge him? Are you all capable of defeating Chu Feng? Are you all capable of defeating Nangong Longjian?&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan asked with a loud voice. Disappointment filled his tone.</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D; At that moment, the crowd spoke no more. Indeed, they did not possess the ability to get revenge. They were incapable of even defeating Chu Feng. As such, there was no need to mention Nangong Longjian.</p><p>&#x201C;A bunch of trash. If it wasn&#x2019;t for you all insisting on making that Chu Feng your enemy, we would not have provoked all this trouble, and all those people from our Ximen Imperial Clan would not have been killed,&#x201D; Ximen Baiyuan angrily berated them.</p><p>&#x201C;Puu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Ximen Baiyuan vomited out a mouthful of blood. Then, he fell from the dragon throne. In merely an instant, his health became incomparably weak.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
