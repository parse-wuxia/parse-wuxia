<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1372 - Your End</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Bastard, do you know what this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter is? We&#x2019;re using that to bet for your Sealing Glacial Water and Sealing Glacier, yet you actually dare to say that you&#x2019;re dissatisfied with it?! Are you not too excessively greedy?!&#x201D; Sun Lei said with a great amount of anger.</p><p>&#x201C;Hah, earlier you used that same Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter as the gambling stake for the Sealing Glacial Water. After that, you added both the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter and the Sealing Glacial Water to bet for the Sealing Glacier.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What does that mean? That means that the value of the Sealing Glacier is greatly superior to that of the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And now, I possess both the Sealing Glacial Water and the Sealing Glacier. Yet, you wish to use the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter as a gambling stake for the both of them. Do you take me for a fool or are you a fool?&#x201D; Chu Feng sneered.</p><p>&#x201C;The value of the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter is inferior to the Sealing Glacier? Huang Feng had only deliberately accepted that as the bet because he feared that Zhou Long would not dare to bet. It is nothing more than that.&#x201D; Sun Lei spoke with a loud voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Sssssss~~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After he finished saying those words, the crowd began to hiss in dissatisfaction. Even though they all knew that Huang Feng had laid a trap earlier, it was still a bit too excessive to speak of it this obviously.</p><p>As for that Zhou Long, his current expression was extremely ugly. That was because he had truly and utterly disgraced himself; he had been played for a complete fool by them.</p><p>At this moment, Sun Lei realized that he had misspoken. However, all of this had been forced by Chu Feng. As such, he began to detest Chu Feng even more. He felt that he had been played for a fool by a piece of trash from the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>&#x201C;It is you all who set up the conditions for the gambles earlier. I am merely going according to the fixed price that you all have presented. No matter what others might think, I can only see that the Sealing Glacier is more valuable than the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;You are inverting right and wrong, twisting words and forcing logic!&#x201D; Sun Lei snarled in anger.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care about what you say, either way, I will not gamble with you if you only use the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter as the gambling stake,&#x201D; Chu Feng spread his arms and shrugged his shoulders. He displayed an appearance of &#x2018;there&#x2019;s nothing you can do about it.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;Fuck! Are you going to fucking gamble with me or not?!&#x201D; Sun Lei was truly enraged. He actually began to force Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your profanity. While I can gamble with you, you must possess the qualifications. Come speak to me again after you manage to gather enough to present as a gambling stake. Else, scram back to where you came from, your granddaddy here does not have the time to play around with you,&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression sunk as he said those words.</p><p>&#x201C;Fuck! Your daddy shall use his life to bet with you,&#x201D; Sun Lei snarled once again.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed. Then, he said, &#x201C;Your life? Is it even valuable? As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, your life is not even worth a single High Quality Strength Restoring Pellet.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re truly courting death!&#x201D; After hearing what Chu Feng said, Sun Lei was so enraged that he began to gnash his teeth in anger. His complexion turned green, and blue veins began to appear on his face. He was truly and utterly enraged.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; Suddenly, Sun Lei held his hand in a fist and shot forth. His surging martial power brought with it rising dust and numerous waves of energy maelstroms as it swept toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz.&#x201D;</p><p>However, before his ferocious fist strike could reach Chu Feng, an astonishing power suddenly appeared. That power was truly astonishing. After Sun Lei&#x2019;s fist strike struck that astonishing power, it was as if a stone had hit the sea, sinking into it without a trace. Without causing any energy ripples, not even a speck, it disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Sun Lei, little friend Chu Feng is our Sealing Ancient Village&#x2019;s distinguished guest. This old man will not allow anyone to attack little friend Chu Feng in our Sealing Ancient Village,&#x201D; Old Village Chief Ma spoke. It turned out that the person who had stopped Sun Lei&#x2019;s attack earlier was him.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your nonsense. Who doesn&#x2019;t know that your Sealing Ancient Village has never interfered with the grudges and grievances of your guests. What you&#x2019;re doing right now is simply shielding him,&#x201D; Sun Lei said angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;re saying it like that, then I might as well be frank with you too. Yes, I am deliberately shielding little friend Chu Feng,&#x201D; Old Village Chief Ma spoke in a very calm manner.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Sun Lei was so enraged that his lips started to tremble. However, there was nothing he could say. Who was the Old Village Chief Ma? No matter what, he was still the number one expert in the Sealing Ancient Village. Even for their World Spiritist Alliance, it was not as if just any one of their management world spiritists would be able to contend against Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>As for him, he was nothing more than a member of the younger generation. Even if he possessed strong battle power, what difference did it make? Other than becoming angry, there was nothing that he could do.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Didn&#x2019;t Old Village Chief Ma want to drive Chu Feng out earlier? Why would he be protecting him now?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps it&#x2019;s because Chu Feng won against Huang Feng. Old Village Chief Ma must&#x2019;ve found out that Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques are very powerful, and that he is a rare genius, so he decided to salvage the relationship between him and Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After all, Chu Feng is a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. If the Sealing Ancient Village were to fall out with him too deeply, it wouldn&#x2019;t be a good thing for them. The way I see it, Old Village Chief Ma is planning to redeem himself.&#x201D;</p><p>Compared to Sun Lei, the crowd that had seen Old Village Chief Ma driving out Chu Feng earlier were all confused. They began to spiritedly discuss about what was happening right now, and guessed at the reason Old Village Chief Ma had stepped in to protect Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, these are all of the belongings that us four siblings possess. There are a total of four high quality medicine concocting cauldrons, four high quality weaponry refinement cauldrons, nine top quality Royal Armaments, a million eight hundred and thirty-one thousand five hundred and sixty one martial beads, and many different assorted rare treasures and countless materials.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I know that even if we were to add all of them together, they would not be as valuable as a piece of Sealing Glacier. However, this is all the wealth that we possess. Now, I am going to use it as the gambling stake, are you willing to accept?&#x201D; Huang Feng said as he held out four Cosmos Sacks.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll also take out all of my wealth. Do you dare to gamble or not?&#x201D; Seeing this, Sun Lei also took out his Cosmos Sack.</p><p>It seemed that in order to win back the items that they had lost, the five of them were planning to put forth all of their hard-earned savings.</p><p>&#x201C;Although the gambling stake is still insufficient, there&#x2019;s at least a sufficient amount of sincerity from you five. I shall reluctantly gamble with you all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I will only gamble with you all once more. Furthermore, in order to prevent you all from acting shamelessly and refusing to admit your loss later, we will hand all of our gambling stakes to senior Ma and have him safekeep them for the time being.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Whoever wins shall go to him to obtain the spoils of war. As for the losers, they shall scram out from this place. Do not continue to tangle on shamelessly. Although it is up to your own individual character if you are unable to take a defeat with grace, if you were to do that, then what you would be disgracing would not only be yourself,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, the one who is unable to take defeat with grace will definitely not be me,&#x201D; As Sun Lei spoke, he threw his Cosmos Sack to Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>Following him, Huang Feng, Huang Ping, Huang Lang and Huang Jing also threw their Cosmos Sacks to Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>Holding the five Cosmos Sacks in his hand, Old Village Chief Ma turned to Chu Feng and nodded. His intention was very clear; he was indicating to Chu Feng that there were indeed a lot of treasures in these Cosmos Sacks, and that Huang Feng and the others had not lied to him.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng did not know Old Village Chief Ma and Old Village Chief Ma had even wrongly accused him and Wang Qiang earlier, Chu Feng did not feel that Old Village Chief Ma was a bad person. Thus, he was willing to place his trust in Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng waved his arm and handed the vase that contained the hundred thousand drops of Sealing Glacial Water to Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>&#x201C;When do we begin?&#x201D; Sun Lei asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It has already started,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied.</p><p>Hearing those words, Sun Lei smiled. His smile was filled with confidence. Then, he slowly lifted his arms and crossed his hands. He cracked his knuckles, shook his shoulders and cracked his neck. &#x201C;Crack, crack, crack,&#x201D; sounds began to emit from his entire body like a string of small firecrackers.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you should prepare yourself to be knocked about. I, Sun Lei, have never been one to be lenient with my attacks,&#x201D; After finishing his preparations, Sun Lei spoke with an ice-cold tone.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh.&#x201D; After he finished saying those words, Sun Lei&#x2019;s body shifted. He turned into a ray of golden light and exploded toward Chu Feng.</p><p>The ray of light that Sun Lei turned into was filled with power. It was as if it was capable of ripping apart space itself. The speed of that ray of light was extremely fast. In merely the blink of an eye, it arrived in front of Chu Feng and covered him completely.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boom!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately afterward, wave upon wave of explosions that contained ferocious energy ripples began to sound in succession.</p><p>In a flash, the energy ripples and explosions covered the crowd and turned the radius of several miles around them into one of pitch darkness. The battle of martial powers had made this region look as if it had entered doomsday. It was extremely terrifying. As for the cause of all this, it was created by Sun Lei&#x2019;s attacks.</p><p>Seeing that the situation was bad, Old Village Chief Ma, who was concerned about Chu Feng&#x2019;s safety, immediately waved his sleeve. This wave of his sleeve brought forth a fierce gale. The gale dispersed the frantic energy ripples that covered the region.</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens, this&#x2026;&#x201D; However, when the energy ripples were dissipated by the gale, at the time when the crowd was able to clearly see everything, not a single person present was not stunned. Even Old Village Chief Ma, who had acted to save Chu Feng, was stunned.</p><p>That was because at this moment, Sun Lei who had previously launched that attack at Chu Feng was actually lying on the ground. Not only did he have a bloody nose and a swollen face, his entire body was covered in blood; he had turned into just a body of blood.</p><p>However, when the crowd looked to Chu Feng, his body was covered with a domineering lightning. Furthermore, being covered by the lightning, his cultivation had reached the level of a rank seven Martial King.</p><p>At this time, the lightning that covered Chu Feng was gradually dissipating. After the lightning disappeared, Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation returned to rank five Martial King.</p><p>At the time when the lightning disappeared, Chu Feng&#x2019;s appearance came before everyone&#x2019;s line of sight. At this time, the crowd was able to clearly see that there was not the smallest trace of blood on Chu Feng. He was actually not injured in the slightest.</p><p>However, that was not the important aspect. The important aspect was that the current Chu Feng was actually stepping on Sun Lei with one foot. Furthermore, he suddenly raised his hand and held it into a fist. With a &#x2018;putt&#x2019; sound, he smashed his powerful fist into Sun Lei&#x2019;s mouth, crushing it completely.</p><p>&#x201C;Firstly, you should not have insulted my mother.&#x201D; [1. The most common chinese equivalent of fuck/damn it/fuck it literally means &#x2018;his/her mother.&#x2019; This is the same swear word that Sun Lei used. So&#x2026; I guess you could say that he insulted Chu Feng&#x2019;s mother. Not really, but sure...]</p><p>&#x201C;Secondly, you should not have competed with me in battle power.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you&#x2019;ve done both of them. Thus, this is your end,&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to Sun Lei who he was stepping on and coldly said those words.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
