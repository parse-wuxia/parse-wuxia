<p><strong> Chapter 2270 - Eagerness To Protect One&#x2019;s Master</strong></p><p>Invisible oppressive might filled this region. Although the oppressive might could not be seen, it could be felt.</p><p>It was as if a Grim Reaper was quietly descending upon this region.</p><p>Even the weather was affected by the invisible oppressive might. Black clouds began to surge about as rolling thunder began to be heard.</p><p>That oppressive might was not from the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master, nor was it from Su Jingrui. The reason for that was because the two of them, and even the management elders present, all knew very well that they did not possess the level of strength to be able to emit oppressive might that powerful.</p><p>Furthermore, that oppressive might was coming from inside the forbidden area. It was that oppressive might that had shattered the forbidden area&#x2019;s entrance gate.</p><p>Thus, everyone present subconsciously felt that a frightening existence had left the forbidden area.</p><p>However, why would the forbidden area possess such a frightening existence?</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, red light suddenly appeared in the sky. The red light surged about and soon filled the entire sky, turning it crimson like blood.</p><p>As the crowd looked to the crimson gaseous flames that filled the sky, they felt as if they could smell the dense reek of blood. It was truly frightening and sinister.</p><p>As the crimson gaseous flames rolled about, the invisible oppressive might took visible form. In the end, the crimson gaseous flames turned into an enormous crimson face.</p><p>That enormous face covered the sky and hid the earth. Its eyes were eerie, and its appearance twisted. It was simply the face of a demon.</p><p>Ugly, sinister, gloomy, oppressive and frighteningly cold.</p><p>At that moment, that enormous face opened its large mouth and revealed its sharp fangs.</p><p>With low ear-piercing howls, it began to move toward the crowd to engulf them. It was planning to devour all of the people present at once.</p><p>&#x201C;What exactly is that?&#x201D;</p><p>As they looked to the enormous and frightening face, the people present all started to panic. Even the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui, the two grand rank eight Martial Ancestor level existences, revealed frightened expressions.</p><p>The reason for that was because regardless of who it was, they would only feel one sort of sensation from the enormous and frightening face and those sharp fangs -- the sensation of powerlessness.</p><p>The aura of death was so very close to them. When death finally arrived, they were simply powerless to resist.</p><p>&#x201C;Could today be the end of our Sunset Cloud Valley?&#x201D;</p><p>The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master revealed an expression of despair. It was not that he did not possess any integrity, nor was it because he did not wish to resist. Rather, he simply did not even possess the strength to resist right now.</p><p>All of the people present acted as if they were petrified. They had lost all battle power, and could only watch powerlessly as the enormous mouth moved toward them with the intention of devouring their lives.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at the moment when everyone felt they would be killed, that enormous demon-like mouth suddenly turned into a vortex.</p><p>The vortex started to surge and rage before finally disappearing into thin air.</p><p>It was not only that enormous and frightening face that disappeared, even the suffocating sensation the crowd had felt earlier disappeared along with it.</p><p>The shattered space started to fuse together. Soon, that region of space regained its former tranquility. It was as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p>However, the hearts of the crowd were unable regain their tranquility.</p><p>The reason for that was because they all knew that the enormous and frightening face&#x2019;s enormous mouth that was moving toward them to devour them was no ordinary mouth. Instead, it was simply the gates of hell. As long as they were devoured by that mouth, they would have no hope of survival.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, what was that earlier?&#x201D; A management elder asked courageously. When he said those words, his voice was trembling slightly.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know either,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master shook his head. He truly had no idea what that thing earlier was. He was also pondering it right now.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, why would such a frightening thing appear from the forbidden area? Exactly what is going on?&#x201D;</p><p>Many other management elders began to question their Lord Valley Master. The reason for that was because the scene earlier had truly been too dangerous.</p><p>Not only did it concern their own safety, it also concerned the safety of the entire Sunset Cloud Valley. As such, they wanted to know the truth.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master has already said that he doesn&#x2019;t know. Do you all not understand that?!&#x201D; Right at that moment, Su Jingrui shouted angrily.</p><p>Upon hearing his shout, the management elders all shut their mouths. No one dared to ask anything anymore.</p><p>Even though they were all very concerned about the safety of the Sunset Cloud Valley, they also knew that they had truly gone beyond their authority earlier. If their Lord Valley Master did not wish to tell them, they did not possess the authority to insist on asking.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, this is bad!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Elder Ning Shuang rushed out of the forbidden area in a panic.</p><p>&#x201C;Ning Shuang?&#x201D; Upon seeing Elder Ning Shuang, the expression of the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master changed. Together with Su Jingrui, they rushed toward Ning Shuang.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, Lord Elder, please follow this subordinate inside. Little friend Chu Feng is on the verge of dying,&#x201D; After Elder Ning Shuang said those words, he hurriedly turned around and began to lead the way.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Upon hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master immediately revealed a nervous expression and followed Elder Ning Shuang into the forbidden area.</p><p>On their way there, Elder Ning Shuang began to explain the general situation of what had happened to the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui.</p><p>After they found out that Li Rui&#x2019;s master had died, the two of them were both very shocked.</p><p>They felt even more shocked when they found out that Li Rui&#x2019;s master was killed by an old cat.</p><p>When Ning Shaung explained to them that the mysterious old cat declared that it had plundered Zhan Haichuan&#x2019;s tomb, threatened Xu Yiyi and him about the consequences of going against it and used a mysterious technique to torture Chu Feng, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui immediately recalled the demon-like giant face that had appeared from the forbidden area earlier.</p><p>They both felt that the old cat Elder Ning Shuang spoke of was the creator of that giant face.</p><p>They felt that old cat was deliberately demonstrating its might to the people of the Sunset Cloud Valley. Like how it had threatened Elder Ning Shuang and Xu Yiyi earlier, the old cat was demonstrating its might to tell the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley to not provoke it.</p><p>It was declaring that if the Sunset Cloud Valley were to provoke it, eliminating the Sunset Cloud Valley would be an effortless task for it.</p><p>&#x201C;Why would such a frightening existence suddenly appear in our Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s forbidden area?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did it enter our forbidden area? Exactly what happened in here?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master had a very ugly expression.</p><p>After all, what had happened was truly no small matter at all. In fact, it concerned the continued existence of their Sunset Cloud Valley. As such, he had no choice but to be worried.</p><p>&#x201C;Only little friend Chu Feng knows what has happened. No, his world spirit might know about it too,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master nodded. Then, he increased his speed.</p><p>As the three men hastened their journey, they finally arrived at the location where Chu Feng had been injured.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng was still howling in pain. Merely, his voice was no longer loud and clear like before. It was not that he was not in as much pain as before. Rather, he was in so much pain that he did not even have the strength to scream.</p><p>&#x201C;Let me have a look,&#x201D; As the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master spoke, he moved toward Chu Feng to diagnose his situation.</p><p>Unfortunately, after diagnosing Chu Feng&#x2019;s state, he started to frown, and revealed an expression of helplessness.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, how is it? Exactly what&#x2019;s going on with Chu Feng?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi asked anxiously.</p><p>&#x201C;I am unable to tell,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master shook his head helplessly.</p><p>&#x201C;I have a medicinal pellet that could relieve pain. We can give it to him and see if it helps,&#x201D; Su Jingrui said.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know what is meant by prescribing the right medicine for one&#x2019;s illness?! When you want to prescribe Chu Feng medicine when you do not even know what happened to Chu Feng, are you capable of taking responsibility if he dies after taking the medicine?!&#x201D; At that moment, Her Lady Queen shouted angrily.</p><p>She walked over to Chu Feng&#x2019;s side and shouted, &#x201C;All of you, move aside. Enough of your fake sincerity and concern here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you think that I do not know what you all are thinking. You all just want to know what that damned cat was, no?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you all want to know, then wait until Chu Feng wakes up and ask him personally then. However, if Chu Feng doesn&#x2019;t wake up, don&#x2019;t think about knowing anything.&#x201D;</p><p>Once Eggy said those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master, Su Jingrui and even Elder Ning Shuang started to frown.</p><p>They were all able to tell what Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s intention was.</p><p>That is, if Chu Feng would be fine, then everything would be fine. However, if something were to happen to Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen would not tell the Sunset Cloud Valley anything.</p><p>Although Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s attitude was very vile, they found it hard to blame her.</p><p>After all, Her Lady Queen was saying those words out of eagerness to protect her master.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
