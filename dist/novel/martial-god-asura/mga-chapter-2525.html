<p><strong> Chapter 2525 - Great Mysterious Enemy</strong></p><p>&#x201C;That poison was given to me by someone. I do not know who that person is. All I know is that he was wearing a blue gown that covered his face. As such, I was unable to see his appearance. However, I am certain that he is a True Immortal-level expert,&#x201D; Kong Doumoyuan said.</p><p>&#x201C;Was there any distinctive property to that blue gown?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;There was nothing distinctive. That blue gown was very clean. Not only did it not have any embroidery, it didn&#x2019;t even have any patterns,&#x201D; Kong Doumoyuan said.</p><p>&#x201C;Why would he give you the poison without any reason?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Kong Doumoyuan started to hesitate.</p><p>&#x201C;Speak!!!&#x201D; Chu Feng shouted at him.</p><p>&#x201C;He gave me the poison so that I could take care of you all. He said&#x2026; that if I am to encounter you all and I&#x2019;m unable to win, then use the poison, as it will definitely be able to kill you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back then, when I was fighting against Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, I saw that they were no match for me and thus thought the poison to be useless.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But, it remained that person had given me the poison so that I could use it on all you. Thus, I decided that I should not waste the poison, and ended up using it on Wang Qiang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That was what happened. After that, I never encountered that individual again. I also do not know who he is or why he wanted to help me take care of you all,&#x201D; Kong Doumoyuan was nervous. He was deeply afraid that Chu Feng would go back on his word and kill him.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he began to walk toward the distance. Zhao Hong silently followed him.</p><p>When Chu Feng was healing Kong Doumoyuan&#x2019;s injuries, he had actually left behind a spirit formation on him. That spirit formation was capable of determining whether or not Kong Doumoyuan was lying.</p><p>Thus, he was certain that Kong Doumoyuan had spoken the truth and did not lie to them.</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng and Zhao Hong really left, Kong Doumoyuan was overjoyed. Then, the corners of his mouth rose into a strange smile.</p><p>He thought in his heart, &#x2018;What fools. They actually really spared me. However, I dare to guarantee that your decision to spare me today will be something that you will regret the most!&#x2019;</p><p>The more Kong Doumoyuan thought about it, the more pleased he became. He had done all this and caused so many people to die. Yet he, the person that Chu Feng and Zhao Hong wanted to kill the most, actually survived. He was feeling overjoyed.</p><p>Furthermore, with Kong Doumoyuan&#x2019;s character, he would naturally not feel grateful toward Chu Feng and Zhao Hong merely because they spared his life.</p><p>On the contrary, he was planning on how to take revenge on Chu Feng and Zhao Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng waved his hand, and a ray of light flew out from his hand. It was flying toward Kong Doumoyuan.</p><p>It was a blade ray formed with martial power. Furthermore, its speed was extremely fast. With a &#x2018;puu,&#x2019; it pierced into Kong Doumoyuan&#x2019;s dantian.</p><p>At that moment, Kong Doumoyuan&#x2019;s cultivation was completely destroyed.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you broke your promise!!!&#x201D; Kong Doumoyuan shouted with incomparable rage.</p><p>At that moment, he truly felt as if he was in between heaven and hell.</p><p>He had originally thought that he had escaped a calamity. Yet, his cultivation that he had trained bitterly for years to obtain was suddenly crippled. To him, this was something even more painful than being killed.</p><p>Faced with the furious Kong Doumoyuan, Chu Feng laughed coldly. &#x201C;I only agreed to not kill you. I never said that I would not harm you. I&#x2019;m already being merciful in only crippling your cultivation.&#x201D;</p><p>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng flew away.</p><p>At that moment, Zhao Hong, who was previously feeling depressed, revealed an enchanting smile.</p><p>Although she was unable to kill Kong Doumoyuan today, it was still a satisfaction to cripple his cultivation.</p><p>After obtaining the antidote, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong would naturally be proceeding toward Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>However, on their way there, one thing had been bothering Chu Feng the entire time. He was wondering who exactly it was that wanted them dead. Furthermore, that person was a True Immortal on top of that.</p><p>Most importantly, it was very possible for that True Immortal to be an expert from the Upper Realms.</p><p>Chu Feng and Zhao Hong pondered the issue for a long time. However, they were unable to think of an answer.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t feel like he had ever offended any True Immortals apart from the ones from the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>At the moment when Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were racking their brains thinking about who that individual might be, Her Lady Queen suddenly said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, if my guess is correct, that person&#x2026; should be someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eggy, why would you say that?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Although you haven&#x2019;t offended any of the Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortal-level experts, you have killed a person from the Chu Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although the Chu Heavenly Clan has announced that they will not care about the life or death of their younger generations while they&#x2019;re in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, it remains that those younger generations of theirs are people of their Chu Heavenly Clan. As such, how could they really sit and watch, but remain indifferent?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen analyzed.</p><p>&#x201C;Now that you mention it, it is reasonable.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If others were to possess the strength of True Immortal and wanted to take care of me, they could very well attack me head-on. There would be no need for them to help Kong Doumoyuan from the shadows and hide their identity while doing so.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we must provide an explanation for that, then it is true that the Chu Heavenly Clan will be the most suspicious. After all&#x2026; they cannot attack me openly. If they are to do so, they&#x2019;ll have gone against the rules established by their Chu Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, this is no small matter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would be one thing if it were only the people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However, with your current strength, if you are truly targeted by the Chu Heavenly Clan, you cannot be careless anymore.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In short, regardless of who it is that is targeting you from the shadows, you must be careful,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen warned.</p><p>&#x201C;I will be careful,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>After that, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong continued to travel, and finally arrived at Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>Their arrival this time was different from usual. They were not stopped, but were instead directly sent to the Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s side with a teleportation formation right after reaching Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, how was it? Could it be that something has happened?&#x201D;</p><p>Right after seeing the Golden Crane True Immortal, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong became nervous. They faintly felt that something was amiss.</p><p>The reason for that was because they discovered that the Golden Crane True Immortal had a very serious expression on his face.</p><p>Such a serious expression made them afraid that something had happened to Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;There are two matters that I must tell you two about&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, please go ahead,&#x201D; Chu Feng and Zhao Hong said in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;Firstly, I have actually already removed Wang Qiang&#x2019;s poison. I had the two of you search for the antidote merely because I wanted you two to find some answers,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong both fell silent. They had a sensation of being toyed with.</p><p>After all, the two of them had searched for that antidote while placing their lives on the line all so that they could save Wang Qiang. Yet&#x2026; in the end, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s poison was already removed.</p><p>Fortunately, they managed to get through this daunting journey without mishap. Else&#x2026; even Chu Feng was unable to be certain as to whether or not he would hate the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, what about the second matter?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;The second matter is also related to Wang Qiang,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong with Wang Qiang?&#x201D; Chu Feng and Zhao Hong asked in unison. After all, the two of them were the most worried for Wang Qiang&#x2019;s safety.</p><p>&#x201C;There has been a change to Wang Qiang&#x2019;s body. It will be difficult for me to describe.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How about this, the two of you can follow me. Merely, you must be prepared for what you&#x2019;ll see,&#x201D; After he finished those words, the Golden Crane True Immortal waved his sleeve. Then, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong felt the scenery before them changing rapidly.</p><p>The next moment, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong&#x2019;s line of sight returned to normal. They had arrived deep inside a palace.</p><p>&#x201C;That is?!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong&#x2019;s expressions both changed enormously.</p><p>The palace was not very large, nor was it very gorgeous. However, it was very special. Its four walls were all very firm, as very powerful spirit formations had been placed on them.</p><p>Furthermore, the structural composition of the walls were very special too. This most definitely meant that this was a place for one to enter closed-door training.</p><p>Merely, a place for closed-door training should not suffice for Chu Feng and Zhao Hong to react like they did.</p><p>The reason why they were reacting like that was because Wang Qiang was lying here.</p><p>Furthermore, the current Wang Qiang could be said to be entirely different from how he was before.</p><p>An enormous change had occurred to Wang Qiang&#x2019;s body.</p><p>This change was so enormous that even Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were astonished by it.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
