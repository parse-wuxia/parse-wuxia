<p><strong> Chapter 2241 - The Whole Truth Revealed</strong></p><p>&#x201C;For real? He actually refused the Golden Crane True Immortal?&#x201D; The crowd were all astonished upon hearing those words.</p><p>What sort of existence was the Golden Crane True Immortal? Everyone present knew that he was one of the most powerful existences in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Countless people wanted to become his disciple, yet were refused. And now, he wanted to have that Young Master Li Ming as his disciple, but was actually refused. This was truly astonishing.</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, that cannot amount to much. After all, that Young Master Li Ming is truly a demon-level genius. Countless people were refused by him. The Golden Crane True Immortal was only one of them,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said.</p><p>After hearing what Xu Yiyi said, the crowd felt even more astonished. They never expected that there would be such a demon-level genius in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>At the same time, the crowd all wanted to know exactly how powerful that Young Master Li Ming was.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, doesn&#x2019;t this mean that Chu Feng is the second demon-level genius to appear in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Regardless, Chu Feng is our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&#x2019;s second youngest Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said in a very happy manner.</p><p>The crowd nodded at Xu Yiyi&#x2019;s words. They were all expressing their approval.</p><p>At this moment when everyone was joyous, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Jiang Hao had a worried frown. He, who disliked Chu Feng and viewed him as his rival in love, would naturally not wish for Chu Feng to obtain this sort of accomplishment.</p><p>&#x201C;Yiyi, Elder Ning Shuang, I have a matter that I must confess to you all,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what&#x2019;s made you so serious?&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s serious expression, Xu Yiyi was unable to contain herself from smiling.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s concerning Li Rui,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Li Rui?&#x201D; the mention of that name caused the crowd&#x2019;s expression to turn sluggish.</p><p>After all, everyone was able to tell that Li Rui was nowhere to be seen. In fact, they all wanted to know what had happened to Li Rui.</p><p>&#x201C;Now that you mention it, Chu Feng, where&#x2019;s Li Rui?&#x201D; Sure enough, Elder Ning Shuang and the others from the Sunset Cloud Valley questioned Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Li Rui has been killed by me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the expressions of the crowd all changed. This was especially true for the female disciples, who were so scared that their complexions changed color.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you are truly brazen! You actually killed my fellow martial senior!&#x201D; As for Jiang Hao, he directly revealed his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and planned to attack Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; However, before Jiang Hao could attack Chu Feng, Elder Ning Shuang stopped him. Then, he forced a smile and said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you cannot joke about that sort of thing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Ning Shuang, I am not joking. I truly killed Li Rui,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you really killed Li Rui? Exactly what is going on?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi asked.</p><p>At that moment, it was not only Xu Yiyi who had a nervous and confused expression. Many of the people present also revealed confused expressions. They did not understand why Chu Feng would kill Li Rui.</p><p>Furthermore, with Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation and Li Rui&#x2019;s cultivation, it shouldn&#x2019;t be possible for Chu Feng to kill Li Rui.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank four Half Martial Ancestor?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, the crowd noticed that Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation was no longer that of a rank two Half Martial Ancestor, but had instead increased to rank four Half Martial Ancestor.</p><p>Unable to contain herself, Liu Xiaoli asked, &#x201C;Chu Feng, your cultivation?&#x201D; Compared to others, she was even more certain that Chu Feng was clearly only a rank two Half Martial Ancestor before coming here.</p><p>&#x201C;I increased my cultivation after entering Mount Cloud Crane,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Unable to contain himself, Elder Ning Shuang asked, &#x201C;Two successive levels?&#x201D; After all, that was no small matter.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Sssss~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Many of the people present were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air. It was not that they possessed a low endurance toward shock and surprise, but rather increasing two levels of cultivation in succession was truly too astonishing.</p><p>At that moment, the gazes with which the crowd looked to Chu Feng changed again. They seemed to finally understand why Chu Feng possessed his level of cultivation at such a young age.</p><p>Everything was not a coincidence. This child was truly a demon-level character.</p><p>However, at this time when the crowd were exclaiming in admiration at Chu Feng&#x2019;s astonishing talent, there was someone who was unable to sit and continue to watch what was going on. That person was Jiang Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Who cares why he did it? Those that kill another shall pay with their life. Those who owe another shall pay their debt. That is heaven&#x2019;s law and earth&#x2019;s principle. Today, I&#x2026; shall avenge senior brother Li Rui!&#x201D; Jiang Hao shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Jiang Hao raised his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and pointed it at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; Xu Yiyi stepped before Chu Feng, blocking Jiang Hao. She shouted at him, &#x201C;I refuse to believe that Chu Feng would kill senior brother Li Rui!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I can testify that Chu Feng indeed killed Li Rui,&#x201D; Right at that moment, a voice filled with imposing might sounded from Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>When that voice was heard, the crowd were all astonished. They did not expect that the Golden Crane True Immortal would actually come to testify.</p><p>What sort of status did the Golden Crane True Immortal possess? If he were to come out to testify, it would mean that Chu Feng&#x2019;s killing of Li Rui was certainly the truth.</p><p>Out of consideration for their faces, even if Chu Feng was a rare young genius and an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, the Sunset Cloud Valley would definitely not spare Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;This Immortal has seen the course of events personally. It is true that Chu Feng has killed Li Rui. However, it was Li Rui who tried to kill Chu Feng first. Chu Feng was forced to counterattack, and ended up killing Li Rui,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s voice sounded again.</p><p>&#x201C;So it was actually Li Rui who tried to kill Chu Feng first?&#x201D; Hearing those words, many people heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>If Li Rui was truly the one to attack first, it would mean that he was in the wrong. Thus, even if Chu Feng had killed him, it would be reasonable.</p><p>&#x201C;As this matter happened in my Mount Cloud Crane, I will declare that if Chu Feng had killed someone in a completely uncalled-for manner, I would most definitely look into it. However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s killing this time around is justified.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back then, if this Immortal had wanted to prevent Chu Feng from killing Li Rui, I would have been able to do so too. However, this Immortal did not do that. The reason for that is because I felt that Li Rui deserved to die.&#x201D;</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal only said those words, and said no more after that. However, the crowd all understood the Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s intentions.</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal was absolving Chu Feng of responsibility. He had explicitly declared that Chu Feng was not in the wrong to kill Li Rui. If the Sunset Cloud Valley insisted on looking into the matter, it would be possible that the Golden Crane True Immortal would get involved in the matter as well.</p><p>Regardless of how powerful the Sunset Cloud Valley might be, it remained only a tier two power. As such, how could they possibly be a match for the Golden Crane True Immortal?</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, is that really what happened?&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Precisely,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;But, there are neither grievances or grudges between you and Li Rui, why would he try to kill you?&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang was confused.</p><p>&#x201C;It was because of Xu Yiyi,&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to Xu Yiyi.</p><p>&#x201C;Me?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Li Rui liked you. He felt that my existence was a threat to him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, like Jiang Hao, he viewed me as a rival in love.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, different from Jiang Hao, who has openly displayed his hatred toward me, Li Rui had concealed his hatred,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Hearing those words, while the outsiders felt surprised, the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley were not surprised. Evidently, they all knew that Li Rui liked Xu Yiyi.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Ning Shuang, you should remember that I was originally supposed to enter the floating island together with Society President Liu that day. It was Li Rui who insisted on accompanying me instead,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. It was indeed Li Rui who suggested that,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, did you know that those floating islands all possessed a special power left behind by the Exalted that made it impossible to summon one&#x2019;s world spirits there?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Naturally. Not only do I know that, they all knew that too,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang looked to Xu Yiyi and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;I got it,&#x201D; Suddenly, Xu Yiyi seemed to have thought of something. Thus, emotionally, she said, &#x201C;Li Rui deliberately accompanied you to the same floating island because you would not be able to summon your world spirit. He felt that as long as you were unable to summon your world spirit, you would not be a match for him, and he would be able to kill you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Precisely,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Judging from this, it seems that Li Rui had already schemed this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who would&#x2019;ve expected that he was so despicable?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing till this point, many outsiders started to curse at Li Rui. The reason why they were doing that was because they wanted to use this opportunity to get closer to Chu Feng.</p><p>However, no matter what, Li Rui was still a disciple of the Sunset Cloud Valley. Hearing others speaking of Li Rui in such a manner, the expressions of the crowd from the Sunset Cloud Valley turned unsightly.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
