<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1605 - Truly Shameless</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What arrogance! We don&#x2019;t need many people, I, Beitang Yuanliu, am enough to take care of you,&#x201D; A young man stood out from the Beitang Imperial Clan. His age was similar to Chu Feng&#x2019;s. However, his cultivation was a level below Chu Feng&#x2019;s; he was a rank eight Martial King. Yet he did not place Chu Feng in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Heeeh~~~~~&#x201D; Suddenly, that young man shouted. His King-level martial power was emitted outward. His entire person started to shine with golden light. He was planning to attack Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Putt~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, suddenly, his foot slipped. Then, like a dying dog, he fell into the water before the crowd.</p><p>No, he didn&#x2019;t fall. Rather, he was knocked down. Many of the people present had managed to feel an invisible power that landed on that Beitang Yuanliu&#x2019;s body. It was that power that smashed him down.</p><p>At the moment when the crowd were all shocked, Chu Feng calmly said, &#x201C;Next.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, he&#x2019;s the one who did that!!!&#x201D; The crowd were all shocked to hear Chu Feng say that. Immediately, they all managed to react. They had all noticed that the power earlier had indeed originated from Chu Feng. Chu Feng had been the one who defeated Beitang Yuanliu. He actually defeated Beitang Yuanliu with one strike without even moving.</p><p>&#x201C;Trash! Get the hell back!&#x201D; At this moment, Beitang Zimo was extremely enraged, and he started to gnash his teeth in anger. He walked forward and kicked Beitang Yuanliu into the crowd. He had thought that the time to teach Chu Feng a lesson had arrived. Yet, to his surprise, this Beitang Yuanliu had ended up being so useless. Thus, how could Beitang Zimo not be angered?</p><p>&#x201C;All those with rank nine Martial King cultivation, get him. I don&#x2019;t believe that our Beitang Imperial Clan will fear a single Chu Feng!&#x201D; Beitang Zimo shouted loudly.</p><p>Once he said those words, three rank nine Martial Kings walked out from the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s group of people. They were two men and a woman. Each of them possessed an extraordinary aura. The two men all possessed battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Only that woman was slightly weaker, and possessed a battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation.</p><p>However, at this moment, the three Beitang Imperial Clansmen&#x2019;s foreheads all shined brightly with the character &#x2018;Imperial&#x2019;. They had unleashed their Imperial Bloodlines. Their battle power was now extremely strong. On top of that, they were all holding Royal Armaments. Thus, they appeared to be very imposing.</p><p>It would appear that they had learned from the mistake of their predecessor and did not dare to underestimate Chu Feng. Upon their arrival, they immediately revealed all their strength so that they could ruthlessly teach Chu Feng a lesson.</p><p>&#x201C;Earthen Taboo: Beitang Joint Spearhead Slash!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the three Beitang Imperial Clansmen brandished the Royal Armaments in their hands simultaneously. In an instant, heaven and earth started to tremble. Winds began to rise, scudding the clouds away. Not only had the three of them all unleashed an Earthen Taboo martial skill, they had all used a fusion martial skill. With the three of them using it simultaneously, the might of the Earthen Taboo martial skill was increased enormously.</p><p>At this moment, many of the bystanders stepped aside. After all, even though there were a lot of people present, most of them were not even Half Martial Emperors. They deeply feared that the aftermath of this fusion martial skill would injure them.</p><p>Chu Feng was less than a hundred meters away from the three of them. Yet, he stood there without moving. He appeared extremely confident.</p><p>&#x201C;Slash!!!&#x201D; Suddenly, the three Beitang Imperial Clansmen shouted in unison. They had unleashed their attack at Chu Feng. Three slashes that could be seen with the naked eye had fused into one. In an instant, this fused slash arrived before Chu Feng with the intention to hack him in two. They were actually planning to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at the moment when the slash was about to land on Chu Feng, it suddenly started to shine. It was unable to injure Chu Feng and dissipated like a gentle breeze.</p><p>At the same time, the two men&#x2019;s footing slipped like Beitang Yuanliu before them, and they fell into the water with large splashes.</p><p>At that moment, only that woman was still standing there. It was not that Chu Feng could not take care of her. Rather, it was that Chu Feng had decided to act leniently toward her because she was a woman.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D;</p><p>However, this woman clearly did not recognize her situation. Even though Chu Feng had been lenient toward her, not only was she ungrateful, her beautiful figure instantly appeared before Chu Feng. Then, brandishing her short Royal Armament blade in her hand, she sliced it toward Chu Feng&#x2019;s neck with enormous killing intent. She was planning to slice Chu Feng&#x2019;s head apart.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~&#x201D;</p><p>While her strike appeared to be very powerful, Chu Feng managed to catch it with a lift of his hand.</p><p>Chu Feng grabbed that woman&#x2019;s short blade with his hand. After he grabbed it, he clenched his fist, and &#x2018;bang,&#x2019; that woman&#x2019;s short blade shattered into countless fragments.</p><p>&#x201C;Ta, ta, ta~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Putt~~~&#x201D;</p><p>That woman was frightened by Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength. Even though Chu Feng did not attack her, she still moved backwards several steps. In the end, in her panic, she lost control of her ability to remain on the water and fell into the water.</p><p>&#x201C;Trash! You&#x2019;re all trash! All of you, get the hell out of here!&#x201D; At this moment, Beitang Zimo was so enraged that his heart and lungs were about to explode.</p><p>It would be one thing if the people from the Beitang Imperial Clan were to lose after fighting Chu Feng. However, they actually lost instantly without even being able to so much as make him move. This was truly too shameful. His face, the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s face, had all been lost.</p><p>At this moment, he truly felt that he should go ahead and take care of Chu Feng personally. Unfortunately, he could not do so. After all, his cultivation was a lot stronger than Chu Feng&#x2019;s. Even if he were to defeat Chu Feng, others would still declare it to be unfair.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, what you&#x2019;ve done is unfair. You have used world spirit techniques, whereas they have used martial power. Your world spirit techniques are extremely profound. It is only natural that they would not be a match for you. After all, you&#x2019;re a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How about this. I will use world spirit techniques to swap pointers with you, what do you think?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you can defeat me, it would mean that you really do possess outstanding talent.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, another man walked out from the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s group of people. When this man walked out, not to mention Nangong Ya and the others, even the bystanders found it a bit difficult to continue watching.</p><p>This man was at the very least over eighty years old. Strictly speaking, he could be considered to be someone from the younger generation. However, he was, after all, several decades older than Chu Feng. Furthermore, his cultivation was not below Half Martial Emperor. Rather, it was rank three Half Martial Emperor. No matter how one looked at it, this would appear to be bullying. Furthermore, it would be the extremely bullying sort of bullying.</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that the Beitang Clan is unable to take defeat with grace, to actually even dispatch an old fellow who&#x2019;s almost a hundred years old. You&#x2019;ve trained in martial cultivation for several decades more than Chu Feng has. Even if you were to defeat him, would it be glorious?&#x201D; Nangong Ya was truly unable to continue watching anymore, and actually spoke to insult the man.</p><p>&#x201C;My, you shouldn&#x2019;t say it like that. While it is true that my cultivation is stronger than Chu Feng&#x2019;s, I am not yet a hundred years old. According to the life expectancy of the people in the Holy Land of Martialism, I can also be considered to be from the younger generation. Thus, in terms of seniority, I am not bullying Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To fight against Chu Feng as another person from the young generation, exactly how is that inappropriate? His cultivation being inferior to mine is his issue. Moreover, I am not going to use martial power to fight against him. Rather, I will be using the world spirit techniques that he is so proficient in.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, I can sense that his world spirit techniques have reached the Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist level. As for me, I am only an Insect Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Thus, me fighting against him would not be me bullying him. Rather, it would be him bullying me,&#x201D; the man said in a righteous manner.</p><p>&#x201C;You are truly shameless,&#x201D; Seeing that man speaking of such sophistry, Nangong Baihe was so enraged that her little face turned red. She truly wished to teach that man a lesson.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
