<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1393 - Target Of Suppression</strong></p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled indifferently and casually waved his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s casual movement greatly angered that Lin Yezhou. He coldly snorted and then turned to Miao Renlong and clasped his fist to salute.</p><p>He said, &#x201C;Elder Miao, this junior will definitely be able to grasp the formation technique that you&#x2019;ve taught me within a day&#x2019;s time. I will definitely not fail to live up to your expectations. If there is no other matter, junior shall take his leave.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, you may return,&#x201D; Miao Renlong calmly waved his hand to indicate to Lin Yezhou that he could leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior shall take his leave,&#x201D; Lin Yezhou courteously saluted once again. Then, he turned around and left. However, at the moment he turned around, he took a glance at Chu Feng. As for his glance, it was filled with hostility.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Miao, in that case, this junior shall take his leave too,&#x201D; Seeing that, Fu Feitang also asked to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Go ahead, you can return. I believe they will arrive soon . After you&#x2019;ve finished mastering the formation, take a proper rest. Do not put yourselves under too much pressure. Consider it to be just a casual match for swapping pointers,&#x201D; Miao Renlong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior understands,&#x201D; Fu Feiteng saluted once again. However, after he turned around, he did not leave immediately. Instead, he walked over to Chu Feng, patted his shoulder and said with sincerity, &#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, if you have the time, come to my place to drink some wine with me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Most definitely,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied with a smile on his face. Chu Feng was very willing to befriend someone like Fu Feiteng.</p><p>&#x201C;Ying&#x2019;er, you are the one at fault here. You clearly know that Lin Yezhou likes you. Yet you deliberately held onto little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand in front of him. Isn&#x2019;t this a clear provocation?&#x201D; After Fu Feiteng left, Elder Miao gently stroked his beard and spoke with a beaming smile.</p><p>Sima Ying curled her lips and said, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s with that? What does who he likes or doesn&#x2019;t like have to do with me? I merely consider him to be an older brother,&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While you will be fine, but with Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s character, I fear that he will bring trouble upon little friend Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It could be said that you have, unknowingly, created a great enemy for little friend Chu Feng,&#x201D; Miao Renlong said.</p><p>&#x201C;He dares? If he dares to do anything to Chu Feng, then I will not even consider him to be an older brother anymore. I will not let him get away with it,&#x201D; Sima Ying said in a very furious manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, oh you,&#x201D; Faced with such a Sima Ying, Miao Renlong could only laugh helplessly. Then, he said, &#x201C;That said, girl, what has brought you here so urgently? You couldn&#x2019;t possibly have come here just so that you could anger Lin Yezhou, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Miao, that&#x2019;s not it at all. I have come here because I have an urgent matter that I must inform you of,&#x201D; Sima Ying said.</p><p>&#x201C;A girl like you has an urgent matter?&#x201D; Miao Renlong shook his head. He seemed to not believe Sima Ying.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Miao, just listen to me. This time around, I really have an urgent matter,&#x201D; Sima Ying said with certainty.</p><p>Miao Renlong smiled indifferently and ignored her. He walked to a seat, sat down, grabbed the cup of tea and began to slowly drink it. Only after that did he say, &#x201C;Very well, go ahead and tell me about it. I shall see exactly how urgent this matter you speak of really is.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Miao, it&#x2019;s regarding Han Helai,&#x201D; Sima Ying said.</p><p>&#x201C;Han Helai?&#x201D; Hearing the name Han Helai, Miao Renlong was startled. However, he did not give too shocked of a reaction. Instead, he calmly asked, &#x201C;What about him?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We have a way to find out where Han Helai is hiding,&#x201D; Sima Ying said.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Repeat what you just said,&#x201D; Hearing those words, Miao Renlong&#x2019;s expression instantly changed. As he spoke, he stood up. Overcome with emotions, he even crushed the teacup in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Miao, it&#x2019;s like this&#x2026;&#x201D; Sima Ying and Chu Feng began to inform Miao Renlong about all that had happened, skipping no details at all.</p><p>After learning of this matter, Miao Renlong was wild with joy. It could be seen that he also wanted to eliminate that traitor and avenge the people from the World Spiritist Alliance who had died by his hand.</p><p>After that, Miao Renlong gave Sima Ying a title plate. This title plate would allow Sima Ying to enter all of the important locations in the World Spiritist Alliance; it would allow Chu Feng and Sima Ying to search for items that contained Han Helai&#x2019;s aura.</p><p>At the same time, Miao Renlong also began to think of ways to find items that might contain Han Helai&#x2019;s aura.</p><p>However, before they set off to find items that might contain Han Helai&#x2019;s aura, Miao Renlong especially informed Chu Feng and Sima Ying to not inform anyone else about this matter.</p><p>Both Chu Feng and Sima Ying understood Miao Renlong&#x2019;s intentions. After all, it was difficult to fathom a person&#x2019;s mind. They could not be certain that there would not be traitors in the World Spiritist Alliance who would want to collude with Han Helai.</p><p>After their decisions had been made, Chu Feng and Sima Ying moved into action immediately. Originally, they had thought that finding items that contained Han Helai&#x2019;s aura would be a very simple task.</p><p>After all, Han Helai had lived in the World Spiritist Alliance for a very long time. As such, he must have touched a lot of things and left his aura behind on many of them.</p><p>However, when Sima Ying and Chu Feng began their search, they discovered that it was not as easy as they imagined it to be.</p><p>There were some special items in the World Spiritist Alliance that practically everyone had touched before. As such, they contained countless people&#x2019;s auras. Yet, it was only Han Helai&#x2019;s aura that they did not contain.</p><p>Most importantly, Sima Ying was certain that Han Helai had touched those items before.</p><p>Yet, at this time, there was no aura of Han Helai on those items. What did that mean? It meant that while Han Helai had left his aura in those items, his aura had later been eliminated from those items.</p><p>At the beginning, Chu Feng and Sima Ying only guessed that that might be the case. However, as they searched deeper and searched more items throughout the entire World Spiritist Alliance, after two entire days of searching, they were still unable to obtain any harvest. This caused both Chu Feng and Sima Ying to become worried.</p><p>They felt more and more that Han Helai had deliberately eliminated his aura from those items so that others could not find trails of him.</p><p>However, if that really was the case, then even if the person who had stolen the Sealing Glacier was Han Helai, there was nothing that Chu Feng and Sima Ying could do to track him.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, that old animal actually already thought that his aura might be used to track his whereabouts, and had actually completely eliminated his aura from all of the items before he left,&#x201D; At this moment, Sima Ying was so enraged that she began to gnash her teeth. Her anger completely covered her little face.</p><p>She was truly enraged. At the beginning, she had thought that the opportunity to avenge her grandfather and parents was before her. However, who would&#x2019;ve expected that it would all be futile.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be so anxious. He had been in the World Spiritist Alliance for that long and touched that many items. It is impossible for him to have completely eliminated his aura from all of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, hadn&#x2019;t senior Miao gone to search too? The fact that he has gone to search by himself means that he most definitely has his own special method,&#x201D; Chu Feng consoled Sima Ying.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, we can only place our hopes on Grandpa Miao,&#x201D; Sima Ying reluctantly nodded. As they spoke, they were walking toward Miao Renlong&#x2019;s residence. However, the expression of displeasure on Sima Ying&#x2019;s face was not lessened in the slightest.</p><p>Seeing Sima Ying&#x2019;s appearance, Chu Feng did not try to say much and merely silently followed behind her.</p><p>That was because he knew very well that no matter what he said, it would be useless in this sort of situation.</p><p>In fact, how could he not feel depressed too? After all, finding an item that contained Han Helai&#x2019;s aura was also extremely important to him.</p><p>However, at that moment, neither Chu Feng nor Sima Ying knew that at the moment when they were proceeding to find Miao Renlong with their final hope, they had become the hot topic of discussion among the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s younger generation.</p><p>This was especially true for Chu Feng. He had even become the target of suppression for many of the members of the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s younger generation.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
