<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1872 - An Unexpected Conclusion</strong></p><p>At that moment, the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said, &#x201C;Brother Longjian, actually, it is not impossible for us to reconcile. Merely, it will all have to depend on whether little friend Chu Feng is willing to reconcile or not.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, it was also not the desire of our Dongfang Imperial Clan for things to reach this state. If little friend Chu Feng is willing to reconcile, I am willing to personally apologize to little friend Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>When he said those words, the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders had expressions of tacit approval. It was clear that they had already discussed this matter beforehand.</p><p>&#x201C;What? They&#x2019;re really going to reconcile? Furthermore, he said that he&#x2019;ll even apologize?&#x201D; The bystanders were all astonished by what the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Our Beitang Imperial Clan is of the same intention.&#x201D; In the next moment, the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief also voiced that they were willing to reconcile.</p><p>&#x201C;Longjian already represents our Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s intentions,&#x201D; An Utmost Exalted Elder from the Nangong Imperial Clan said. When he said those words, the other Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders and their Clan Chief Nangong Beidou all had expressions of tacit approval.</p><p>As matters stood, they had already realized how powerful Chu Feng was. Else, they would not be this determined to kill him.</p><p>The reason for that was because they knew that if they did not eliminate Chu Feng, they would be eliminated by Chu Feng in the future. However&#x2026; if they were truly able to reconcile with him, if Chu Feng was really willing to reconcile with them, they were extremely willing to do so.</p><p>In fact, the Nangong Imperial Clan, Beitang Imperial Clan and Dongfang Imperial Clan already had the intention to make peace with Chu Feng. Merely, they felt that, with Chu Feng&#x2019;s personality, he would absolutely not reconcile with them. Furthermore, with the way they had treated Chu Feng before, it was simply unrealistic for them to suddenly try to reconcile with him.</p><p>In addition to that, the Ximen Imperial Clan was extremely insistent on killing Chu Feng. As such, none of them mentioned their idea of reconciling with Chu Feng.</p><p>Now that Nangong Longjian was urging for peace, they felt that it was a rare opportunity to reconcile with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you heard what they said, no?&#x201D; Nangong Longjian looked to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;There have never been any grudges or grievances between the Four Great Imperial Clans and me to begin with. The entire time, it has always been the Four Great Imperial Clans that were insistent on killing me. Never have I ever wanted to kill them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If they are willing to reconcile with me, I am naturally also willing to reconcile&#x2026; Merely, people&#x2019;s intentions are unpredictable. After all, they have chased after me with the intention to kill me for so long, I truly fear that they will go back on their word. While they might say that they will reconcile with me, I fear that they will instead thrust their blades into me from behind,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled.</p><p>Chu Feng knew very well what the current situation was. To reconcile would naturally be the best. Furthermore, if Nangong Longjian hadn&#x2019;t shown up, it was very possible that all of them them would have been killed by the Dark Hall. Thus, Nangong Longjian was equivalent to being someone who had saved their lives.</p><p>As a person from the Nangong Imperial Clan, Nangong Longjian had actually suppressed the Four Great Imperial Clans and forcibly demanded that they make peace with Chu Feng. If Chu Feng were to refuse to make peace now, he would truly be one who was ignorant of the situation. Thus&#x2026; he must give Nangong Longjian face.</p><p>Furthermore, if Chu Feng was really able to reconcile with the Four Great Imperial Clans, there would only be hundreds of benefits without any harm.</p><p>Firstly, Chu Feng still possessed a weak level of cultivation, and he was no match for the Four Great Imperial Clans by himself. Next, even if he was able to emerge in power, he would still not eliminate the Four Great Imperial Clans. At the very most, he would kill those who had tried to kill him.</p><p>Chu Feng was no longer the hot-blooded youth that he was previously. He was a lot more mature now. He knew that regardless of how enormous the hatred he bore might be, one should still not kill the innocent. Although the Four Great Imperial Clans were extremely vile, there were definitely good people among them.</p><p>For example, there were Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli. They were all Chu Feng&#x2019;s friends. Regardless of how enormous the hatred between Chu Feng and their Nangong Imperial Clan might be, Chu Feng would not go and kill them. As such, how could Chu Feng possibly have the heart to exterminate his friends&#x2019; clan and make them destitute and homeless?</p><p>Merely, Chu Feng did not trust the Four Great Imperial Clans. That was why he wanted Nangong Longjian to provide him with a guarantee.</p><p>&#x201C;Regarding that, you can rest assured. If they dare to go back on their word, regardless of which clan they might be, I will exterminate them for you,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ssss~~~&#x201D; Hearing those words, the crowd all sucked in a mouthful of cold air. As someone from the Four Great Imperial Clans, Nangong Longjian actually said such a thing. He was truly unconventional and different from the masses.</p><p>However, at that moment, other than the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans, no one else felt Nangong Longjian&#x2019;s behavior to be unfilial. Instead, they felt that he was a real man, capable of distinguishing right from wrong.</p><p>Furthermore, after hearing this much, the crowd was able to tell that the Four Great Imperial Clans were actually the only ones in the wrong. As for the crimes the Four Great Imperial Clans had accused Chu Feng of committing, and how they had accused Chu Feng of being an ingrate, it was evidently all fake.</p><p>&#x201C;But, if I am to be killed, I&#x2019;m afraid that&#x2026; even you will not know which Imperial Clan killed me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;If you are to be killed, I will investigate the matter. If it is truly related to the Four Great Imperial Clans, I will make the Four Great Imperial Clans accompany you in death,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Since senior has already said it to such a degree, then Chu Feng is willing to reconcile. Merely&#x2026; I wonder what the intention of the Ximen Imperial Clan might be?&#x201D; After Chu Feng said those words, he turned his gaze to Ximen Baiyuan.</p><p>&#x201C;Ximen Imperial Clan, do you wish to live or die?&#x201D; After Nangong Longjian said those words, he pointed his Heavenly Dragon Golden Sword at Ximen Baiyuan.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The enormous golden dragon that sealed off the heavens let its dragon&#x2019;s might descend and cover all of the people from the Ximen Imperial Clan. The more powerful one was, the more pressure they felt. Many Martial Emperor-level experts were incapable of resisting the dragon&#x2019;s might and started to kneel one after another. At that moment&#x2026; of the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Martial Emperors, only Ximen Baiyuan still strenuously stood. Merely, even though he was barely standing, he was trembling nonstop.</p><p>In fact, it was not that Ximen Baiyuan had managed to withstand the dragon&#x2019;s might because he was powerful. Rather, Nangong Longjian felt that as Ximen Baiyuan was the strongest individual in the Ximen Imperial Clan, he should leave him some face. Else, if Nangong Longjian had wanted Ximen Baiyuan to kneel to him, he too would have had to kneel to him.</p><p>&#x201C;Sigh~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is the will of the heavens.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, it&#x2019;s a pity for my grandson Feixue. Originally, he possessed grand prospects. Yet, just like that, his future was ruined.&#x201D;</p><p>Ximen Baiyuan closed his eyes. He faced the sky and sighed a long sigh. Two streams of hot tears rolled down from the corners of his aged eyes. From his words, one could tell that the reason why the Ximen Imperial Clan insisted on killing Chu Feng, the reason why they hated Chu Feng this enormously, was actually all because Chu Feng had ruined Ximen Feixue&#x2019;s reputation as a genius.</p><p>After that sigh, Ximen Baiyuan waved his hand at the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders. He said, &#x201C;Forget about it, forget about it. Just reconcile. If we are to continue fighting, it will ultimately be detrimental to our Ximen Imperial Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, even though the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders were extremely unwilling to reconcile with Chu Feng, they did not say anything.</p><p>However, while the upper echelons of the Ximen Imperial Clan were unwilling to reconcile, from the expressions of the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s clansmen, it could be seen that they were actually wishing to be able to reconcile with Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s speed of growth was extremely frightening. His speed of growth had caused them to tremble with fear. Over the course of these days when they had made an enemy out of Chu Feng, the name Chu Feng had been like a nightmare to them.</p><p>In fact, many of them had the same sort of nightmare. They dreamed that one day, Chu Feng would come and massacre their entire Ximen Imperial Clan by himself.</p><p>And now&#x2026; as long as they were able to reconcile with Chu Feng, they would be able to break free from that nightmare.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. Today, I, Nangong Longjian, shall bear witness to this. The grudges and grievances between Chu Feng and the Four Great Imperial Clans shall be written off with one stroke. From today on, both parties will become friends.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If any party is to go against the agreement today, I, Nangong Longjian, will eliminate their entire clan,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian raised his sword and shouted loudly. His words were like thunder. No one doubted what he said. The reason for that was because Nangong Longjian was definitely someone who would do what he said.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
