<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1829 - Heaven Taboo Martial Skill</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng continued to attack. His attacks were extremely extravagant and incomparably ferocious. It was as if ten thousand meteorites were falling at once as his attacks continued to land on the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor.</p><p>A moment of carelessness from the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor allowed Chu Feng&#x2019;s fist to break through his defense and land on his left rib.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Another loud explosion sounded. The War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor was knocked several thousand meters away before firmly crashing into the cave&#x2019;s wall.</p><p>The cave&#x2019;s wall was completely undamaged. However, his body was emitting cracking noises. With merely a single fist strike, Chu Feng had broken three of the ribs on his left side.</p><p>&#x201C;With merely this amount of ability, you actually dared to proclaim yourself to be an elite of the King Monstrous Dragon Race?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a disdainful smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D; The War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor was extremely enraged. He took out an enormous meteor hammer and smashed it at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Huu, huu, huu, huu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>As the meteor hammer was being spun around, whistling sound of winds started to echo. Wherever it passed, it would leave an area of pitch-blackness. Even space itself was destroyed by it. It turned out that that meteor hammer was an Incomplete Imperial Armament.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that you still won&#x2019;t do even if we are to compare weapons,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the Heavenly Immortal Sword and held it in his hand. Then, he began to unleash his sharp sword techniques like a torrential storm of pear blossoms. Not only did he block that War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor&#x2019;s meteor hammer, he was also unleashing counterattacks at that Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it,&#x201D; Being suppressed repeatedly, that War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor started to gnash his teeth with bulging veins in anger.</p><p>No matter what, he was an actual rank two Martial Emperor. When using an Incomplete Imperial Armament, he was capable of unleashing its true might. As for that meteor hammer, it had accompanied him for many years. Fundamentally, he had reached a point of fusion with his weapon. Many Martial Emperors at his same cultivation had been defeated by that meteor hammer.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, while his cultivation was also that of a Martial Emperor right now, he had only obtained it through using a special method to increase his cultivation. He refused to acknowledge Chu Feng&#x2019;s current cultivation as being real.</p><p>To him, Chu Feng was a fake Martial Emperor. Yet, this fake Martial Emperor had not only managed to suppress him in terms of fighting with fists and feet, he had actually also surpassed him when using Incomplete Imperial Armaments. As such, how could he possibly tolerate this?</p><p>However, the thing that made him feel the most helpless was that even though he was unable to tolerate being suppressed, there was nothing that he could do about it, as he was no match for Chu Feng. This was the truth that he could not change.</p><p>&#x201C;Your hammer&#x2019;s quite good. Unfortunately, you are unable to master it. Your usage of it is truly bad. It is simply a waste of a good weapon,&#x201D; While Chu Feng was suppressing that War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor, he also spoke words to mock him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;re truly excessive!&#x201D; The War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor was so enraged by Chu Feng that he felt as if his heart, liver, spleen and lungs were all about to explode. In anger, he suddenly shouted, and then a boundless power began to emit from within him.</p><p>Being forced into a corner, he had decided to strike back and not hide and dodge anymore. He had decided to meet force with force.</p><p>The powerful strength of the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor did not come out of nowhere. Many fiery red veined patterns appeared on his body.</p><p>Those veined patterns were like magma. It was extremely blazing and dazzling to the eyes. Chu Feng noticed that blood was coming out of the fiery red veined patterns. Yes, that was actual blood.</p><p>&#x201C;A self mutilation technique?&#x201D; Chu Feng had discovered the secret to the increase of the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor&#x2019;s strength.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, this is bad! He&#x2019;s burning his bloodline! He is planning to use his own life to exchange for your life!&#x201D; Yaojiao Tingyu shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;Burning his bloodline? He is able to become more powerful after burning his bloodline?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. He is burning an extremely high degree of his bloodline right now. After this attack of his, he will explode and he will definitely die. However, in exchange for that, he has obtained enormously powerful strength. His strength is now infinitely close to that of a rank three Martial Emperor,&#x201D; Yaojiao Tingyu said.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, I&#x2019;ll give him a chance,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he actually moved to the side, and no longer continued to attack the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you doing? Quickly, stop him!&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng was no longer beating down on the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor and had instead moved to the side, both Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor were extremely frightened.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not do as they said. Instead, he looked to the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor and said, &#x201C;Go and accumulate your strength. After you&#x2019;re done, come and fight me again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; The War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor snorted coldly. He was being looked down upon. Chu Feng&#x2019;s action was most definitely looking down on him.</p><p>Even though he was extremely furious, he had to accept being looked down on. It was true, it required some time for him to unleash his next attack. If Chu Feng were to disturb him, he might not be able to unleash it. However, if Chu Feng were to look on without lifting a finger, he would definitely be able to unleash it.</p><p>Upon thinking of how Chu Feng would be met with a miserable death because of his arrogance and conceit, the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor felt that even if he were to suffer even more humiliation, it would all be worth it.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble, rumble, rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor spread open his arms. Then, a fiery gaseous substance began to flow out from the fiery cracks all over his body.</p><p>The speed of the fiery gaseous substance was extremely fast. In an instant, it formed a several hundred-meter-long enormous fiery monstrous dragon.</p><p>Although the monstrous dragon was formed with gaseous substance and semitransparent, it possessed a ferocious appearance, and was even more domineering than ordinary King Monstrous Dragon Beasts.</p><p>Most importantly, it contained an extremely powerful strength capable of destroying heaven and earth.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a muffled explosion was heard. That War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor had exploded. However, after he exploded, his aura was still present. He was not dead. Instead, he had fused with that fiery red gaseous substance.</p><p>At this moment, he was that gaseous substance, and that gaseous substance was him. Furthermore, he was getting even bigger.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, he actually mastered that technique,&#x201D; Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor both had dejected expressions on their faces.</p><p>The two of them both knew how frightening this move was. It was a taboo technique by the name of &#x2018;Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon.&#x2019; This technique could only be unleashed by burning a King Monstrous Dragon Beast&#x2019;s bloodline.</p><p>Burning one&#x2019;s bloodline was equivalent to committing suicide. Thus, if any King Monstrous Dragon Beast was able to successfully unleash this technique, they would soon die.</p><p>However, without a doubt, the Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon was extremely powerful. It was a technique comparable to that of a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, it seems that you all will not be able to recognize me anymore. However, it&#x2019;s too late now. I have successfully unleashed this technique. All that you all can do now is wait for your deaths,&#x201D; Seeing the dejected expressions on Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor&#x2019;s faces, the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor revealed a smile that had not been seen for a long time. Merely, his smile was currently being shown on the fiery red gaseous monstrous dragon. Looking at it, he appeared to be extremely sinister-looking.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you will soon pay for your arrogance. I shall let you experience the might of a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill now,&#x201D; The War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor turned his fierce gaze onto Chu Feng. At this moment, he had already turned into the Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon and obtained the strength to suppress Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;And here I was thinking about what sort of exceptionally amazing technique you would unleash with the price of your death. It turns out, after all this, it&#x2019;s only at this level. Heaven Taboo Martial Skill? Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng revealed a mocking smile.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you laughing about?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng was still looking down on him even after he had turned into his current form, the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor became extremely angry.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes suddenly flashed with sharpness. Immediately afterwards, his black hair started to drift, and his gown started to flutter violently as a crimson gaseous substance was emitted from his body.</p><p>When the crimson gaseous substance appeared, it moved about extremely quickly. In no time, it covered this entire region. Not to mention Chu Feng, Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor, even the huge monster that the War Faction&#x2019;s Martial Emperor had turned into, that Bloodline King Monstrous Dragon, was also covered by the crimson gaseous substance.</p><p>At that moment, an extremely horrifying sound began to be heard from within the crimson gaseous substance.</p><p>No one could describe what sort of sound it was. It was as if that sound simply did not belong to this world.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
