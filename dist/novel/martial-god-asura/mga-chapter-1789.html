<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1789 - Rank One Martial Emperor</strong></p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s settled then?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Definitely!&#x201D; Leng Yue said.</p><p>&#x201C;What if you go back on your word?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;If I, Leng Yue, am to go back on my word, I will be inferior to pigs and dogs. I will not be qualified to be the head of the Heavenly Law Palace&#x2019;s Heavenly Generals. After this life of mine, I shall be reincarnated as animals that will be slaughtered and trampled upon by others for eternity,&#x201D; Leng Yue raised her arm and vowed.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, quite ruthless. Since that&#x2019;s the case, I&#x2019;ll reluctantly trust you this once,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, you can attack. I&#x2019;d suggest that you go all out. Else, it will be boring.&#x201D;</p><p>After Leng Yue said those words, she actually closed her eyes. She did not even bother to look at Chu Feng. Her intention was extremely clear. Even though she wanted to fight against Chu Feng, she did not place Chu Feng in her eyes at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Arrogant enough. However, Leng Yue possesses the means to be this arrogant,&#x201D; Seeing Leng Yue acting like this, Baili Xinghe smiled complacently. As he looked to Chu Feng, he thought in his heart, &#x2018;Chu Feng, I shall see how you&#x2019;ll be humiliated.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;There is no need for me to personally fight against you,&#x201D; However, facing Leng Yue&#x2019;s provocation, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, with a thought, a wave of water flowed out from within his body. The Water Immortal Profound Technique appeared before him.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right after the Water Immortal Profound Technique appeared, it immediately began to attack Leng Yue. Tens of thousands of water droplets turned into sharp arrows as they splashed at Leng Yue like a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses.</p><p>Most importantly, while Chu Feng&#x2019;s current cultivation was that of a rank seven Half Martial Emperor, the Water Immortal Profound Technique was actually a rank eight Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Water Immortal Profound Technique. That guy really does possess a supreme secret skill,&#x201D; At this moment, Leng Yue suddenly opened her eyes and revealed an expression of shock.</p><p>As a disciple of the Heavenly Law Palace, she had been fortunate enough to see her Heavenly Law Palace&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder revealing the might of the Wood Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>At that time, when she saw that vivid and life-like Wood Immortal Profound Technique that possessed a cultivation one level higher than even its user, Leng Yue felt endless admiration, and vowed that she would definitely obtain that Wood Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>And now, the Water Immortal Profound Technique that was equally as famous as the Wood Immortal Profound Technique was right before her. Furthermore, it was attacking her.</p><p>Even more, the possessor of this Water Immortal Profound Technique was actually a fellow member of the younger generation. This caused her to feel extremely unreconciled.</p><p>&#x201C;A mere rank eight Half Martial Emperor will not be a match for me,&#x201D; Leng Yue shouted. Then, like a willow leaf, her body shifted. As she began to move, not only did she dodge all of the Water Immortal Profound Technique&#x2019;s attacks, she had also arrived before the Water Immortal Profound Technique in an instant.</p><p>&#x201C;Pa, pa, pa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After approaching it, coldness flashed through Leng Yue&#x2019;s eyes. Her lily-white hands shot multiple strikes at the Water Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Her speed was extremely fast. Even though her hands were very tender and soft, each of her palm strikes created a splash on the body of the Water Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>In merely an instant, the Water Immortal Profound Technique had been utterly smashed to bits by Leng Yue.</p><p>&#x201C;Sure enough, it&#x2019;s as I anticipated,&#x201D; Although the Water Immortal Profound Technique was defeated, Chu Feng was smiling lightly. Leng Yue was this powerful because she possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p><p>Thus, even though they were at the same level of cultivation, the Water Immortal Profound Technique, which only possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, was simply no match for Leng Yue.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng was not worried, and instead felt joyous, was because he had guessed correctly.</p><p>This Leng Yue was simply not someone that Zhang Tianyi could defeat. Thus&#x2026; his decision to come and fight Leng Yue was correct.</p><p>&#x201C;A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, that Leng Yue also possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.&#x201D; Although Chu Feng had anticipated this, Baili Xinghe was extremely shocked. Evidently, he had not expected Leng Yue to be this powerful, more powerful than he had anticipated.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;re truly unlucky,&#x201D; However, after a moment of surprise, Baili Xinghe suddenly looked to Chu Feng. The smile on his face grew even denser.</p><p>&#x201C;Crash~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, with another attack, the Water Immortal Profound Technique had been completely destroyed by Leng Yue. However, as the Water Immortal Profound Technique turned into waves of water, the water began to surge. Then, the Water Immortal Profound Technique returned to its original appearance. Without the slightest damage, the Water Immortal Profound Technique began to unleash attacks at Leng Yue again.</p><p>However, Leng Yue&#x2019;s battle power was an entire level above the Water Profound Immortal Technique&#x2019;s. No matter how ferocious the Water Profound Immortal Technique might be, it was incapable of injuring Leng Yue in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;As long as its master is alive, the secret skill will be indestructible. The Water Immortal Profound Technique is truly miraculous.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it is your fortune to have been able to obtain the Water Immortal Profound Technique. However, for this Water Immortal Profound Technique to serve you, is its misfortune,&#x201D; Leng Yue said mockingly. From her every word and every action, it could be seen that she deeply wanted to obtain the Water Profound Immortal Technique.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you certain?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled coldly. Then, lightning flashed in his eyes, and his Thunder Armor appeared.</p><p>When his cultivation increased to rank eight Half Martial Emperor, the Water Immortal Profound Technique&#x2019;s cultivation increased to rank nine Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; Seeing that the Water Immortal Profound Technique was now capable of fighting on par with her, Leng Yue did not dare to be careless anymore. She had started to become serious.</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible!&#x201D; At this moment, Baili Xinghe was enormously shocked. The entire time, he had thought that Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation of rank seven Half Martial Emperor had been obtained by using the power of his lightnings.</p><p>It was only now that he came to discover that he had been mistaken. Chu Feng had not relied on the power of his lightnings to obtain his cultivation of rank seven Half Martial Emperor. Instead, it was his actual cultivation. His actual cultivation was that of a rank seven Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>However, when he thought of how Chu Feng had only been a mere Martial King when he had first met him, but was already a rank seven Half Martial Emperor now, and was capable of obtaining a cultivation above his own, Baili Xinghe started to involuntarily tremble with fear.</p><p>Unreconciliation. Jealousy. However, more than all of those, he was feeling fear.</p><p>To be able to reach rank seven Half Martial Emperor from rank nine Martial King in such a short period of time, how enormous of an amount of talent did he possess? His talent most definitely surpassed that of ordinary people. It could be said that he could not be considered to be human at all!</p><p>Such an existence was actually a fellow member of the younger generation like himself? Baili Xinghe felt that Chu Feng&#x2019;s existence was a great calamity to both him and all the rest of the younger generation.</p><p>&#x201C;Leng Yue, you must definitely kill that Chu Feng. Else, he will assuredly become an enormous disaster,&#x201D; After his moment of shock and fear, Baili Xinghe cast all of his hope onto Leng Yue.</p><p>He wished for Chu Feng&#x2019;s death. He wished that Chu Feng would be killed today. The reason for that was because he knew that he was already no match for Chu Feng. Yet, he had spoken those threatening words to Chu Feng earlier. Today, if Chu Feng wasn&#x2019;t killed, he, Baili Xinghe, would be killed instead.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I know that your lightning power is capable of increasing your cultivation by another level. Why not directly use it? Else, if this is all the strength you&#x2019;re showing, I&#x2019;m afraid that even the Water Immortal Profound Technique will not be able to help you.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Leng Yue shouted. Then, gales began to appear within her ice-cold gaze. At the same time, heaven and earth became dark, and violent wind sprung forth everywhere. Leng Yue&#x2019;s cultivation had increased from rank eight Half Martial Emperor to rank nine Half Martial Emperor. She was only a fine line away from becoming a Martial Emperor.</p><p>This was Divine Power. Leng Yue was a Divine Body.</p><p>&#x201C;As you wish.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Leng Yue had increased her cultivation, Chu Feng did not hesitate. Lightning flashed through his eyes again as two magnificent Thunder Wings began to spread from his back.</p><p>When Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation increased from rank eight Half Martial Emperor to rank nine Half Martial Emperor, the Water Immortal Profound Technique&#x2019;s cultivation also increased from rank nine Half Martial Emperor to rank one Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Although there was only a fine distinction between Half Martial Emperors and Martial Emperors, what Half Martial Emperors possessed was impure Emperor-level martial power, whereas the one possessed by Martial Emperors was real Emperor-level martial power.</p><p>Although the Water Immortal Profound Technique no longer possessed its own intelligence anymore, its cultivation was that of an actual rank one Martial Emperor.</p><p>In this regard, the Water Immortal Profound Technique&#x2019;s strength was many times more powerful. As water surged forth, even space itself was shattered. Wherever the water passed, a pitch-black void would be left behind.</p><p>The might of the Water Immortal Profound Technique could only be described with one word, &#x2018;frightening.&#x2019;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
