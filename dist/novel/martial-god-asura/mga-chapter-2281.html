<p><strong> Chapter 2281 - Contrary To Expectation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Ah?&#x201D; After hearing what Su Jingrui said, Xu Yiyi&#x2019;s already worried face was filled with even more nervousness.</p><p>In fact, it was not only Xu Yiyi who was worried. The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master, Su Jingrui, and even the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster, who did not possess much of a relationship with Chu Feng, were deeply worried for him.</p><p>Very few people would want a talented genius like Chu Feng to die like so, so easily.</p><p>&#x201C;Continue to run. I shall see how much longer you can run. Today, you will undoubtedly be killed,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star grew more and more complacent.</p><p>&#x201C;Undoubtedly be killed? That&#x2019;s not for certain,&#x201D; Although Chu Feng appeared to be in a very sorry state as he was escaping the entire time, he did not appear to have the attitude of admitting defeat.</p><p>&#x201C;You are truly one who is reluctant to admit your defeat. Do you know the origins of my spirit formation?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This spirit formation of mine was obtained from a remnant of Grandmaster Kai Hong. It is a spirit formation left behind by Grandmaster Kai Hong!&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star said proudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandmaster Kai Hong? That is actually a spirit formation created by Grandmaster Kai Hong?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder, no wonder&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, the expressions of the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others all changed enormously.</p><p>While Chu Feng did not know who Grandmaster Kai Hong was, they did.</p><p>Grandmaster Kai Hong was someone who had died tens of thousands of years ago. However, his legend still circulated throughout the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm even now.</p><p>Grandmaster Kai Hong was a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. He was a legend in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>In fact, Grandmaster Kai Hong was deemed to be one of the most powerful world spiritists in the history of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>For the spirit formation Daoist Gold Star had unleashed to actually be something created by Grandmaster Kai Hong, it was no wonder that the spirit formation would be so powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;This spirit formation of mine is capable of absorbing all spirit power. It is simply impossible for Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists to break through my spirit formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, my spirit formation is extremely mighty. Unless you are to use martial power, it is impossible for you to withstand my spirit formation&#x2019;s attack.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, no matter how much spirit power you might possess, sooner or later, you will exhaust it. However, my spirit formation will not stop, nor will it perish until it manages to strike you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, today, you will undoubtedly be killed,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star said those words with absolute confidence. It was as if he had truly grasped victory in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not for certain,&#x201D; However, right at that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s figure suddenly shifted. He began to fly toward Daoist Gold Star.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Are you going to walk right into my attack?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Or could it be that you are trying to achieve mutual destruction?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. I am truly sorry to inform you of this, but you will not be able to cause me harm. You, on the other hand, will be killed by me.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng was flying rapidly towards him, Daoist Gold Star was not afraid. He waved his sleeve, and a layer of spirit power appeared. Soon, his spirit power formed a fort that completely protected him within it.</p><p>Following that, one of his hands began to change nonstop as he formed hand seals in succession. He was making the defenses of his fort stronger and stronger.</p><p>Seeing that spirit formation fort, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others were completely discouraged.</p><p>Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s current spirit formation fort was even stronger than what he had unleashed to block Chu Feng&#x2019;s previous attack. Unless Chu Feng was capable of setting up an even more powerful spirit formation, it would simply be impossible for Chu Feng to break through that spirit formation fort.</p><p>If Chu Feng was unable to break through that spirit formation fort and was stopped by it, it would mean that the spirit formation sphere that was chasing after him the entire time would finally be able to strike him.</p><p>&#x201C;I cannot let little friend Chu Feng die like this. I must stop him.&#x201D;</p><p>Thinking of this, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master quietly moved his body toward Chu Feng and Daoist Gold Star.</p><p>At the same time, surging martial power began to gather in his palm. He was planning to save Chu Feng.</p><p>In fact, it was not only the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master. Su Jingrui was also doing the same sort of thing as him. He too was preparing to save Chu Feng in this moment of imminent peril.</p><p>At the very least, the two of them wanted to preserve Chu Feng&#x2019;s life.</p><p>However, right at the moment when everyone felt that Chu Feng would undoubtedly be defeated, Chu Feng&#x2019;s lips were raised into an upward curve.</p><p>&#x201C;Puu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng opened his mouth. Then, a walnut-sized sphere of light shot out of his mouth and flew rapidly toward the fort.</p><p>Everything happened too quickly. By the time the crowd noticed what had happened, the sphere of light Chu Feng shot out of his mouth had already landed on Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s defensive fort.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Rumbles sounded nonstop as energy ripples swept forth. That sphere of light actually managed to shatter Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s defensive fort instantly.</p><p>&#x201C;That is a spirit formation?!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others were all greatly alarmed. The reason for that was because they were able to tell that the sphere of light Chu Feng had spit out was no ordinary spirit formation. Instead, it was a sort of very powerful slaughtering formation.</p><p>Else, it would be impossible for him to be able to break through Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s defensive formation that easily.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it! I&#x2019;ve been made a fool of!&#x201D;</p><p>Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s expression also changed enormously. The reason for that was because the sphere of light Chu Feng had spit out was already extremely close to him. It was impossible for him to dodge the sphere.</p><p>Unable to dodge, he could only wait for the sphere of light to strike his body like a shooting target.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, that sphere of light landed onto Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s chest. However, to the crowd&#x2019;s surprise, that sphere of light did not let out the expected explosion or ferocious energy ripples. Instead, it landed onto Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s body like a feather.</p><p>&#x201C;Truly despicable.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others all started to gnash their teeth angrily.</p><p>The reason for that was because a layer of spirit formation armor had appeared around Daoist Gold Star. That armor contained a special sort of power. It was that armor that had managed to block the sphere of light Chu Feng had spit out.</p><p>However, that spirit formation armor was not a spirit formation that Daoist Gold Star had set up. Rather, it seemed to be a protective treasure that would automatically activate to save its master&#x2019;s life during crucial moments.</p><p>That sort of behavior was simply akin to cheating. However, due to the fact that even though that spirit formation armor was created by a treasure, it only emitted spirit power, it could not be said that Daoist Gold Star was cheating.</p><p>That was the reason why the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others felt Daoist Gold Star to be despicable.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve lost.&#x201D;</p><p>Daoist Gold Star was smiling so strongly that his face became filled with wrinkles like a steamed bun. He was truly overjoyed.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was less than a meter away from his spirit formation sphere. It would simply be impossible for Chu Feng to escape from it now.</p><p>&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s smile remained unchanged after hearing what Daoist Gold Star said.</p><p>Seeing that smile, the crowd&#x2019;s hearts all tensed up. They were all unable to make head or tails of it.</p><p>Even though a calamity loomed, how could Chu Feng still smile so easily?</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when the crowd was puzzled, the spirit formation sphere that had been chasing after Chu Feng the entire time, that spirit formation created by the legendary Grandmaster Kai Hong, actually brushed past Chu Feng&#x2019;s side.</p><p>The spirit formation sphere did not strike Chu Feng. Instead, it turned into a ray of light that carried frightening might with it as it began to fly toward Daoist Gold Star.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The sphere struck Daoist Gold Star. Immediately, a loud explosion was heard.</p><p>Surging energy ripples completely engulfed Daoist Gold Star.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, not only were the people of the younger generation like Xu Yiyi stunned, even the grand characters like the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master were stunned.</p><p>That was clearly Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s spirit formation. Why would it strike Daoist Gold Star instead?</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
