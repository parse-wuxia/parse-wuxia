<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1650 - Revealing One&#x2019;s Strength</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Bastard, you actually dare to think about my second brother&#x2019;s Cyan Rainbow Sword? I will properly teach you a lesson, you arrogant trash.&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s perception was very keen. He actually discovered that Chu Feng was thinking about obtaining the Cyan Rainbow Sword for himself. This immediately enraged him. In a violent rage, he immediately attacked Chu Feng. His two palms shot forward with lightning speed. Each palm strike created wind. He was planning to completely tear Chu Feng to pieces.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>However, Chu Feng only chuckled at Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s attack. His footsteps changed, and his body moved slightly. Like a phantom, he disappeared. His speed was so fast that one simply could not see how he managed to accomplish it.</p><p>&#x201C;This guy,&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng disappear before his eyes, Nangong Tianshi was startled. Evidently, he did not expect that Chu Feng would have a speed this fast.</p><p>&#x201C;If you want to teach me a lesson, you must first possess the strength to do so,&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s voice sounded. Nangong Tianshi immediately turned around and discovered that Chu Feng was standing behind him. He was looking at him with a gaze of contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D; At this moment, Nangong Tianshi was so enraged that his martial power began to surge forth explosively. Like an inescapable net, it covered the sky above and the earth below. He was trying to seal Chu Feng off with his omnipresent power.</p><p>This was a martial skill, a rank nine martial skill. However, when it was being used by Nangong Tianshi, this rank nine martial skill&#x2019;s might was extremely strong.</p><p>Not only was it strong, it was dreadfully strong. This rank nine martial skill simply seemed to possess the power to bring about destruction to the world.</p><p>As Chu Feng saw this attack that sealed off both heaven and earth coming toward him, even Chu Feng began to feel admiration for Nangong Tianshi.</p><p>Nangong Tianshi was truly worthy of being a prince of the Nangong Imperial Clan. He truly possessed very remarkable strength, and he could be considered to be someone capable of fighting against Chu Feng.</p><p>Thus, when facing Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s attack, Chu Feng did not plan to hold back. With a flip of his palm, he took out his Infinity Edge. He was planning to meet Nangong Tianshi head on.</p><p>Chu Feng immediately attacked. His foot began to step forward. His speed was many times faster than lightning. He charged toward Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s golden-bright and dazzling net of martial power.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng slashed downward. Then, a slash appeared in the sky. As the golden light shone in the sky, as the energy ripples wreaked havoc, he sliced apart Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s inescapable net.</p><p>After the first successful attack, Chu Feng attacked again. The Infinity Edge in his hand turned into many blurs as it was waved toward Nangong Tianshi.</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Tianshi discovered that the situation was bad. He immediately flipped his palm and took out a large golden-bright and dazzling hammer.</p><p>This large hammer was the same as Chu Feng&#x2019;s Infinity Edge; it was an Incomplete Imperial Armament copy. As the hammer waved up and down, it actually managed to block Chu Feng&#x2019;s numerous attacks.</p><p>As he had also taken out an Incomplete Imperial Armament copy, Nangong Tianshi became equally matched against Chu Feng. After he blocked Chu Feng&#x2019;s attacks, he immediately unleashed counterattacks at Chu Feng.</p><p>However&#x2026; right at this moment, he was shocked to find out that he was only equally matched against Chu Feng.</p><p>He was clearly a rank four Half Martial Emperor. Furthermore, he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Even if Chu Feng had increased his cultivation to that of a rank three Half martial Emperor, he shouldn&#x2019;t possess the ability to contend against him.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had managed to do so. Not only was he able to contend against him, Chu Feng even seemed to be able to obtain the upper hand in their battle.</p><p>This not only shocked Nangong Tianshi, this was also something that he found very difficult to accept. One must know that he had already activated his Imperial Bloodline at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible! This is impossible! How could you possibly have a battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?!&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Tianshi had an expression of disbelief on his face. Evidently, he had come to realize that it was definitely not a coincidence that Chu Feng was able to fight against him. Instead, it was because Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p><p>&#x201C;A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?&#x201D; After hearing what Nangong Tianshi said, Nangong Tianhu started to frown deeply, and he began to carefully observe the battle between Chu Feng and Nangong Tianshi. After observing their battle, his expression immediately changed. Evidently, he had also discovered that Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p><p>As Nangong Tianhu spared no effort in suppressing the Water Immortal Profound Technique, he shouted to Nangong Tianshi, &#x201C;Third brother, we absolutely cannot let him live! Else, he will definitely become a problem in the future! Use your full strength, kill him!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I understand,&#x201D; As Nangong Tianshi spoke, his body moved backward explosively. Following that, he put away his large golden hammer away.</p><p>Chu Feng did not chase after Nangong Tianshi. He was very confused by Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s actions. He wondered what exactly Nangong Tianshi had under his sleeve. When Chu Feng saw Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s next actions, he finally came to a realization.</p><p>Right at this moment, Nangong Tianshi flipped his palm and took out another weapon.</p><p>It was a purple sword. Not only did it have the same appearance as Nangong Tianhu&#x2019;s Cyan Rainbow Sword, even the might it emitted was exactly the same. Evidently, this was another Incomplete Imperial Armament.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, the Nangong Imperial Clan is truly wealthy. The two of you actually both possess Incomplete Imperial Armaments. If my guess is correct, this weapon of yours should also have been created by that Grandmaster Rainbow from ten thousand years ago?&#x201D;</p><p>After Nangong Tianshi took out his Incomplete Imperial Armament, his battle power immediately increased enormously. However, Chu Feng was not afraid, and instead became even more excited. He truly never expected that both Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi would possess Incomplete Imperial Armaments. To Chu Feng, this was an enormously pleasant surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;You truly do not know how death is written. A calamity is before you, yet you actually dare to think about my Incomplete Imperial Armament.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes were shining. Nangong Tianshi was able to tell with a single glance that Chu Feng had taken a fancy to his Purple Rainbow Sword.</p><p>[1. Could it be that Grandmaster Rainbow created 7 of the same swords with different colors of the rainbow?]</p><p>When Nangong Tianshi thought about how he had taken out his Purple Rainbow Sword for the sake of killing Chu Feng, and seeing how Chu Feng was not afraid and even had a reaction of lusting for his Purple Rainbow Sword, this caused him to grow even more enraged. Thus, he did not bother to say anything to Chu Feng, and he immediately brandished the Purple Rainbow Sword in his hand to attack him.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The Purple Rainbow Sword was truly mighty. Each and every slash from it possessed fatal destructive power capable of slicing through space and shattering the earth. As it slashed through the air, it created cracks of void in the air that lasted for a short moment. However, when it slashed toward the ground, it would leave an everlasting ravine behind. If a slash were to hit Chu Feng, Chu Feng would undoubtedly be killed.</p><p>Furthermore, the slashes shot forth by the Purple Rainbow Sword were not only powerful, they also possessed astonishing speed. In a flash, they arrived before Chu Feng.</p><p>However, those boots on Chu Feng&#x2019;s feet were not worn by him for decorational purposes. Even though the slashes from the Purple Rainbow Sword were extremely mighty and fast, Chu Feng still managed to dodge all of them.</p><p>&#x201C;Trash! Before this Prince&#x2019;s true strength, you only know how to run, isn&#x2019;t that right?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I can tell those boots on your feet are treasures. Else, it would be impossible for you to possess such a speed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, since I&#x2019;ve revealed my Purple Rainbow Sword, you will undoubtedly die,&#x201D; Nangong Tianshi said confidently. However, he was actually trying to attack Chu Feng psychologically to enrage him and make him fight him head-on.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, in that case, maybe you should try hitting me for once,&#x201D; However, his psychological attack did not work on Chu Feng at all. Not only was Chu Feng not enraged by it, he even started to mock and ridicule Nangong Tianshi in return.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
