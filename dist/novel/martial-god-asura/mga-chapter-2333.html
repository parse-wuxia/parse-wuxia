<p><strong> Chapter 2333 - Protecting One&#x2019;s Dignity</strong></p><p>This man was wearing a black gown. His outfit was similar to Old Demon Rakshasa&#x2019;s.</p><p>However, the sensation that this man gave off was completely different from that which Old Demon Rakshasa gave off.</p><p>Old Demon Rakshasa emitted overwhelming killing intent. From a single glance, one could tell that he was not a good individual.</p><p>As for this man, not only did he have the appearance of a middle-aged man, he also appeared to be very good-natured. This was especially true for his eyes; they gave off a very amiable feeling.</p><p>However, upon seeing this person, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart began to waver up and down; he felt extremely uneasy.</p><p>Chu Feng was able to sense that it was not that this man did not possess any heinous air. Rather, the heinous air this man contained might surpass even that of Old Demon Rakshasa. Merely, he had concealed it extremely well, so well that even Chu Feng was unable to detect it.</p><p>If Old Demon Rakshasa was a hungry wolf, than this man would be a tiger in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, quickly, run away.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s voice sounded in Chu Feng&#x2019;s ear. Her voice was filled with panic.</p><p>Not only did Chu Feng sense danger, Her Lady Queen also managed to sense the danger.</p><p>Even if Chu Feng had grasped control of the grand slaughtering formation and could defeat everyone in the Martial Ancestor realm, he would not be able to defeat this man.</p><p>After all, this man was a True Immortal-level expert.</p><p>&#x201C;No, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to escape.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng shook his head. Even though his opponent had not unleashed his True Immortal&#x2019;s oppressive might, he had most definitely come with ill intentions. Furthermore, he was truly powerful. His might surpassed that of everyone present.</p><p>Before this man, it was simply impossible for Chu Feng to escape. Not a single person present would be able to escape. Although he felt very unreconciled, Chu Feng was already certain that he might end up dying here.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahahaha, Chu Feng, no matter how strong your spirit formation might be, it will still be impossible for you to contend against a True Immortal-level expert.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You bunch of fools actually decided to rely on trash like Chu Feng. Look at your stunned expressions now. You must&#x2019;ve never expected that the Infant Soul Sect would possess a True Immortal-level expert overseeing them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, even if you all are to regret your decisions, it would be useless. Not to mention attacking you all, a True Immortal-level expert will be able to kill you by merely blowing air.&#x201D;</p><p>Kou Kang became extremely pleased. He actually pointed at the crowd and burst into loud laughter.</p><p>At that moment, he was truly overjoyed. Originally, he had thought that Old Demon Rakshasa was the strongest individual in the Infant Soul Sect.</p><p>However, he was surprised to discover that there was actually a True Immortal-level expert overseeing things in the Infant Soul Sect.</p><p>It was a True Immortal-level expert! They were peak level existences in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Infant Soul Sect, this power that he had never heard of before, actually possessed a True Immortal-level expert overseeing them. This meant that the Infant Soul Sect possessed strength at the level of a tier one power.</p><p>This meant that they were one of the strongest powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm!!!</p><p>Thinking about it, he, a disciple of a tier two power, had actually managed to become a member of a tier one power out of pure chance. Furthermore, he was chosen by an existence like Old Demon Rakshasa. It would not be excessive to say that he had reached instant success.</p><p>At that moment, Kou Kang truly felt more and more overjoyed the more he thought about it. He felt that he was extremely quick-witted.</p><p>He felt that his decision to renounce the Three Stars Hall and join the Infant Soul Sect was the smartest decision he had ever made in his life.</p><p>&#x201C;The Infant Soul Sect possesses a True Immortal-level expert overseeing it. In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they would be considered a tier one power!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You bunch of ants actually dared to overestimate your abilities to go against a power like this. You all are truly bringing about your own destruction.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, although you might be a talented genius, you are actually a beam-jumping clown. You deserve your death. No one will feel pity for you! Serves you right!!!&#x201D;</p><p>After Kou Kang spoke, more and more people began to insult Chu Feng and the others that had not kneeled to Old Demon Rakshasa.</p><p>Of course, the ones that spoke to insult Chu Feng and the others were the same people who had gone against Chu Feng and declared that newborn infants deserved to die.</p><p>They were people that had already gone to the extreme, leaving no room for maneuver. Originally, they had been worried about what to do as Old Demon Rakshasa had been defeated by Chu Feng. However, upon discovering that the Infant Soul Sect actually possessed a True Immortal-level expert overseeing it, they started to want to join the Infant Soul Sect.</p><p>For the sake of joining the Infant Soul Sect, these people would naturally spare no effort in attacking Chu Feng and the others to flatter the Infant Soul Sect and leave behind a good impression for that Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s True Immortal-level expert.</p><p>As more and more people began to verbally attack Chu Feng, Kou Kang began to feel unhappy. He thought to himself that he could not allow himself to be outdone by these people.</p><p>Thus, he pointed at Chu feng and loudly cursed, &#x201C;Chu Feng, are you ashamed of yourself yet? Did you really think yourself to be extraordinary? Now you know what it means by there are people stronger than you, that there&#x2019;s a greater sky than the one you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Shut up!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>However, before Kou Kang could finish his words, a loud and resounding voice suddenly exploded from the sky.</p><p>When that voice sounded, heaven and earth started to shake, and oppressive might descended from the sky.</p><p>This oppressive might was not very powerful. However, it caused forced Kou Kang and all the others that had opened their mouths to curse at Chu Feng onto their knees.</p><p>It was that True Immortal-level expert. He did not attack Chu Feng, and instead used his oppressive might to restrict Kou Kang and the others. Although he did not kill them, he made them kneel on the ground. His behavior truly puzzled the crowd.</p><p>No one knew exactly what that Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s True Immortal-level expert was thinking. Why was he not attacking Chu Feng, and instead attacking those people that were speaking for their Infant Soul Sect?</p><p>At the moment when the crowd was puzzled, he suddenly turned to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve truly made me have a whole new level of respect for you. Our Infant Soul Sect needs a genius like you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As long as you are willing to join our Infant Soul Sect, not only will I guarantee you a high position and great wealth, I will also kill all these people who have insulted you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What? He actually wants to entice Chu Feng?!&#x201D; Once that True Immortal said those words, the crowd were all astonished.</p><p>As for Kou Kang, who had been feeling immensely proud of himself, his expression instantly turned dejected. He finally realized the disparity between him and Chu Feng.</p><p>Even though he had renounced his dignity, betrayed his school and used all sorts of despicable means to obtain a favorable impression from the Infant Soul Sect, he was completely and utterly defeated by Chu Feng&#x2019;s talent.</p><p>In fact, it was not only Kou Kang who was stunned. All those who were kneeling on the ground were stunned. At that moment, they all realized that the oppressive might that was restricting them was also a sharp sword at their necks.</p><p>As long as Chu Feng gave the word, that True Immortal-level expert would immediately kill them.</p><p>Thinking about it, they were truly sorrowful. For the sake of their own survival, they had disregarded their dignity, betrayed their schools and lied through their teeth.</p><p>However, in the end, they became a bargaining chip for the Infant Soul Sect to entice Chu Feng with.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Protector, this&#x2026;&#x201D; Old Demon Rakshasa opened his mouth. He seemed to want to say something.</p><p>&#x201C;Quiet!&#x201D; However, before he could say anything, he was shouted down by that True Immortal.</p><p>Following that, even though Old Demon Rakshasa was extremely unwilling, he no longer dared to utter another word. Instead, he swallowed down all the grievances that he wanted to voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Join us, and you&#x2019;ll live.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Refuse to join us, and you&#x2019;ll die.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, is there a need for you to ponder such a simple choice?&#x201D; The Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s True Immortal-level expert said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, accept it. A man must submit or stand tall as required. At that moment, what is most important is for you to survive,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said to Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng understood all that. When one survived, there would still be hope. However, should one die, one would not have anything left.</p><p>But, even though he understood all of that, Chu Feng still firmly shook his head.</p><p>With a smile on his face, he said, &#x201C;Firstly, I, Chu Feng, have pledged that I will not join any sect or school in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, even if I did not make such a pledge, I would still absolutely not join the Infant Soul Sect.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The reason for that is because I, Chu Feng, will absolutely not wallow in the mire with people like you all, people that will slaughter even newborn infants!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s words were like a sudden clap of thunder that exploded in the hearts of the crowd.</p><p>They were stunned. Practically everyone present was stunned. Not to mention Kou Kang and the others, even Xu Yiyi and the others did not expect that Chu Feng would refuse that True Immortal-level expert.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Yiyi, those older generation&#x2019;s experts and even some of the people that had kneeled to Old Demon Rakshasa all began to feel admiration toward Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts.</p><p>They were not admiring Chu Feng&#x2019;s talent. Rather, they were admiring Chu Feng&#x2019;s courage and resolution.</p><p>After all, what Chu Feng had done was use his own life to protect his dignity and principles.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
