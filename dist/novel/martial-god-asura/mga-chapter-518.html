<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 518 - I Am The Azure Dragon Founder</strong></p><p><span style="">*boom rumble rumble*</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, another explosion burst out in the sky. At the same time, a berserk energy ripple spread circularly, and in the areas it passed, the air twisted.</span></p><p><span style="">Within the ten days, explosions such as that could be said to have rang out countless times, but this time, it was especially eye-catching.</span></p><p><span style="">Because after this explosion, because of physical exhaustion, Chu Feng was finally unable to evade in time and was struck by the remnant ripple, causing him to fall from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng!&#x201D; Seeing that, Jiang Hengyuan hurried leaped and caught Chu Feng into his embrace.</span></p><p><span style="">But in the instant he held Chu Feng, Jiang Hengyuan&#x2019;s expression changed because he could feel how weak the current Chu Feng was. He was truly extremely weak.</span></p><p><span style="">Furthermore, the power he gained from the Royal Bloodline Attachment Formation was disappearing rapidly. Very soon, Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura turned from the 8th level of the Heaven realm to the 2nd level of the Heaven realm.</span></p><p><span style="">And after the lightning in his eyes disappeared, Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura continued to slide down. He returned to his real cultivation, the 9th level of the Profound realm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you okay?&#x201D; After Chu Feng landed on the ground, everyone surrounded him. Within the gaze they looked at Chu Feng with, there was worry, there was pain, but even more, there was gratitude.</span></p><p><span style="">Although right now, they were still unable to avoid death, within the time of ten days, they already secretly moved Jiang Yini and the others, from the dynasty&#x2019;s young generation, away, and that chance was completely fought for by Chu Feng himself with his own strength.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201D; Although he no longer had the power of the Royal Bloodline Attachment Formation, Chu Feng&#x2019;s face turned quite better, and that was exactly because Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t need to exhaust extremely large amounts of strength to stabilize the power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha, so it was a brat in the 9th level of the Profound realm. You truly do have quite some skill to be actually able to stabilize such powerful aura with a cultivation like that and forcefully fight against us two for ten days and ten nights.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But sadly, at the end, the young is ignorant! You didn&#x2019;t know that we were intentionally dragging the battle out, dragging it until the power that didn&#x2019;t belong to you disappeared! Hahaha...&#x201D; Suddenly, the smug laughter of the Ji Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor rang out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh? Really? You truly think that you will definitely win today?&#x201D; Chu Feng suddenly coldly smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Brat, do you think you still have a chance to win?&#x201D; The Liu Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor asked mockingly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I naturally knew that you were intentionally stalling for time.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But you absolutely would not have thought that I too was also intentionally stalling for time.&#x201D; Chu Feng coldly smiled and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You were stalling for time as well? What&#x2019;s the point of you stalling for time?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh, I know. So you were using that time to move some people of the Jiang Dynasty away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Too naive. It is but a group of people in the young generation. Do you truly think they can successfully escape? If I want to eradicate them, they will absolutely not be able to escape this continent of the Nine Provinces.&#x201D; After the Ji Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor scanned downwards at the ground, he saw some clues.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wrong. The reason why I stalled for time was not for that. It was to wait for reinforcements which can destroy all of you.&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly smiled and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Reinforcements?! Who are you scaring? Right now, in the continent of the Nine Provinces, is it possible that you can still find a person who can defeat us?&#x201D; It had to be said that the word &#x201C;reinforcement&#x201D; caused the Liu Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor to panic a bit.</span></p><p><span style="">Because, after constant fighting for ten days and ten nights, he truly experienced the unsimpleness of Chu Feng. Although he and the Ji Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor did indeed drag the battle out, such actions was a method within no methods.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, the two of them originally wanted to quickly kill Chu Feng with their combined powers and solidify their state of victory, but they could do nothing as Chu Feng was really too strong. Not only was his battle power not weak, his reactions were extremely quick as well.</span></p><p><span style="">Not only were the two of them unable to suppress Chu Feng in terms of battle power, their tactics were seen through one after the other by Chu Feng. In the battle of ten days, they could truly be said to be &#x201C;setting up camp at every step&#x201D; as they very gradually advanced forward, and their minds were thoroughly exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="">So, when Chu Feng said he had reinforcements, he believed it. Not only did he believe it, he also panicked. In this continent of the Nine Provinces, if there was even a young man like Chu Feng, perhaps there was truly an even more powerful person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do not believe this brat&#x2019;s nonsense! If his Jiang Dynasty had reinforcements, they would have already appeared. How could they have let us destroy the formation?&#x201D; The Ji Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. It&#x2019;s up to you whether you believe it or not. Right now, a catastrophe is already heading your way, and you won&#x2019;t make it out in time even if you retreat right now.&#x201D; Chu Feng did not explain as well, and only continued to coldly smile and speak, as if he had already seen the scene of the two clans being annihilated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A catastrophe is heading our way? From what I see, a catastrophe is heading </span><i><span style="">your</span></i><span style=""> way, you brat. Without temporarily gained power from other places, what can you use to fight against me? Watch my casual move of a finger crush you to death.&#x201D; The Ji Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor waved his sleeve, stuck out his finger, and prepared to attack Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would quite like to see who dares to touch Chu Feng!&#x201D; But just at that time, a thunder-like explosive shout suddenly burst out from the distant horizon, and at the same time, an enormous aura quickly followed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The 9th level of the Heaven realm?&#x201D; At that instant, the faces of almost everyone on scene changed greatly. Especially the Ji Dynasty&#x2019;s and the Liu Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestors. They had panicking expressions</span></p><p><span style="">It was because they could both clearly feel that the aura of the 9th level of the Heaven realm was speedily approaching.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! Is it possible that what Chu Feng said was true, and he truly has reinforcements?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, let alone the people from the Ji Dynasty and Liu Dynasty, even the crowd of the Jiang Dynasty were endlessly shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">Originally, they also thought that Chu Feng&#x2019;s words were for scaring the people from the two clans, but looking at the situation now, what Chu Feng said was true!</span></p><p><span style="">*wuaoo* Just at that time, a dragon&#x2019;s cry suddenly rang out. The formation enveloping the dynasty immediately dissipated, and quickly after, an azure light flew over from the clouds, and only stopped after arriving above Chu Feng and the others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! This is?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, after seeing the original shape of the azure light, everyone couldn&#x2019;t help but gasp deeply because at that very instant, what appeared above them was an incomparably huge azure dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">Although the Azure Dragon was condensed and formed by azure-coloured gas, the dragon scales, the dragon claws, the overbearing state, it was simply vivid and lifelike, and not too far off from a real dragon.</span></p><p><span style="">On the head of the Azure Dragon, two figures stood there. Many people on scene who were from the continent of the Nine Provinces recognized one of them. The big brother of Chu Feng, the expert in the 8th level of the Heaven realm, the Monstrous Monkey King.</span></p><p><span style="">And in front of the Monstrous Monkey King, there stood an old man who had white- and grey-hair. He held a fly whisk, wore a robe, and had an unsecular air around him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D; Seeing that person, the Ji Dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor also tightly frowned. Although they were both in the 9th level of the Heaven realm, he felt a threatening feeling from the old man. His opponent&#x2019;s cultivation was very strong, already infinitely nearing the Martial Lord realm, an existence that was going become a Martial Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">Facing his question, the azure-robed old man waved the whisk in his hand, then lightly smiled and said, &#x201C;My name remains the same regardless of anything. I am the Azure Dragon Founder!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
