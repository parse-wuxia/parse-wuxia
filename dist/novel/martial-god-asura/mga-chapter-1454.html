<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1454 - The Defeat Of Both Grandfather And Grandson</strong></p><p>At this moment, the majority of the people, including even Miao Renlong, started to become nervous.</p><p>As matters stood, they had all experienced how powerful Chu Feng was. Who among them would not wish for Chu Feng to join their World Spiritist Alliance?</p><p>Merely, they were all afraid that Chu Feng would refuse, they were afraid that their World Spiritist Alliance would lose out on such an extraordinary genius.</p><p>With hopes and fears tangled together, they naturally became extremely nervous.</p><p>&#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t be trying to have little friend Chu Feng join our World Spiritist Alliance, right?&#x201D; At the moment when everyone already knew what the Alliance Master was trying to do, someone asked that question even though he already knew the answer.</p><p>It was a black-haired man who was nearly a thousand years old. However, he had managed to maintain his appearance as that of a middle-aged man.</p><p>That said, regardless of how youthful his appearance might be, the grin of dissatisfaction on his face was extremely clear. To dare speak to the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master in such a manner, this person was naturally an elder of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly.</p><p>In fact, not only was he an elder of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly, he was also Lin Kuxing&#x2019;s son, Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s father.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, to be honest, it is true that I wish to invite little friend Chu Feng to join our World Spiritist Alliance,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master nodded with a smile on his face.</p><p>Then, he looked to Chu Feng and continued, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, world spiritists are a bunch of special people. They are people who have grasped a very strong power, and thus receive both respect and hostility from others. However, ultimately, world spiritists are a bunch of similar people.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The way I see it, we should all be a family. We should unite with one another and help each other without abandoning or giving up on others.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I understand why you have refused to join our World Spiritist Alliance for so long. It must be because you are a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. The way you saw it, if you were to join our World Spiritist Alliance, it would be a betrayal of your Cyanwood Mountain.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the truth is, that is not at all the case. It is totally possible for you to join our World Spiritist Alliance even with your identity as a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. That would not be a betrayal. At the very most, it just means that you&#x2019;ll have another place to call home.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, even the Cyanwood Mountain will definitely not blame you for your decision. As long as you&#x2019;re willing, I can personally write to them and explain this matter to your Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s headmaster.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, join us. Although I have never forced anyone to join our World Spiritist Alliance in the past, you are different. Our large family needs you as a family member.&#x201D;</p><p>This time around, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master could be said to have said everything he&apos;d been holding in. Furthermore, he said those words with sincerity. He wanted Chu Feng to join them from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>He truly hoped that Chu Feng would join their World Spiritist Alliance. He truly did not wish to miss out on such an extraordinary genius world spiritist.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng was also moved. Although there were a lot of people in the World Spiritist Alliance who viewed him as him as an enemy, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master, Miao Renlong and the Left Reverend had treated him extremely well.</p><p>Moreover, his lover Su Mei also resided here. Furthermore, she would be here for a long time.</p><p>Truth be told, compared to the Cyanwood Mountain, the World Spiritist Alliance truly gave him a sense of home.</p><p>&#x201C;Clap, clap, clap, clap&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when Chu Feng was hesitating, an applause suddenly sounded. It was Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s father. There was currently a strange smile on his face.</p><p>As he clapped his hands, he said, &#x201C;What marvelous words those are. I can tell that you truly wanted Chu Feng to join us from the bottom of your heart.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, little friend Chu Feng does not fancy our World Spiritist Alliance. Even if you can turn your words into blossoming flowers, he will still not join us.&#x201D;</p><p>Mockery. Extreme mockery. Those words he spoke were not mocking Chu Feng. Instead, he was mocking the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master.</p><p>That said, anyone that was intelligent was able to realize that Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s father had only acted that way and said those words because he did not wish for Chu Feng to join the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>As for the reason why he didn&#x2019;t want Chu Feng to join the World Spiritist Alliance, it was actually not hard to realize. After all, his son, Lin Yezhou, was still the number one disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance. At the very least, he was still the number one male disciple.</p><p>If Chu Feng were to join the World Spiritist Alliance, Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s position would be put in a position of imminent danger, so much so that he would not be able to keep it.</p><p>In the end, it was all for their own selfishness. This was not only limited to Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s father. Even his grandfather Lin Kuxing&#x2019;s previous action of targeting Chu Feng had also been because of selfishness. As for the reason why they were acting selfishly, it was for Lin Yezhou.</p><p>&#x201C;Who said that I&#x2019;m going to refuse?&#x201D; However, who would&#x2019;ve thought that at this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Lin Yezhou, his father, his mother, his grandfather and his grandmother were all stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you mean?&#x201D; At this moment, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master became emotional. In fact, he did not even dare to ascertain what Chu Feng meant by those words.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Alliance Master, the reason why Chu Feng had refused before is because Chu Feng felt that his abilities were insufficient and that he was not qualified to become a disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance yet.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, with how highly Lord Alliance Master thinks of this Chu Feng, how Lord Alliance Master does not mind how weak and small this Chu Feng is right now, Chu Feng also cannot find grounds to refuse.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If Lord Alliance Master still does not mind this Chu Feng, then, Chu Feng is willing to join the World Spiritist Alliance and become a part of it,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a serious expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course not, how could I possibly mind little friend Chu Feng? Haha, with little friend Chu Feng joining our World Spiritist Alliance, this is a truly happy occasion.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Send the order, I am going to hold a banquet in the plaza tomorrow to celebrate little friend Chu Feng joining our World Spiritist Alliance.&#x201D; The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master was truly overjoyed. He had actually decided to hold a banquet for Chu Feng, a single person, joining the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>&#x201C;No, to be this bombastic is not sensible. At the very least, we cannot let others know that little friend Chu Feng is that Feng Chu who defeated Dongfang Zexuan. Otherwise, I fear that we will court disaster for little friend Chu Feng,&#x201D; The Left Reverend said cautiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, what Lord Reverend says is correct. I will announce that the banquet tomorrow is a celebration of our defeat of the Dongfang Imperial Clan. At the same time, I will also publicly announce that little friend Chu Feng has joined our World Spiritist Alliance. After all, little friend Chu Feng is the first Asura World Spiritist in our World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s entire history.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the matter regarding Feng Chu, if I am to keep quiet and not talk about it, I doubt there will be anyone who dares to ask about it,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, that would do,&#x201D; The Left Reverend nodded his head in approval.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve finally joined us. Now, we&#x2019;re truly a family,&#x201D; Suddenly, Sima Ying jumped over to Chu Feng and, without caring about the gazes of the elders, grabbed onto his hand and started to jump and hop. She was happily celebrating Chu Feng&#x2019;s joining.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, I never would&#x2019;ve thought that you&#x2019;d be this powerful. In the future, please take care of me,&#x201D; Seeing that Sima Ying was actually getting so intimate with her man before her, Su Mei also walked over to not be outdone.</p><p>Not only did she grab onto Chu Feng&#x2019;s other hand, she also pretended to ambiguously place her delicate body into Chu Feng&#x2019;s bosom. It was truly intimate. Even Sima Ying was stunned by her actions.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, these two girls actually started to rival each other for the affection of a man&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>As the crowd was all feeling extremely good right now, they did not say anything about Su Mei and Sima Ying&#x2019;s reaction, even though it came as a great surprise to them. Instead, they started to laugh joyously and thought that the two of them were fighting each other because they had both become fond of Chu Feng.</p><p>However, as the saying goes, one man&#x2019;s joy is another man&#x2019;s sorrow. At the moment when the majority of the crowd was feeling happy for Chu Feng, Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s heart was bleeding.</p><p>He was feeling a very deep pain. Not only had Chu Feng joined the World Spiritist Alliance, his two beloveds were fighting one another for Chu Feng&#x2019;s affection. This was truly too unbearable for him.</p><p>Alongside Lin Yezhou, his grandfather, his grandmother, his father and his mother were also feeling very uncomfortable.</p><p>They had already known that Lin Yezhou was interested in Sima Ying and Su Mei. However, they had all realized that Sima Ying and Su Mei&#x2019;s hearts were not with Lin Yezhou at all.</p><p>Those two girls could be said to be very lively, cheerful and affectionate toward Chu Feng. However, they would refuse to even take a glance at Lin Yezhou. This enormous difference was akin to ice and fire. While Chu Feng was standing on top of the fire, Lin Yezhou was sitting on top of the ice.</p><p>Even a fool could tell that it was most likely hopeless for Lin Yezhou. At the very least, his luck with women was not at all comparable to Chu Feng&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Sigh~~~&#x201D; Feeling helpless, Lin Kuxing could only sigh. Today, he had been defeated by Chu Feng. Furthermore, even his grandson had been defeated by Chu Feng. The defeat of both the grandfather and the grandson, this was truly a sorrowful day.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
