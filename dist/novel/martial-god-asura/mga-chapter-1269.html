<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1269 - Monstrous Dragon Beast King</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Bai Yunxiao and the others all shot out at the same time like six sharp swords and landed in the calm Boundless Green Sea.</p><p>In an instant, water splattered all over. Everyone knew that from this moment on, that water would no longer be peaceful.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuaaooouu~~~~~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Sure enough, not long after they entered the Boundless Green Sea, angry roars began to resound from its depths.</p><p>Closely following that, surging billows began to appear on the previously calm lake surface. As green-colored splashes formed in the water, one huge monster after another emerged from the depths and started to violently struggle.</p><p>Of these large monsters, the biggest among them was a hundred meters long, whereas the smallest among them was only thirty meters long. Their bodies were black in color and filled with steel-like scales.</p><p>Before them, Bai Yunxiao and the others seemed so utterly small. As for these creatures, they were naturally the Monstrous Dragon Beasts.</p><p>These Monstrous Dragon Beasts appeared similar to enormous black water pythons. However, since they were named Monstrous Dragon Beasts, there was most definitely something special about them. Even their appearances were exceptionally fierce and tough.</p><p>At this moment, these Monstrous Dragon Beasts were disturbed. Each and every one of them was filled with incomparable rage. Not only were they facing the sky and hissing, they were also releasing their powerful might and swinging their enormous bodies back and forth. Waves appeared in the lake and ripples began to wreak havoc throughout the region. It was truly a spectacular mess, extremely frightening.</p><p>Furthermore, these Monstrous Dragon Beasts were opening their large ferocious mouths and spraying black liquid out from them; they actually began to directly attack Bai Yunxiao and the other five Cyanwood Mountain disciples.</p><p>However, even with all this, the Monstrous Dragon Beasts were simply no match for Bai Yunxiao and the others. While Bai Yunxiao and the others might appear to be very small compared to these Monstrous Dragon Beasts, the power that their bodies contained was extremely large; none of them were ordinary characters.</p><p>Every one of the six either possessed a very powerful Bloodline, trained in a special Mysterious Technique, or were Divine Bodies.</p><p>Thus, regardless of how powerful these Monstrous Dragon Beasts might be, they were, in fact, simply incapable of contending against Bai Yunxiao and the others.</p><p>In merely the blink of an eye, the blood-curdling screeches of the Monstrous Dragon Beasts rang out in succession. Their enormous bodies were chopped into multiple pieces. Soon, the lake was dyed red with their blood.</p><p>However, these Monstrous Dragon Beasts were merely the first wave. After killing them, Bai Yunxiao and the others did not stop. Instead, they once again dove into the Boundless Green Sea and began to drive wave upon wave of Monstrous Dragon Beasts to the surface of the water so that they could kill them.</p><p>At this moment, they did not appear to be doing an extremely difficult mission at all. Instead, it appeared more like a ruthless massacre.</p><p>&#x201C;So powerful. As expected of the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s strongest disciples. Their strength is simply too powerful.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. All of them possess extraordinary battle power. Especially that disciple with the rank eight Martial King cultivation, it is likely that no one is a worthy match for him among the Martial Kings. Even rank one Half Martial Emperors might not be able to contend against him.&#x201D;</p><p>However, this sort of massacre was what the crowd loved the most. As they watched, they began to commend the six disciples. It could be said that they were truly enjoying themselves.</p><p>In this sort of situation, Bai Yunxiao and the others were immensely pleased with themselves. The more they fought, the more valiant they became. They had already transformed that green lake into a bright red sea of blood. The lake was filled with Monstrous Dragon Beasts&#x2019; blood and was emitting a nauseating fleshy smell.</p><p>&#x201C;This is truly boring. The so-called dragon grade mission is only at this level of difficulty?&#x201D; Sima Ying was unable to sit tight anymore. To her, a show of massacre like this was truly boring.</p><p>&#x201C;Even though we know that this is simply a show to begin with, it would be truly too boring if it were to end in this sort of manner,&#x201D; Even Bai Ruochen was unable to continue watching this.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be anxious, the best part is about to come,&#x201D; Compared to the two of them, Chu Feng had an expression of anticipation on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what did you see?&#x201D; At this moment, both Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying looked to Chu Feng. Even Bai Suyan shifted her gaze toward Chu Feng.</p><p>While all of them possessed very powerful world spiritist techniques, all of them were envious of Chu Feng, even Bai Suyan, who was a royal-cloak world spiritist. That was because they all knew that Chu Feng possessed a pair of extremely powerful eyes that were capable of seeing what they could not.</p><p>&#x201C;The Monstrous Dragon Beasts are not as useless as they seem. They are planning to counterattack soon,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying were overjoyed. Immediately, their dispirited eyes filled with enthusiasm. They were unable to turn their gazes away from the Boundless Green Sea.</p><p>At this moment, the joy on their faces grew even more intense. That was because they, upon closer inspection, managed to see that there was change happening in the depths of the Boundless Green Sea.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang.&#x201D;</p><p>Sure enough, not long after Chu Feng said those words, countless large splashes of water shot into the sky from the surface of the lake like enormous dragons.</p><p>Following every single splash was the appearance of a Monstrous Dragon Beast. In the blink of an eye, over a thousand Monstrous Dragon Beasts appeared, completely surrounding Bai Yunxiao and the others.</p><p>The Monstrous Dragon Beasts this time around were much more powerful than the ones from the previous waves. Not only were they bigger in size, their cultivations were also much stronger. There was even one among them that was two hundred meters long.</p><p>Its tail was floating on top of the lake like a small mountain. As for its head, it was truly the head of a frightening monster.</p><p>Its large mouth was easily capable of devouring an entire palace. Those enormous sharp teeth seemed like death&#x2019;s scythe, capable of penetrating into anything.</p><p>However, the most powerful aspect of this Monstrous Dragon Beast was not its frightening appearance. Instead, it was its cultivation. Its cultivation had entered the Half Martial Emperor level. It was a rank one Half Martial Emperor Monstrous Dragon Beast.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Didn&#x2019;t the chief of the Yuanshi Tribe say that the leader of the Monstrous Dragon Beasts was only a rank nine Martial King? How did it turn into a rank one Half Martial Emperor?&#x201D;</p><p>When they saw this Monstrous Dragon Beast, even Tao Xiangyu and the others started to frown. A trace of fear emerged in their eyes. Half Martial Emperors were most definitely not beings that Martial Kings could compare with.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s there to be afraid of? Isn&#x2019;t it just a rank one Half Martial Emperor? I&#x2019;ll handle it, you all handle the remaining ones.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, only Bai Yunxiao remained calm and collected. With a flip of his palm, a three meter long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Once he took out his Royal Armament, his aura immediately increased in strength. Not only did the sky begin to change in color, thunder and lightning also began to appear. At the same time, with him as the center, a gale appeared on the lake and began to splatter water everywhere, turning it into a torrential rain.</p><p>Before the battle even started, Bai Yunxiao was already threatening his opponent with the display of his might.</p><p>&#x201C;Little bastards of the Cyanwood Mountain, there is neither grievance nor hatred between our Monstrous Dragon Beast clan and you all. Why have you come to massacre us?&#x201D; Right at this moment, that Monstrous Dragon Beast king spoke with a deep and hoarse voice.</p><p>&#x201C;You all have seized the territory of the Yuanshi Tribe and willfully slaughtered the innocent. As such, you should be exterminated,&#x201D; Bai Yunxiao said.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if we have seized another&#x2019;s territory, what does this have to do with you all?&#x201D; The Monstrous Dragon Beast king asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your bullshit, prepare to die!&#x2019; As for Bai Yunxiao, he did not want to bother speaking with the Monstrous Dragon Beast king. The Royal Armament Spear in his hand was abruptly raised. Immediately, waves of water surged into the sky. Those waves that were raised by his spear turned into an enormous wall of water. That enormous wall of water was filled with murderous power as it charged toward the Monstrous Dragon Beast king.</p><p>Bai Yunxiao&#x2019;s attack was very fast, accurate and ruthless. It landed directly on the Monstrous Dragon Beast king.</p><p>However, as the splatters that reached the sky gradually fell back into the lake, that Monstrous Dragon Beast king was not at all damaged. Furthermore, its crimson-colored eyes were emitting a very dense killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;Little bastard, you&#x2019;re truly courting death,&#x201D; His furious snarl resounded throughout heaven and earth.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
