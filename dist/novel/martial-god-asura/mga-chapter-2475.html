<p><strong> Chapter 2475 - Allies Attacked</strong></p><p>After that elder hesitated for a moment, he said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, this matter is indeed related to you. However, there is nothing you can do about it. Thus, after I tell you what it is, you must definitely remain calm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will remain calm. Senior, please go ahead,&#x201D; Chu Feng said calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Ying Heavenly Clan. The Ying Heavenly Clan is currently attacking the Three Stars Hall. I fear that they would have already reached the headquarters of the Three Stars Hall by now,&#x201D; That elder said.</p><p>&#x201C;The Ying Heavenly Clan? Sure enough, they ended up attacking the Three Stars Hall,&#x201D; Chu Feng started to frown upon hearing those words. Then, he said to Liu Xiaoli, &#x201C;Do you have a map of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&#x201D;</p><p>Naturally, the reason why Chu Feng wanted a map was so that he could find a way to proceed to the Three Stars Hall to reinforce them.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you really planning to involve yourself in this?&#x201D; Liu Xiaoli asked.</p><p>&#x201C;This matter was caused by me to begin with. Thus, I cannot find a reason to ignore it,&#x201D; Chu Feng said determinedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed. That&#x2019;s the Chu Feng I know. It would appear that it would be useless for me to urge you against this,&#x201D; Liu Xiaoli shook her head with a smile. She had a helpless expression on her face.</p><p>Then, she said, &#x201C;Three Stars Hall is actually not far from here. I can show you the way.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing what Liu Xiaoli said, Chu Feng&#x2019;s extremely worried heart felt some ease.</p><p>He felt that since the Ying Heavenly Clan dared to attack the Three Stars Hall, it meant that they had obtained certainty in being able to take care of them.</p><p>After all, the Ying Heavenly Clan had already submitted to Chu Luxuan. Likely, their strength was no longer comparable to before.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that the situation would be bad for the Three Stars Hall.</p><p>However, if it was truly as Liu Xiaoli had said, and the Three Stars Hall was not far from where they were,then he would still be able to reinforce them in time.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a gentle breeze swirled up. Then, Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli disappeared together.</p><p>Not only did their bodies disappear, but even their auras completely disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The crowd all knew that Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli had left.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng and Lady Society President are simply too impulsive. Not only did that Ying Heavenly Clan gather all of their elites, they have also obtained the assistance of many experts. With the cultivation that the two of them possess, even if they are to go there, they will only be throwing away their lives.&#x201D;</p><p>After Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli left, the elder who had returned to report the matter became abnormally panicky.</p><p>&#x201C;Throwing away their lives? That might not be the case,&#x201D; However, at that moment, the other elders of the Red Butterfly Society started to smile profoundly.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong with you all? Little friend Chu Feng and Lady Society Master are planning to confront the Ying Heavenly Clan. The current Ying Heavenly Clan is incomparable to before. It is a tier two power that not even that Three Stars Hall can contend against. How can you all smile at a time like this?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that the crowd was not only calm and composed, but even smiling on top of that, he felt so furious that his complexion turned pale.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve just returned, and you don&#x2019;t know about the situation at hand. All you know is that the Ying Heavenly Clan has become more powerful after becoming Chu Luxuan&#x2019;s subordinates. But, do you know what sort of cultivation little friend Chu Feng possesses right now?&#x201D; someone asked with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;What sort of cultivation?&#x201D; That elder asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank seven Martial Ancestor,&#x201D; The crowd replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank seven Martial Ancestor?&#x201D;</p><p>That elder was immediately stunned upon hearing those words. He asked, &#x201C;With or without using his Heavenly Bloodline?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation is before using his Heavenly Bloodline,&#x201D; The crowd from the Red Butterfly Society replied in unison again.</p><p>&#x201C;Sssss~~~&#x201D; Hearing those words, that elder immediately sucked in a mouthful of cold air. At the same time, his expression turned exceptionally marvelous. The next moment, he grew silent.</p><p>After being silent for a long time, he spoke again, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng is truly godly. It would seem that my worries were unnecessary. The ones that are out of luck is not the Three Stars Hall, nor is it little friend Chu Feng and Lady Society Master. Rather, it is that Ying Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>As he said those words, that elder did not have the slightest bit of worry on his face anymore. Instead, it was replaced with an overjoyed expression.</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>The Three Stars Hall was constructed above a vast plain.</p><p>Originally, the Three Stars Hall did not control a very large area. However, in the two years that&apos;d passed many of their neighboring powers had requested to join them and become their subsidiary powers out of their own initiative.</p><p>Thus, in a short period of merely two years, the Three Stars Hall became a huge monster in the area.</p><p>However, at that moment, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s various subsidiary powers and branches were attacked.</p><p>Even the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headquarters was no exception.</p><p>At that moment, above the vast group of palaces in the Three Stars Hall was a semitransparent spirit formation fort. That spirit formation fort covered the entire Three Stars Hall.</p><p>Above the fort were countless silhouettes wearing Thunder Armor with Thunder Wings extending from their backs. They were holding weapons and unleashing magnificent martial skills to attack the semitransparent spirit formation fort nonstop.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom, boom, boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>With those nonstop attacks, rumbles could be heard continuously.</p><p>Deep inside the Three Stars Hall, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s guardian elders were all putting forth their utmost effort to continue maintaining the grand defensive formation. Still, that grand defensive formation that protected the Three Stars Hall was currently riddled with scars after being bombarded by the attacks from the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s army nonstop. At that moment, it was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Headmaster, the things they&#x2019;re using are simply too strange. Our grand defensive formation will likely not be able to hold them back much longer. What should we do?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that their grand defensive formation was about to be breached by the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s ferocious army, many people in the Three Stars Hall started to panic. With no other choice, they looked to their Headmaster.</p><p>Originally, their grand defensive formation had been extremely powerful. Logically, it would have been very difficult for anyone below the True Immortal level of cultivation to breach their grand defensive formation.</p><p>However, the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s army had sprinkled a special sort of liquid over their Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s grand defensive formation.</p><p>Through the decaying effect of that liquid, their Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s grand defensive formation had been greatly weakened. If it were to continue, their grand defensive formation would, sooner or later, be breached.</p><p>When their opponents were capable of even breaching their grand defensive formation, the people in the Three Stars Hall would naturally be extremely worried that they would not be a match for the Ying Heavenly Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Counter soldiers with arms, water with an earthen weir. If it&#x2019;s a battle they want, then it is a battle we shall give them.&#x201D;</p><p>[Editor&#x2019;s note: a weir is a barrier in a river that changes its behavior--similar to the behavior of a dam]</p><p>Compared to the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s elders, their Headmaster&#x2019;s expression remained unchanged. He was exceptionally calm, and reacted with the airs of a ruler that a headmaster should possess.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. What&#x2019;s there to fear? Their Ying Heavenly Clan is merely relying on the power of their Heavenly Bloodline. In terms of actual cultivation, they are much inferior to our Lord Headmaster,&#x201D; Many elders echoed.</p><p>The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster was a rank eight Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation.</p><p>Although he was not a peak Martial Ancestor, as he possessed the cultivation of a rank eight Martial Ancestor and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation, he was stronger than even ordinary peak Martial Ancestors.</p><p>He was the main reason why the Three Stars Hall had always been one of the relatively stronger tier two powers.</p><p>As for the Ying Heavenly Clan, although their status among the tier two powers had always been on par with the Three Stars Hall, their Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had remained a rank four Martial Ancestor all these years.</p><p>He only possessed the strength to barely contend against the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster due to his Thunder Wings, Thunder Armor and his Heavenly Bloodline&#x2019;s heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p><p>However, if their true levels of cultivation were to be compared, there was a total of four levels of difference in cultivation. Thus, many of the people in the Three Stars Hall looked down on the Ying Heavenly Clansmen.</p><p>After all, if their Heavenly Bloodline&#x2019;s power were to be removed, and only their talent was considered, the Ying Heavenly Clansmen were inferior to everyone in the Three Stars Hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a loud explosion sounded from outside. The grand defensive formation that surrounded the Three Stars Hall was crumbling. It had been shattered into countless bright lights. With overflowing flames that brightened the sky, the shattered pieces were falling from the sky and basking the entire Three Stars Hall in a red hue.</p><p>As if it was the arrival of doomsday, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s grand defensive formation had been breached!!!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
