<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 931 - Saving Qiu Canfeng</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Piaomiao, what are you planning to do?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m planning to do, it&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re planning to do. From start to finish, the success of this will depend on you.&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao looked at Chu Feng seriously.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Please give me some advice, Lady Piaomiao,&#x201D; Chu Feng pleaded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, do you remember the Demon Sealing Sword in the Depraved Valley?&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I do,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That Demon Sealing Sword is the weapon of the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s sect head. After he passed away, there has been no one who&#x2019;s been able to pull it out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, I&#x2019;ve heard before the sect head died, he had said if there were a person who could pull out the Demon Sealing Sword, that person would rule the entire Crippling Night Demon Sect. And, if I&#x2019;m not mistaken, you are able to pull it out,&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Piaomiao, you want me to command the Crippling Night Demon Sect? Then, while they create chaos, have me look for an opportunity and reach the Mysterious Technique Tablet in the Misty Peak?&#x201D; Chu Feng suddenly understood a few things.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I have a plan, but it requires many people for its success. As such, the Crippling Night Demon Sect must follow our commands.&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But if this fails, doesn&#x2019;t it mean everyone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect will die with us?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a frown.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. That&#x2019;s why I said this is a &#x2018;make or break&#x2019; gamble. We can only succeed. Failure is not an option.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Besides, that is only one of the reasons. The other reason is that you must have the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Although Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s only a rank four Martial King, his strength is definitely not as simple as it was when I fought him. He didn&#x2019;t even use a Royal Armament, so he definitely has some sort of hidden trump card.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if you are powerful, perhaps as powerful as him, it will still be very difficult to defeat him with the techniques you currently possess.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, that Demon Sealing Sword contains endless power. In the Eastern Sea Region, it is the king of Royal Armaments. After you refine the Pearl of Immortal Inheritance, then fight Jiang Qisha with the Demon Sealing Sword, your chance of victory will be a bit greater,&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, I understand. Back then, I&#x2019;ve seen their deactivation technique in the Depraved Ravine. So, it won&#x2019;t be hard to get my hands on the Demon Sealing Sword. However, I&#x2019;m afraid it won&#x2019;t be as easy to hold command over the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It will be especially harder when news of the Misty Peak spreads. The degree and amount of conflicts and resentments won&#x2019;t matter anymore. It&#x2019;s likely the Crippling Night Demon Sect won&#x2019;t dare to meet them head-on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, if I want to command the Crippling Night Demon Sect, then I would have to save my master first,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Save your master? What happened to Qiu Canfeng?&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao was taken aback. She also wanted Chu Feng&#x2019;s master to appear and help Chu Feng control the Crippling Night Demon Sect, but clearly she didn&#x2019;t know anything regarding Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s imprisonment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mother, since it was a bit urgent, I forgot to tell you. Actually, Qiu Canfeng is&#x2026;&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan knew what happened, so she quickly told Lady Piaomiao about that he was confined in the continent of the Nine Provinces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would have never expected Qiu Canfeng to be this lucky and survive from such a dangerous thing like the Imperial Tomb. But Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t worry. If, as you said, Fu Liansheng has the strength to save your master, then we have no problem doing the same right now.&#x201D; She cast her gaze towards Taikou.</span></p><p><span style="">Taikou was already prepared. He patted his chest, guaranteeing, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. Leave this to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After confirming Taikou would come, Chu Feng wanted to head to the continent of the Nine Provinces with the two of them only, but after some further consideration, they decided to all go together and leave the Eastern Sea Region for safety&#x2019;s sake.</span></p><p><span style="">On that very day, they began their journey.</span></p><p><span style="">The continent of the Nine Provinces was quite far away from the Eastern Sea Region. However, for an expert like a Martial King, that distance wasn&#x2019;t really anything.</span></p><p><span style="">After several short days, they had arrived at the eastern continents. But in order to avoid accidents from happening, they didn&#x2019;t bring with them Lady Piaomiao, who had already lost her cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="">Instead, they sent her to the hiding location of everyone from the continent of the Nine Provinces. They also had Qiushui Fuyan stay there to take care of Lady Piaomiao.</span></p><p><span style="">Only after settling her down did Chu Feng begin again with Taikou. They came to the continent of the Nine Provinces and snuck into the Imperial Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">There were many dangers inside, and also many traps. They were created in a cycle, so even if they were destroyed, they would automatically repair themselves after a while and once again become a barrier of traps that sealed off the Imperial Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Taikou, the rank four Martial King, was no pushover. Although he wasn&#x2019;t as powerful as Huangfu Haoyue, who had the strength to barge through everything, it wasn&#x2019;t difficult for him to destroy the traps.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, after passing through the many obstacles, Chu Feng and Taikou arrived at the deepest part of the Imperial Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What a powerful Imperial Door. This Imperial Tomb is truly not simple at all!&#x201D; From quite some distance away, Chu Feng and Taikou saw the Imperial Door that stood vertical, glowed with golden radiance, and had an inviolable holy aura around it.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng, who once again saw the Imperial Door, felt rather sentimental as he recollected his former weak state. He had become many times stronger, but even so, the Imperial Door still gave him the same feeling as before. Nothing felt different despite his increase in strength.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My master is over there. The thing that is binding him is called the Four Symbols Binding Formation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">They just gave the Imperial Door a glimpse before Chu Feng cast his gaze towards a distant formation, as he was more concerned with Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s current state.</span></p><p><span style="">The formation was very powerful, and on its four sides were the engravings of four fierce huge beasts&#x2014;it was the Four Symbols Binding Formation that bound Qiu Canfeng.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he was sleeping deeply within the formation. He was sleeping quite comfortably too, and possibly because of his power being sealed, he didn&#x2019;t detect Chu Feng and Taikou even though they had come quite near.</span></p><p><span style="">When Chu Feng approached, he carefully examined Qiu Canfeng. Even though two years had passed, Qiu Canfeng was still in quite good shape. His complexion was even more spirited.</span></p><p><span style="">But sadly, due to the barrier of the Four Symbols Binding Formation, Chu Feng could not detect Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s cultivation, even though his Spirit power was quite strong. However, the Four Protectors&#x2019; cultivations should be roughly the same, and since You Mingdeng was a rank four Martial King, Chu Feng assumed Qiu Canfeng was the same realm as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This Four Symbols Binding Formation is very powerful; however, a large portion of its power has been used to seal Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s cultivation. It won&#x2019;t be too difficult to deactivate it. I just need a bit of time&#x2026; Roughly ten days.&#x201D; Taikou was also carefully examining this Four Symbols Binding Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Actually, I have a method of deactivation. I just need your help, and in twenty hours, we should be finished,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Twenty hours?&#x201D; Taikou was taken aback by those words, and a hint of doubt flashed past his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Ten days was the quickest time he predicted, but now Chu Feng had said twenty hours instead. In his perspective, that was nearly impossible.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t say anything concerning his doubt. Instead, he held out his finger, and drew in the air. Very soon, a glowing and shining picture of lines and runes stood upright in the air.</span></p><p><span style="">Taikou&#x2019;s eyes lit up when his gaze landed on that diagram. After a brief moment, he lightly smiled, and said in praise, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you are indeed outstanding. Let&#x2019;s follow your instructions.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
