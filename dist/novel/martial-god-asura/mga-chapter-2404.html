<p><strong> Chapter 2404 - The Primogenitor&#x2019;s Inheritance</strong></p><p>The Grief Calamity Mountain Range was a forbidden area established by a hero-level character of the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>That individual was an important individual who had helped push the Kong Heavenly Clan to the throne of a tier one power.</p><p>Not only did he possess overwhelming battle power and a powerful cultivation, he was also a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>It could be said that there would not be a Kong Heavenly Clan like the one there was today without him.</p><p>When he was alive, he had been one of the most revered existences of his era.</p><p>Although he was not really the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s primogenitor, he was the one who had brought about a rebirth to the Kong Heavenly Clan. Thus, the Kong Heavenly Clan addressed him as the Kong Primogenitor.</p><p>Furthermore, that individual was the widely-accepted strongest senior in the entire history of the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>In the life of that Kong Primogenitor, he had gone through countless tribulations and encountered many chance opportunities.</p><p>He had passed down the treasures and skills that he had acquired in his lifetime, allowing the Kong Heavenly Clan to possess the glory to continue on till this day.</p><p>However, the Kong Primogenitor had not passed down all of the things that he had obtained in his lifetime. He had still left behind a small portion of them.</p><p>As for that small portion, it was hidden in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range by him.</p><p>Furthermore, he had set up grand formations on the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.</p><p>He declared that only the most outstanding individual of the Kong Heavenly Clan would be capable of obtaining all of his inheritance, and that only the person who had obtained all his inheritance would be a descendant that he acknowledged.</p><p>Merely because of that one sentence, countless talented individuals of the Kong Heavenly Clan had set foot into the Grief Calamity Mountain Range over the past few generations.</p><p>However, the results were tragic. For the sake of obtaining all of the Kong Primogenitor&#x2019;s inheritance, for the sake of becoming a descendant that he acknowledged, many of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s talents that could become individuals that would move about unhindered in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and become the pride of their Kong Heavenly Clan ended up losing their lives in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.</p><p>Later on, for the sake of preventing this sort of tragedy from happening nonstop, that generation&#x2019;s Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief entered a discussion with the Utmost Exalted Elders. In the end, they decided to seal off the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, turning it into a forbidden area.</p><p>Unless there was someone from the Kong Heavenly Clan that was capable of reaching the True Immortal realm of cultivation whilst also being a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist&#x2026; no one was allowed to enter the Grief Calamity Mountain Range again.</p><p>The reason for that was because the Grief Calamity Mountain Range was simply akin to being a graveyard of geniuses.</p><p>&#x201C;Three Utmost Exalted Elders, please forgive this junior for speaking forthrightly. The treasures contained in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range are things that only the people of our Kong Heavenly Clan know about. Outsiders should have no clue about the treasures.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yet now, an outsider has actually managed to trespass into it. I ask&#x2026; could it be considered that a traitor has appeared in our Kong Heavenly Clan?&#x201D; A peak Martial Ancestor-level expert asked sternly.</p><p>&#x201C;Naturally, this matter would be spread by someone of our clan. However, it is still not the time to investigate this matter. Rather, we should be more concerned about that reckless intruder,&#x201D; Kong Moyu said.</p><p>&#x201C;The Grief Calamity Mountain Range is extremely dangerous. I believe this is something that everyone here knows about. If one does not enter deeply, they might still be fine. However, should one enter deeply, one will most likely end up dying.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Over the various generations, so many of our Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s talented seniors have attempted to penetrate the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. Yet, only a few of them managed to return alive. I reckon that the intruder will practically have no chance of survival.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, everyone need not be too worried about it. Perhaps we simply do not have to do anything, and that intruder will die in there. We must believe in the power of Lord Primogenitor,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. That is the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, after all. Even the geniuses of our Kong Heavenly Clan do not dare to penetrate deeply into that place, how could an outsider possibly be able to?&#x201D;</p><p>The people from the Kong Heavenly Clan all nodded in agreement at Kong Yuehua&#x2019;s words.</p><p>Most importantly, they all possessed an air of arrogance in their hearts. They felt that no one would be able to accomplish what was impossible for the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;But, according to what the spirit formation is showing, that intruder has been in there for a very long time now. Furthermore, that intruder is still alive. I fear that the intruder&#x2019;s origin is no small matter,&#x201D; Someone said worriedly.</p><p>The reason for that was because whenever someone from the Kong Heavenly Clan attempted to challenge the Grief Calamity Mountain Range in the past, the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan would all use this spirit formation to determine the situation inside the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.</p><p>After entering the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, those that were able to survive for longer were generally always the ones that were more powerful.</p><p>Thus, the Kong Heavenly Clan had recorded all the times that the people that entered the Grief Calamity Mountain Range managed to survive. In fact, their times were taught like textbooks to all the people in the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>If one was to determine the strength of an individual according to that time, then the intruder in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range now would be extremely powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;If we are to determine it according to the time, then yes, that intruder is no small matter,&#x201D; The others from the Kong Heavenly Clan all began to worry.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, you all shouldn&#x2019;t forget about what sort of place the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is. Not only does this place possess a lot of renowned old monsters, there are also many non-famous monsters that have been in closed-door training for a very long time. It would be fine if they did not come out. However, when they do, they will be able to bring forth a rain of blood and gore.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not mentioning the people born of our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, a lot of people from other Ordinary Realms have gathered here over the years, and even the amount of experts from the Lower Realms in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is innumerable.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As the saying goes, there are skies beyond the sky, and people beyond the person. The world of martial cultivators has never lacked true experts. Thus, we cannot look down on anyone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for this intruder, he was able to intrude into the Grief Calamity Mountain Range without being detected at all. This serves to prove how powerful that intruder is.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that Lord Primogenitor had left this spirit formation, we would likely not even have been able to discover that there has been an intruder in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range even after that intruder left.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, we absolutely cannot treat today&#x2019;s matter lightly; we absolutely cannot lower our guard.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;On the contrary, we must treat it very seriously, and make surefire preparations. The reason for that is because this might not only be someone intruding into our forbidden area, it might even be a calamity to our Kong Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said in a very serious manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, is it really that serious?&#x201D; Hearing what Kong Shunlian said, many of the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan started to sweat cold bullets.</p><p>After all, if it was as Kong Shunlian had said, that intruder would not be an unknown nobody, but rather a frightening existence capable of bringing about a rain of blood and gore.</p><p>&#x201C;Shunlian, in that case, what do you think we should do right now?&#x201D; Kong Moyu raised his eyebrows and asked indifferently.</p><p>&#x201C;Since Elder Yuehua is guarding this place, the two of us should guard the entrance to the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If that intruder is able to get out alive, a battle will be unavoidable,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;You want the two of us to go together? Is there really a need for all this?&#x201D; Kong Muyu smiled somewhat disdainfully. Evidently, compared to the seriousness Kong Shunlian possessed, Kong Moyu was filled with contempt toward the unknown intruder.</p><p>&#x201C;Better safe than sorry,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh Shunlian, I must say that you are still the same after all these years, so afraid of everything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, I admit that what you said is correct. There are skies beyond the sky, and people beyond the person. In this world, there are indeed hidden dragons and crouching tigers, and many powers that are much more powerful than our Kong Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, what sort of place is this? This is the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, who could possibly contend against our Kong Heavenly Clan?&#x201D; Kong Moyu said.</p><p>&#x201C;What I am suggesting is just in case. Perhaps that intruder might not even be able to exit the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. Or perhaps that intruder possesses a cultivation below that of True Immortal. However, if that intruder is able to exit the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, and is someone with the cultivation of a True Immortal, what do we do then?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if that intruder is a True Immortal-level expert, he will not be able to leave our Kong Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; Kong Moyu said.</p><p>The two Utmost Exalted Elders argued nonstop. As for Kong Yuehua, she seemed to have already grown accustomed to such a scene. Thus, she did not bother to cut into the argument, nor did she tried to stop them. Instead, she turned her gaze onto that spirit formation, and began to carefully observe it.</p><p>&#x201C;This is bad!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Kong Yuehua revealed an extremely startled expression on her previously calm face.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
