<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1683 - This Is The Truth</strong></p><p>After hearing what Nangong Beidou said, the upper echelons of the Nangong Imperial Clan were all overjoyed.</p><p>They all felt that the Nangong Imperial Clan had obtained a huge success, that the Snow-haired Immortal was afraid of them. That was why she had handed Chu Feng over to them; that was how they had managed to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng died?&#x201D; However, upon hearing what Nangong Beidou said, Nangong Tianlong and his three siblings were all shocked. Their expressions became very unnatural. Then, Nangong Tianhu even asked, &#x201C;Imperial Father, did you kill Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No, Chu Feng has been killed by the Snow-haired Immortal. The Snow-haired Immortal said that Chu Feng was not her disciple at all. Back then, she had only saved Chu Feng because she was interested in him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;On the same day that she saved Chu Feng, she had conducted an experiment on Chu Feng. That experiment of hers failed and Chu Feng died in the process.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We have checked the timing. It turned out that the time of Chu Feng&#x2019;s death declared by the Snow-haired Immortal just so happened to be the time when the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s spirit formation lost track of Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In other words, Chu Feng has really died. The Snow-haired Immortal did not lie to us. Else, how could the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s tracking formation possibly lose its effectiveness?&#x201D; Nangong Beidou said.</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Father, that doesn&#x2019;t add up. That is impossible. You all must have been deceived by the Snow-haired Immortal. Chu Feng is definitely still alive,&#x201D; Nangong Tianhu said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say?&#x201D; After hearing what Nangong Tianhu said, Nangong Beidou, the White-browed Immortal and the others&#x2019; expressions all changed.</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Father, I said that Chu Feng is still alive, that the Snow-haired Immortal is definitely deceiving you all,&#x201D; Nangong Tianhu repeated.</p><p>&#x201C;Tianhu, could it be that you know something?&#x201D; Nangong Beidou asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Father, if it is as the Snow-haired Immortal has said, then Chu Feng should have died over twenty days ago. However, roughly two days ago, the connection between the Purple Rainbow Sword and the Cyan Rainbow Sword were severed from me and third brother.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At the crucial moment when they were severed, the two of us sensed Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura. If Chu Feng is dead, how could we possibly have sensed his aura?&#x201D; Nangong Tianhu said.</p><p>&#x201C;Tianshi, did this happen?&#x201D; Nangong Beidou asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Father, what second brother said is the truth. Big brother and fourth sister were also present at that time,&#x201D; Nangong Tianshi said.</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Father, that is indeed the case. At that time, we four siblings were chatting with one another when second brother and third brother suddenly vomited blood and grew extremely weak in health. It was indeed that the connection between them and their Incomplete Imperial Armaments had been severed,&#x201D; Nangong Tianlong testified.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait a moment, you all are saying that you sensed Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura?&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Immortal, it was indeed Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura. How could we possibly forget Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura?&#x201D; Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi replied together.</p><p>&#x201C;Bullshit!&#x201D; However, upon hearing those words, the White-browed Immortal was suddenly enraged.</p><p>He pointed at Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi and said, &#x201C;That spirit formation of mine is capable of tracking Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura. However, not long after Chu Feng was saved by the Snow-haired Immortal, my tracking formation lost track of Chu Feng. At the same time, Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura completely disappeared.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is only one explanation for that. And that is that Chu Feng is already dead.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When I went to find the Snow-haired Immortal, my intention was not to have her hand over Chu Feng. Merely, I wanted to verify whether Chu Feng was already dead.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The result was the same as I had guessed. Chu Feng had died. Furthermore, the time at which he died was the same as the time that I expected.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yet now, you all are saying that you sensed Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura roughly two days ago? Is this not spouting nonsense? Chu Feng is already dead. Thus, how could you have sensed Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura?&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal was very angry.</p><p>The reason why he was so angry was because he was certain that Chu Feng was dead. Otherwise, his tracking formation would not have been unable to track Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura.</p><p>However, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi declared that they had sensed Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura, and that it was Chu Feng that had severed their connection to the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword. To the White-browed Immortal, their declarations were simply questioning his ability. That was the reason why he had gotten this angry.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother White-brow, don&#x2019;t be so emotional. The way I see it, Tianhu and them don&apos;t seem to be joking around. You had also mentioned before that your tracking formation was only able to track Chu Feng because it was able to lock onto Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Say, do you think that it might be that there&#x2019;s another possibility? Could it be that Chu Feng has not died and has only changed his aura? Could that be the reason why your tracking formation failed to continue tracking Chu Feng?&#x201D; Nangong Beidou asked.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; is indeed possible. Merely, the probability of it happening is extremely small. While one&#x2019;s external aura is easily changed, it is extremely hard to change one&#x2019;s internal aura. At the very least, it is impossible for me to accomplish that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the Snow-haired Immortal, I will admit that she is stronger than me. Among the Ten Immortals, the Snow-haired Immortal is an unconventional person. Even though her world spirit techniques are unconventional, it is true that her world spirit techniques are extremely profound and capable of accomplishing things that would be impossible for others to accomplish.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if you are to tell me that she could change Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura in such a short period of time, I would definitely not believe you,&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, Chu Feng&#x2019;s death must be a fact. Then, the person that should have severed the connection from the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword should be the Snow-haired Immortal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that the Snow-haired Immortal has deceived us still.&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Beidou sighed. The reason for that was because they had also asked the Snow-haired Immortal about the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword in their journey to the Ten Thousand Miles Heavenly Summit.</p><p>However, the Snow-haired Immortal declared that she had not touched any of Chu Feng&#x2019;s possessions. Thus, she simply did not know of any Cyan Rainbow Sword and Purple Rainbow Sword. Furthermore, even if she knew, she would not want them, because she was not interested in them.</p><p>However, right now, the connection the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword had possessed with the two Nangong Clan princes had been severed. This caused Nangong Beidou to feel that it had been done by the Snow-haired Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, the Purple Rainbow Sword and Cyan Rainbow Sword are treasures of our Nangong Imperial Clan. We cannot let them be obtained by the Snow-haired Immortal like this. Should we go and demand them back?&#x201D; The people from the Nangong Imperial Clan asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Demand them back? It would be one thing if it was for the sake of eliminating Chu Feng that we go on that expedition against the Snow-haired Immortal. However, if it&#x2019;s for two Incomplete Imperial Armaments, it is best to forget about it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Snow-haired Immortal is not someone who we can easily trifle with. It is not worth our efforts for us to fight against the Snow-haired Immortal for two Incomplete Imperial Armaments,&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, Immortal, are we to just forget about the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword?&#x201D; Nangong Beidou asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Chief Nangong, I have already said that my true purpose in bringing you all with me to the Ten Thousand Miles Heavenly Summit to meet the Snow-haired Immortal was merely to verify Chu Feng&#x2019;s death, and not to fight against the Snow-haired Immortal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Among the Ten Immortals, the Snow-haired Immortal possesses strength ranked within the top five. As for I, among the Ten Immortals, I am only ranked tenth.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we were to truly go on an expedition against the Snow-haired Immortal, unless you are capable of having Nangong Longjian or your Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s several Utmost Exalted Elders act, with merely our power, we will not necessarily be a match for her.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Think of it carefully. Are you really willing to make such a person an enemy for the sake of two Incomplete Imperial Armaments?&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal asked.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
