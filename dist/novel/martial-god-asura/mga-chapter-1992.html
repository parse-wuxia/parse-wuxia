<p><strong> Chapter 1992 - The End Of The Battle</strong></p><p>Overwhelmed with pain, the World Devastator Immortal roared, &#x201C;Chu Feng, I really should have killed you then, you little bastard!!!!&#x201D; His killing intent was overflowing, and caused even the sky to turn pitch-black. Black clouds surged in the skies like countless savage demons gathered in one place.</p><p>His killing intent was truly terrifying.</p><p>At that moment, many people felt their hair stand on end. They were feeling very uneasy.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not show the slightest bit of fear. With a smile still on his face, he said, &#x201C;Back then, you wanted to kill me. Merely, you didn&#x2019;t dare to do so.&#x201D;</p><p>What Chu Feng said was the truth. Back then, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had personally given the order telling the World Devastator Immortal that he was not allowed to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>Even though the World Devastator Immortal was very strong, he did not have the courage to go against the orders of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>&#x201C;I will definitely kill you! I will definitely kill you!!!&#x201D;</p><p>The World Devastator Immortal roared once more. He truly regretted that he had not killed Chu Feng. If he knew this sort of thing would happen, he would have killed Chu Feng without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p><p>Merely, he also knew that there was no way for him to repeat the past. Even if he regretted his decision, there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#x201D; Overwhelmed with incomparable anger, the World Devastator Immortal turned his face to the sky and shouted.</p><p>This time around, an even stronger power surged from his body.</p><p>In this sort of situation, Lord Luokong did not dare to lower his guard. He closely guarded where Chu Feng stood in fear that the World Devastator Immortal would attack Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Sure enough, after snarling at the sky, the World Devastator Immortal unleashed an extremely frightening explosive power. This was the most frightening power that the World Devastator Immortal had unleashed since fighting against Lord Luokong.</p><p>He had placed all of his power into his speed.</p><p>Merely, he did not fly toward Chu Feng. Instead, he flew in the opposite direction from Chu Feng.</p><p>The World Devastator Immortal was actually escaping. After his son was killed, he knew that he was destined to be defeated. Thus, in the end, he chose to escape.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, remember this! I will absolutely not let you get away with this! Not only you, but all of your relatives, all of your acquaintances, I will kill every single one of them! I will make you regret your actions today for the rest of your life!&#x201D;</p><p>While the World Devastator Immortal had escaped, he had left threatening words. Everyone was able to tell that those words of his didn&#x2019;t seem to be said jokingly.</p><p>&#x201C;You won&#x2019;t escape!&#x201D; Lord Luokong shouted angrily. He started to chase after the World Devastator Immortal. He was not willing to give the World Devastator Immortal the chance to escape.</p><p>Unfortunately, of all the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves present, only Lord Luokong chased after the World Devastator Immortal. After all, only Lord Luokong possessed the strength to fight against the World Devastator Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time to clear up the battlefield,&#x201D; After Lord Luokong left to chase after the World Devastator Immortal, Chu Feng took out his Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader.</p><p>Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd from the Dark Hall started to shiver. They were not afraid when Lord Luokong spoke those sorts of words toward them before. However, when Chu Feng said those words now, they were afraid. The reason for that was because they knew that a great catastrophe was about to befall them.</p><p>Unfortunately, Chu Feng would not spare them just because they were afraid. Holding the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader in his hand, Chu Feng began to ruthlessly massacre the people from the Dark Hall.</p><p>Chu Feng loathed the people from the Dark Hall enormously. He did not understand why these experts would be willing to serve the Dark Hall. However, he knew that these people that were willing to serve the Dark Hall were people that were willing to harm the innocent. As such, they absolutely could not be spared.</p><p>After some time, the people from the Dark Hall and the remaining Ancient Era&#x2019;s ferocious beasts that were with him were all massacred by Chu Feng and the others.</p><p>Finally, those malicious individuals from the Dark Hall paid for their actions with blood.</p><p>Not long after everyone from the Dark Hall was eliminated, Lord Luokong returned. From his appearance, it could be seen that he had not managed to successfully catch up to the World Devastator Immortal.</p><p>In other words, Lord Luokong had not dared to chase after the World Devastator Immortal too far. After all, the Dark Hall possessed an unfathomable strength. If he were to chase too far, he would be worried about the situation on this side. Thus, he had no choice but to give up on chasing after the World Devastator Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, this is all thanks to your prompt arrival. Else, with the situation here today, it would not only have been a disaster. Rather, we would all have been killed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, little friend Chu Feng, please accept this old man&#x2019;s salute,&#x201D; After Lord Luokong returned, he led the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves and bowed to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Luokong, quickly stand up. We are allies. There is no need for you to be this courteous.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, with your seniority, this junior is truly unable to bear you acting in such a way,&#x201D; Chu Feng hurriedly lent Lord Luokong an arm to help him back up.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, this old man also understands that. Merely, if I do not do this, I will feel uneasy in my heart,&#x201D; Lord Luokong said with a smile.</p><p>He had always been an individual that was high and above everyone else. When had he ever bowed this respectfully to someone? Even to His Majesty the Elf King, he would not have to bow due to his seniority. As such, there was no need to mention a member of the younger generation. Yet today, he had bowed to Chu Feng. Furthermore, he had done so in a very undisturbed manner. In fact, he felt better after bowing to Chu Feng.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. There was nothing he could say. After all, he knew that he had indeed indirectly saved the lives of everyone here. Thus, Lord Luokong and the others were grateful to him, and wanted to use this sort of method to express their thanks, as only by doing this would they feel more comfortable.</p><p>Seeing how the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; Lord Luokong had actually led the other Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves to bow respectfully to Chu Feng, Snow Blade Mad Demon and the other experts were shocked. At the same time, they were feeling even more uncomfortable.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had not lied to them. He had really formed an alliance with the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. Else, as one of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; Four Grand Elders, how could Lord Luokong possibly bow to Chu Feng like this?</p><p>Yet, they had actually been skeptical of Chu Feng&#x2019;s claims earlier. As such, they truly felt ashamed of themselves.</p><p>Suddenly, an old man stepped forth and spoke. &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, if you don&#x2019;t mind, I would like to become a nominal elder of the Cyanwood Mountain,&#x201D; This old man was wearing black clothes, and possessed the same level of cultivation as the Snow Blade Mad Demon. He was a rank six Martial Emperor.</p><p>He was also one of the many people that had been skeptical of Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng had saved him. Thus, he was feeling ashamed in his heart, and wanted to use this sort of method to reciprocate with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;If senior is willing, our Cyanwood Mountain will absolutely welcome you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I also wish to become a nominal elder of the Cyanwood Mountain,&#x201D; Following him, all the people that did not belong to any sect or school began to ask if they could also become nominal elders of the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he accepted all of their requests. Firstly, the weakest among them were Martial Emperors. Should they join the Cyanwood Mountain, each and every one of them would be able to increase the overall strength of the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>Next and most importantly, all of these people were people that had fought with Chu Feng. They were people who had killed members of the Dark Hall together with Chu Feng. As such, Chu Feng trusted them.</p><p>In the end, the Snow Blade Mad Demon stood forward and said, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, as this old man has killed that elder of the Heavenly Law Palace, I will not be joining the Cyanwood Mountain.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if little friend Chu Fend needs my assistance in the future, I am available at any time. Remember, little friend Chu Feng, your enemies are also this Snow Blade Mad Demon&#x2019;s enemies.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As long as this old man is still alive, I will absolutely not let anyone make things difficult for you, little friend Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, those words of yours are sufficient for me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile. Even though the Snow Blade Mad Demon had questioned him before, he had discovered that the Snow Blade Mad Demon was a hot-tempered and honest man. As such, Chu Feng possessed an excellent impression of the Snow Blade Mad Demon.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
