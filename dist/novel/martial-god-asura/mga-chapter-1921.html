<p><strong> Chapter 1921 - Eight Banners </strong></p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng said, &#x201C;Let me have a look.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s words, Xian Miaomiao revealed a delighted expression. She was so depressed earlier that she actually forgot that Chu Feng was an extraordinary world spiritist.</p><p>&#x201C;You?&#x201D; However, after Chu Feng spoke, Lil Red revealed a disdainful gaze. Lil Red did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to do anything. After all, it was impossible for even Lil Red.</p><p>&#x201C;The rock walls of this place are extremely solid because they actually possess a very special power. Although that power is not world spirit power, I can attempt to use my world spirit techniques to undo that power,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the power of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers. The more Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers there are, the stronger that power will be. As this place contains a lot of Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers, the power that protects them is also exceptionally strong,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said.</p><p>&#x201C;Leave it to me,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled again. Then, he began to set up his spirit formation. Merely, Chu Feng&#x2019;s action in setting up the spirit formation this time around was somewhat different from the past.</p><p>Before Chu Feng began to actually set up his spirit formation, he took out eight banners from his Cosmos Sack. The eight banners all possessed different colors. However, there were runes and symbols drawn on all eight of them. Contained within those runes and symbols was a special power.</p><p>Chu Feng inserted the eight banners into the ground around him. Then, using his world spirit power as a string, he linked the eight banners to one another.</p><p>Then, he sat down in the center of the eight banners and began to set up his spirit formation.</p><p>Those eight banners were treasures for world spiritists. Chu Feng had obtained them from the possessions of the Avaricious Immortal.</p><p>To be honest, if he didn&#x2019;t have those eight banners, it would have been extremely difficult for Chu Feng to break through the defensive power of this place. However, with the eight banners, Chu Feng possessed an eighty percent certainty in being able to break through it.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s hands began to move rapidly and turned into many blurs. At the same time, boundless world spirit power began to fly out from Chu Feng&#x2019;s body like many golden dragons. The golden dragons then entered the spirit formation that Chu Feng was setting up to form a grand spirit formation. Light began to radiate all around. It was a truly imposing sight to behold.</p><p>&#x201C;Beauty, beauty, what is great sir doing? Are those world spirit techniques? Then, could he be a world spiritist?&#x201D; Lil Red asked Xian Miaomiao curiously. The reason for that was because the spirit formation that Chu Feng was setting up right now was truly shocking to behold.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Chu Feng is a world spiritist. Lil Red, you actually know about world spiritists?&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao looked to Lil Red with a surprised expression. Even though Lil Red, living in this place, was cut off from the rest of the world, it seemed that it knew quite a lot of things.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. We Royal Spirit Insects are always very hardworking and eager to learn. Furthermore, I am the representative of being hardworking and eager to learn. Thus, I don&#x2019;t know about anything. No, no, no, I meant to say I know about everything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am extremely intelligent, extremely powerful,&#x201D; Lil Red raised its little head proudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Break!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng shouted loudly. Then, one of the banners left the spirit formation and, carrying a boundless amount of power, began to fly toward the direction that Chu Feng had pointed at.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>That banner struck the mountain. However, the wall that it struck did not break apart, nor did it explode. Instead, like a spirit, the banner passed through the wall.</p><p>At this moment, one could tell with one&#x2019;s naked eyes that there were layers of power distorting and dissipating within that mountain&#x2019;s wall.</p><p>&#x201C;Break!&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng shouted seven more times in succession. Then, the other seven banners also entered the mountain&#x2019;s wall.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng, who had originally been sitting on the ground, suddenly stood up. As he stood up, the enormous spirit formation that was centered on him actually also rose up alongside him.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s long hair was drifting, and his clothes were fluttering. He appeared to be extremely extraordinary and imposing.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng clasped his palms together and crossed his fingers. With that, his spirit formation actually shrunk in size and entered his body.</p><p>The very next moment, Chu Feng pointed his crossed fingers at the direction where the eight banners had entered.</p><p>&#x201C;Split!&#x201D;</p><p>Once he said that word, a golden light shot out from his fingertips. Like a sharp sword, it pierced into that mountain&#x2019;s wall.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Explosions began to spring up everywhere. Crushed rocks were falling all over the place. That indestructible mountain wall was actually split apart by Chu Feng.</p><p>Not only was that mountain wall split apart by Chu Feng, Chu Feng also broke through the power that was protecting the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers.</p><p>At that moment, the mysterious Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers appeared before Chu Feng, Xian Miaomiao and Lil Red.</p><p>The Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers look like a lump of mist made of silk.</p><p>However, with merely a single glance, Chu Feng could tell that they were an extremely extraordinary sort of Natural Energy.</p><p>Like their names, they were truly quintessential treasures. Looking at the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers, Chu Feng felt a bit of temptation. If he were to be able to refine all of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers here, he might even be able to reach a breakthrough from rank one Martial Emperor to rank two Martial Emperor.</p><p>However, that was merely a thought. Chu Feng would not actually go and refine the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers because these Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers belonged to Xian Miaomiao.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow! Great sir, your world spirit techniques are actually that powerful? You were actually able to even break apart the power of this place?&#x201D; Lil Red&#x2019;s mouth was wide open with shock. Disbelief filled its insect face.</p><p>As for Xian Miaomiao, she jumped into the mountain cave happily and began to carefully pick away at those Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers.</p><p>Chu Feng did not enter. Instead, he watched as Xian Miaomiao harvested the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers that she had longed for day and night.</p><p>Suddenly, Xian Miaomiao stopped harvesting the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers. A distressed expression appeared on her previously smiling face.</p><p>Seeing that Xian Miaomiao&#x2019;s reaction was strange, Chu Feng stepped forward and asked, &#x201C;Miaomiao, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I can only bring away a portion of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers here. The other portion cannot be brought away by me,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao pointed to the several tens of lumps of Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers in the distant.</p><p>&#x201C;Aiya, they have already dissolved in this place. It&#x2019;s truly a pity,&#x201D; Lil Red also ran over.</p><p>Chu Feng also discovered that those Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers had, for some reason, dissolved. To put it in simpler terms, those Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers were already damaged.</p><p>For example, if those Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers were fruits, then the ones that could be brought away would be the fruits that were in good condition. As for the ones that could not be brought away, they were the rotten fruits. At that moment, the ones that were rotten were even more numerous than the ones that were in good condition. It was no wonder Xian Miaomiao would have such a distressed expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Miaomiao, although those Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers have already dissolved, I have a way to gather a portion of their energy so that you can refine them right now,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, is what you said for real?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Xian Miaomiao immediately became overjoyed. It was as if she had seen a light at the end of a dark tunnel.</p><p>&#x201C;Why would I lie to you?&#x201D; Chu Feng was afraid that Xian Miaomiao would not trust him. Thus, he began to set up his spirit formation as he spoke. He wanted to gather the dispersed energy of those Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers so that Xian Miaomiao could refine it.</p><p>&#x201C;But, Chu Feng, there&#x2019;s a lot of Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers here. Even if I am to refine them, it would take me some time. As this place is currently dangerous, are you sure...?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng had begun to set up his spirit formation, Xian Miaomiao was both moved and worried.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s alright. Be at ease, and just start refining them. I will guard this place. I guarantee you that no one will disturb you before you finish refining all of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p><p>Seeing the smile on Chu Feng&#x2019;s face, Xian Miaomiao&#x2019;s face grew stiff. She was moved, and felt a warm feeling running through her heart. However, that warm feeling caused her nose to stuff up slightly.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
