<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 984 - Curing Zi Ling</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, not only have I come, many people who were in the continent of the Nine Provinces&#x2014;even the Jiang Dynasty and the World Spirit Guild&#x2014;have come. They&#x2019;ve all been situated in the Misty Peak. We can live together like we did in the past!&#x201D; Chu Yue&#x2019;s eyes squinted into two crescent moons as she gave a very beautiful smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sister Fuyan, what is going on?&#x201D; Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t celebrate too soon; instead, in his eyes, there was a hint of anxiousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t worry, it&#x2019;s like this&#x2026;&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan seemed to know what Chu Feng was concerned about, so she quickly explained, &#x201C;After Tantai Xue awoke, she immediately left. However, before departing, she told us we can continue living here because it was only an accident that she and Jiang Qisha and the others came to the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t that easy to come to the Eastern Sea Region from that place. Actually, it can be said to be impossible. Moreover, there won&#x2019;t be anyone in the Holy Land of Martialism who will want to come to a place like the Eastern Sea Region because in their eyes, this is no more than a landfill that has nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, no one knows about Jiang Qisha and Tantai Xue coming to the Eastern Sea Region, so there won&#x2019;t be anyone else from the Holy Land of Martialism who&#x2019;ll disturb us.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;After knowing about this, my mother decided to bring all our friends and families to the Misty Peak. Here, we can not only protect them, we can provide even better cultivation conditions. We can even borrow the Misty Peak&#x2019;s power to prolong their lives.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng now understood what had happened. So, his nervous heart was finally at ease. As Qiushui Fuyan said, what he worried was the Cursed Soil Sect&#x2019;s members coming to the Eastern Sea Region. At that time, they will most definitely know Jiang Qisha and the others were killed by him. And judging how the Cursed Soil Sect acted, anyone related to him would meet disaster.</span></p><p><span style="">However, if what Tantai Xue were true&#x2014;the Cursed Soil Sect wouldn&apos;t come to the Eastern Sea Region&#x2014;then everyone was fine. Moreover, as Qiushui Fuyan said, it would most definitely be many times better to have those with quite good relations with him to live in the Misty Peak rather than in the eastern continents.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sister Fuyan, how are they right now?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;With the assistance of your Crippling Night Demon Sect, is it not an easy task to build some floating palaces? Don&#x2019;t worry, everything&#x2019;s been set up well. Senior Qiu Canfeng has also led the Crippling Night Demon Sect to eradicate the remnants of the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans. He&#x2019;s also rebuilt the Crippling Night Demon Sect, and now, they&#x2019;ve returned to their former prosperous era. They&#x2019;ve become the overlord of the Eastern Sea Region once again and their positions are nearly unmovable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even your position of sect head is recognized by all to be more powerful than the former sect head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s because your potential is unlimited. Right now, it&#x2019;s even said that you&#x2019;re the person who&#x2019;s the most promising to become a Martial Emperor,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said with a smile. &#xA0;There was even a hint of pride as she spoke those words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So many things have happened? How long was I asleep for?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve slept for three months and sixteen days,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Three months and sixteen days?! Doesn&#x2019;t that mean the Heavenly Road that leads to the Holy Land of Martialism will open soon?&#x201D; Chu Feng was clearly quite amazed as he had planned to go forth to the Holy Land of Martialism this year whenever the Heavenly Road opened.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah! It will open very soon. You were asleep for so long and we even thought you were going to miss it! But it seems that you don&#x2019;t need to wait another year.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, I have another good news. After you learn of it, you will definitely be very happy.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s smile became even more dazzling, and Chu Yue by her side was the exact same.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What good news?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked after giving the two of them a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Take a guess.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s raised her brows lightly and her smile was even more beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eh&#x2026; I got it.&#x201D; Chu Feng rolled his eyes a bit in a thinking manner before giving them a faint smile, seeming as if he already knew the answer.</span></p><p><span style="">Qiushui Fuyan very rarely played a joke. Yet, right now, not only was she doing exactly that, she was even smiling so beautifully. Chu Feng thus immediately thought of a possibility.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh? Tell me what good news it is. If you&#x2019;re right, you&#x2019;ll get a prize!&#x201D; When she saw Chu Feng&#x2019;s face of confidence, Qiushui Fuyan was instead a bit suspicious as she questioned him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I&#x2019;m not mistaken, Senior Huangfu Haoyue must have recovered his memories,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens, you truly did get it right!&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s face changed after hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s response. There was a hint of surprise on her smiling complexion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That means Senior Huangfu Haoyue has truly recovered his memories! Has he said anything about my ancestry?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng was also elated. Although he was confident with his answer, he was still quite ecstatic when Qiushui Fuyan gave him the confirmation. Huangfu Haoyue&#x2019;s memories were really too important to Chu Feng. This related to where he came from.</span></p><p><span style="">*rumble rumble rumble rumble&#x2014;*</span></p><p><span style="">But just at that moment, rumbles came from the outside. Simultaneously, the white sky instantly turned pitch-black. Quickly after, purple layers of light flashed outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;s succeeded.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan didn&#x2019;t hold a hint of worry when she saw that. Instead, she looked at Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, quick, let&#x2019;s go out and see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Qiushui Fuyan first flew out and arrived at the entrance to the Misty Peak, heading outside. As for Chu Feng, he quickly followed her.</span></p><p><span style="">Only after coming outside did Chu Feng discover there were indeed several floating palaces built. They were not gorgeous, but they exuded a natural and essential feeling. It went quite well with the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">However, right now, what grabbed Chu Feng&#x2019;s attention the most was a single exquisite floating tower. There were many layers of people surrounding its exterior, and of those people, many were familiar faces.</span></p><p><span style="">Su Ruo, Su Mei, Jiang Wushang, Zhang Tianyi&#x2026; nearly everyone Chu Feng knew was below the floating tower.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, the crowd&#x2019;s gazes were fixed on it. Moreover, there were expressions of surprise, admiration, and joy brimming from their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">At that very instant, the powerful strength emanating from the floating tower affected the world itself. The bright day turned into endless night.</span></p><p><span style="">The layers of purple glows also came from the floating tower. It was being unceasingly emitted and nearly filled the entire sky. Amidst that blinding and beautiful purple glow, one could faintly see something&#x2014;a huge bell.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Zi Ling cursed herself of the Heaven Gripping Pellet?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">There was also an indescribable excitement surging within Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. This was a phenomenon. Very clearly, the person who initiated this was Zi Ling. The Divine Body that had been sealed from birth was now, finally, unsealed.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
