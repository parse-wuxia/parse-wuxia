<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 868 - Skinned Alive and Tendons Extracted</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The glorious head of the Stone Sword Sect only possesses this level of strength?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a mocking smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; The sect head&#x2019;s mouth twitched when heard those words. His face was distorted, and he couldn&#x2019;t help but cast his gaze towards the people at the peak of the palace.</span></p><p><span style="">After he saw them gazing towards him with raised heads, he frowned even tighter.</span></p><p><span style="">He was truly in a difficult situation. On one hand, he discovered that Chu Feng was too terrifying. He seemed to be many times stronger in comparison to the day they clashed before. He really didn&#x2019;t want to continue fighting him because he knew Chu Feng was a freak.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, everyone thought Chu Feng was no match for him. They were looking forward to Chu Feng&#x2019;s death, and for a great display of might.</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, it was truly like he was riding a tiger and couldn&#x2019;t get off. Despite the uneasiness in his heart, he had no retreat. Thus, he could only continue fighting Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh* As he had no choice, the head of the Stone Sword Sect could only make his move again. With the flip of his palm, a stone sword&#x2014;a unique symbol of the Stone Sword Sect&#x2014;appeared in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">When it appeared, light swirled around it. The head of the Stone Sword Sect was using his full strength to channel his power into the stone sword.</span></p><p><span style="">He was not only channeling his own Martial power into it. All of the nearby Martial power was gathering towards the stone sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Due to that, the runes on the sword not only shone brightly, it even rocked to and fro. It endlessly trembled like a furious beast impatient to rid itself of its shackles to tear the enemy before it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This power&#x2026; Could it be the strongest technique in the Stone Sword Sect, Stone Sword Execution?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right! It&#x2019;s Stone Sword Execution! I&#x2019;ve heard if it&#x2019;s mastered, it&#x2019;s even superior to a rank nine martial skill!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Today, we can finally see Sect Head Shi use this technique! It&#x2019;s extremely fierce, so I would quite like to see how that monster Chu Feng will stop it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When they saw such a scene, the crowd cried out in surprise. They were dumbstruck by the power emanated by the stone sword.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard their discussions, the head of the Stone Sword Sect looked even prouder. He shouted, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you have been audacious! First you killed my elders, then you come to my sect to challenge me! Today, with this stone sword, I will take your filthy life!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, the head of the Stone Sword Sect released his hand. The stone sword swirling with radiance flew down, and with such a horrifying aura, pressed its way towards Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">That stone sword was an accumulation of nearly all his Martial power. Its power was truly terrifying. Before it was even near Chu Feng, the ground he stood on cracked. The plaza already filled with holes was bearing an enormous pressure. It was now collapsing.</span></p><p><span style="">But even so, Chu Feng remained unmoving. His hands were behind his back, he looked at the sky, and brought a smile to his face. He was not planning to dodge at all.</span></p><p><span style="">Only when the stone sword was about to collide into him did Chu Feng slowly raise his hand, and opened up his five fingers towards the stone sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is he doing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The crowd was puzzled by Chu Feng&#x2019;s action at first, but after the stone sword had reached Chu Feng, they were terrified so much their heads went numb. Chills went down their spines. Everyone&#x2019;s expression changed greatly.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng not only stopped the stone sword with the power of a single hand, and thus stopped this horrifying Stone Sword Execution, with the clench of his sword, and a huge explosion, he shattered the stone sword.</span></p><p><span style="">The technique named as the sect head&#x2019;s most terrifying strike was turned into dust by just one of Chu Feng&#x2019;s palms. That strength truly surpassed all of their imagination. None of them could accept such a fact.</span></p><p><span style="">But that wasn&#x2019;t even much. After shattering the stone sword, Chu Feng looked at the head of the Stone Sword Sect in the sky and coldly shouted, &#x201C;Old bastard, your life is finished today. Get the hell down here and receive death.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, an insane suction power surged out of his palm, instantly enveloping the head of the Stone Sword Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before such suction power, the head of the Stone Sword Sect cried out in alarm. Not only did he lose his ability to fly, he was even like a kite with its string cut as he lost balance, swayed left and right in the air, and rolled around as he shot straight in Chu Feng&#x2019;s direction.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! The difference in their strength is this big?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is this the Sect Head Shi who beat up Chu Feng, forcing him to escape? He doesn&#x2019;t even stand a chance against Chu Feng!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is unbelievable. This is truly unbelievable. This Chu Feng is even stronger than the rumours.&#x201D; Everyone was tongue-tied and dumbfounded when they saw that. Discussions arose as they shouted in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">Even though they already knew Chu Feng possessed very powerful strength, they didn&#x2019;t think he was </span><i><span style="">that </span></i><span style="">powerful. After they saw Shi Jingtian chase after the panicking and escaping Chu Feng before, they naturally felt Chu Feng was now no match for the sect head either.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet, when they saw this scene, they were truly taken aback. They couldn&#x2019;t help but look at Chu Feng in another light because how could the sect head even chase after Chu Feng? He simply didn&#x2019;t even have any strength to fight against Chu Feng!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lord Yan, save me!&#x201D; In a situation like that, the head of the Stone Sword Sect knew how poor the present circumstances were. So, he quickly asked for help from that Lord Yan.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh* In reality, Lord Yan had already made his move. He waved his big sleeve and the aura of a rank eight Martial Lord burst out. A powerful suction power surged from his sleeve, wrapping around the sect head in the air. He wanted to save him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This brat&#x2026;&#x201D; However, it was useless. Even though his suction power had enveloped the head of the Stone Sword Sect, it was unable to save him.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, he could only watch as the sect head landed into Chu Feng&#x2019;s hands and was grabbed by the neck.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Old bastard, you have been audacious! You dare attack members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect?! Right now, I shall skin you alive, and extract your tendons!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After grabbing hold of the sect head, Chu Feng did not spare him anything. Back then, Shi Jingtian had killed the Nine-fingered Old Man&#x2019;s family and aimed to kill Chu Feng. The fury of him wounding Eggy surged into his head.</span></p><p><span style="">With anger overwhelming his heart, Chu Feng&#x2019;s next moves were merciless. Grabbing his neck, he flung him around like a sandbag. Only after swirling him a few times in the air did he slam down abruptly. With a bang, he was thrown into a deep pit underneath his feet.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng truly put too much force into that slam, so much that the deep pit was unable to bear his strength. The head of the Stone Sword Sect actually shot straight into the ground like a sharp arrow, and one could only hear his heart-wrenching scream.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Get the hell back here.&#x201D; But how would Chu Feng let him go so easily? He grabbed out at the pit, and the head of the Stone Sword Sect returned to his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that moment, not only was blood all over him, his body even made creaking sounds&#x2014;it was the sound of shattered bones. Chu Feng&#x2019;s strike had nearly completely destroyed the sect head&#x2019;s physical body. Not only his bones were destroyed, nearly all his organs were broken.</span></p><p><span style="">But clearly Chu Feng was not satisfied. He extended his palm, and like a sharp blade, it stabbed into the sect head&#x2019;s arm. Then, after pulling it back out, there was a blood thing within his hand&#x2014;the tendon of Shi Jingtian&#x2019;s arm. At that instant, it was forcibly extracted by Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;AHH&#x2014;&#x201D; The pain was unendurable. Shi Jingtian screamed even more painfully than before.</span></p><p><span style="">But that wasn&#x2019;t even much. After Chu Feng pulled out one of his tendons, he extended his hand, and pulled. With a tearing sound, Chu Feng had torn off the skin of Shi Jingtian&#x2019;s entire face.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
