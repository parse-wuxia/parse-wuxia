<p><strong> Chapter 2470 - Returning To The Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Fuck! What is this old man trying to do? He couldn&#x2019;t possibly be thinking of having you renounce the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I had originally thought that he was different from the others. Turns out, he&#x2019;s the most shameless of them all,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen spoke in a very disgusted manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Eggy, don&#x2019;t think of such a thing. I don&#x2019;t think this senior is such an individual,&#x201D; Chu Feng started to calm Eggy. Then, with a very polite tone, he said to Zhan Yuanmo, &#x201C;Senior, please speak.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, Young Hero Chu Feng, I will speak frankly. Both the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe are our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s secret skills that have been passed on for many generations.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although they have chosen you, it remains that they belong to our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If in the future, when you no longer need the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe anymore, I hope that&#x2026; you will not pass them on to others, and instead pass them on to the descendants of our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan,&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo said.</p><p>It turned out that Zhan Yuanmo was not planning to demand the secret skills right away. Instead, he approved of Chu Feng obtaining the two great secret skills.</p><p>He merely wanted Chu Feng to return them to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan if he no longer needed them in the future.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. This Chu Feng will definitely do that,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you for your trouble,&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to it, Zhan Yuanmo revealed a smile of ease.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng began to chat with Zhan Yuanmo and the others about many things. Once they began, they chatted for an entire night.</p><p>When the second day arrived, Chu Feng began to bid his farewells to the crowd.</p><p>As Chu Feng did not belong there, he would naturally not stay there forever. He would have to return to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm soon.</p><p>As for the people of the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain, they could not find any reason to stop Chu Feng from leaving either. Merely&#x2026;.</p><p>When their ancestor created the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain, he had sealed it off. That was also the reason why the people of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan and the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan had been trapped there the entire time.</p><p>Although Chu Feng had already revealed his extraordinary talent and made the people of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan feel full admiration and adoration for him, they were still unable to determine whether or not Chu Feng would be able to leave the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain.</p><p>Only Chu Feng was filled with confidence in himself. Since he was able to come in, he felt that he would definitely be able to leave.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng and the people from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan all arrived at the place where Chu Feng had fallen when he had arrived in the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain, the place where Chu Feng had first encountered Zhan Lingtong.</p><p>&#x201C;Lingtong, I will be leaving. In the future&#x2026; if you ever decide to try leaving this place, you must choose this location,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Zhan Lingtong.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, you mean to say that this place is the weakest location in the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain?&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong asked.</p><p>&#x201C;No, this is not the weakest place. If the space above the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain is a fort, then the space above here is a gate.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unless one possesses overwhelming power capable of cutting through the barrier sealing this place&#x2026; this would be the only place where one can go out from,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Zhan Lingtong.</p><p>As Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques grew stronger, his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes had also grown stronger. In the beginning, he was unable to see the spirit formation above that place. However at that moment, he was able to faintly see it. Furthermore, he had managed to find the exit to that spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder. No wonder our clan&#x2019;s clansmen were simply unable to leave,&#x201D; Hearing those words, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen all came to a sudden realization.</p><p>&#x201C;That said, even with that being the case, one will not be able to leave without sufficient cultivation,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, big brother Chu Feng, what level of cultivation must one need in order to exit?&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong hurriedly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Their cultivation must be at least that of a Martial Ancestor. However, one&#x2019;s talent is also related to this. Thus, it is very hard to judge.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That said, Lingtong, I will advise you of this: the world outside is much more dangerous than here. Unless you feel that the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain is truly unable to contain you any longer, it would be best for you to continue to stay here with your clansmen,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Zhan Lingtong.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that Zhan Lingtong was a very good child. However, both his temperament and his current strength were unsuited for the world outside.</p><p>&#x201C;I got it, big brother Chu Feng. After hearing about the outside world from you, I actually also feel that staying in the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain with my family is pretty good.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That said, big brother Chu Feng, you must take care of yourself. If possible, please come back to visit us frequently,&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong said to Chu Feng. Reluctance filled his eyes as he looked at Chu Feng.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was not merely a friend to him, he was also his idol.</p><p>&#x201C;If possible, I will definitely return to visit everyone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, take care,&#x201D; Chu Feng clasped his fist at the crowd.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng stepped forth and soared into the air. Like a water dragon leaving the sea, he shot straight toward the sky.</p><p>At that moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were all closely watching Chu Feng with fixed gazes.</p><p>Contained in their eyes were worry, doubt and reluctance to part.</p><p>Although Chu Feng possessed outstanding talent, they were still unable to be certain as to whether or not Chu Feng would be able to leave the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain.</p><p>After all, this was a grand formation set up by their ancestor.</p><p>However, Chu Feng soon disappeared. It was not that Chu Feng had flown beyond the crowd&#x2019;s line of sight, but rather that he had truly disappeared. It was as if he had entered another world.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Hero Chu Feng seems to have succeeded,&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo said.</p><p>At that moment, the majority of the people were all thinking of the same thing as Zhan Yuanmo; they all felt that Chu Feng had succeeded.</p><p>However, upon ascertaining that Chu Feng had successfully left, they started to feel a sense of loss.</p><p>As for the reason why, they each had their respective reasons.</p><p>Some people felt that Chu Feng&#x2019;s existence would bring about change to the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain, that Chu Feng leaving would cause the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain to have a lot less joy.</p><p>There were also people that were purely reluctant to part with Chu Feng. Examples of such would be the siblings Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling.</p><p>Of course, there were also a lot of people who were reluctant to part with their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s secret skills.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had really left...</p><p>Chu Feng was currently in another world.</p><p>He was floating in midair. Below him was a vast plain. That vast plain was very desolate and uninhabited. There was not even a single plant to be seen.</p><p>Chu Feng descended from the sky and stood on the plain. He was unable to discover anything extraordinary regarding that place.</p><p>Even when he activated his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, Chu Feng was unable to find anything extraordinary.</p><p>However, Chu Feng knew that he had truly left the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain, and returned to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>&#x201C;That Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s senior was truly extraordinarily powerful. If I hadn&#x2019;t experienced it myself, I truly would never have believed a War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain was hidden above this vast plain,&#x201D; Chu Feng gasped with admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop being so moved about the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain. What you need to make sure of right now is the current situation in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. Although two years is not long, it is not short either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To some people, they will not be able to make any progress in cultivation in two years&#x2019; time. Thus, a period of two years is simply of no significance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, to other people, they are able to accomplish a lot in two years&#x2019; time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Among the latter are Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. I wonder what their cultivations are now,&#x201D; Chu Feng exclaimed.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not like you. Shouldn&#x2019;t you worry about your two friends&#x2019; safety? Why are you instead worried about their cultivation?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said in a very astonished manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Although I have completely offended the Kong Heavenly Clan, and Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong will definitely be implicated by it, I trust them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The two of them are not fools. They will definitely be able to protect themselves,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. However, shouldn&#x2019;t you be worrying about the situation of the Kong Heavenly Clan then?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back then, those bastards of the Kong Heavenly Clan treated you very badly. They are simply too excessive. Although you nearly exterminated them all by borrowing the strength of the Evil God Sword, it remains something that the Evil God Sword did, and not you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I feel that you should go and personally teach them a lesson. You should let them know that you, Chu Feng, are not that easily bullied,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, I must settle the debt with the Kong Heavenly Clan. However, we can place this matter to the side for now. I must first find Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze suddenly shifted. He immediately turned around and looked behind him.</p><p>At that moment, there was no motion in the direction that Chu Feng looked. However, Chu Feng was able to see something completely different.</p><p>There was a large group of people majestically rushing toward his location.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
