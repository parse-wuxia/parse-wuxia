<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1771 - Bring You All In</strong></p><p>This item was fiery red in color, and looked like a fruit. However, it was most definitely no ordinary fruit. Not only did this fruit burn with flames, it was also emitting a special sort of energy that pounded against the people present.</p><p>Chu Feng had managed to tell that this was a type of cultivation resource. However, it was not a simple cultivation resource. Instead, it was a special sort of cultivation resource made especially for the people of the Yan Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Yan Xie, when you said the official start, did you mean the competition between the final twenty individuals and Emperor Gong&#x2019;s successor?&#x201D; Big Radish asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Precisely,&#x201D; Yan Xie nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;But, even if it&#x2019;s the final match, if we are to judge the time starting from now, there wouldn&#x2019;t be much time either. Will you really be able to reach a breakthrough with only that item?&#x201D; Big Radish asked with an expression of shock. Little Radish also revealed the same expression. Even Chili Pepper&#x2019;s eyes were flickering slightly. She too was displaying an expression of disbelief.</p><p>They did not possess the sensitivity that Chu Feng did. Thus, although they could tell that the fiery fruit in Yan Xie&#x2019;s hand was very powerful, they could not sense the special energy contained within it.</p><p>Furthermore, to people like them, reaching a breakthrough was an extremely difficult thing to accomplish. Not only did they have to gather sufficient martial power in their dantians, they also had to use their hearts and minds to communicate with heaven and earth. Through the combination of the knowledge of their predecessors and their own special comprehension ability, they would try to comprehend that turning point that allowed them to reach a breakthrough. Only by reaching a comprehension of a completely new sort of power could they attempt to break through.</p><p>However, even if they managed to comprehend the turning point, comprehend the new power and connect with the new martial power, it was still not certain that they would reach a breakthrough.</p><p>Thus, even if they possessed the ability to reach a breakthrough, to successfully reach a breakthrough would require a lot of time. Generally, the best method to attain a breakthrough would be through closed-door training.</p><p>However, closed-door training was extremely time-consuming. For some people, after they reached the Martial King realm, they would not be able to attain any progress in their entire lives. Even after spending their entire lives meticulously trying to reach a breakthrough, they would still not be able to do so. From this, it could be seen how difficult the path of martial cultivation was.</p><p>When even the Martial King realm was like this, there was less of a need to mention how difficult the Half Martial Emperor realm would be. Thus&#x2026; they did not believe that Yan Xie would be able to reach a breakthrough before the competition began.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a cultivation treasure left behind by the Lord Flame Emperor for our Yan Clan. When the people of our Yan Clan use it to train, we will be able to obtain boundless benefits,&#x201D; Yan Xie explained.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s actually such a wondrous item? The Flame Emperor was truly amazing,&#x201D; Upon hearing those words, Big Radish, Small Radish and Chili Pepper all revealed expressions of envy and admiration on their faces.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng nodded slightly. What Yan Xie had said was not false. Indeed, this was a cultivation treasure. However, this treasure was not something that only the people from the Yan Clan could use. Anyone who trained in the Yan Clan&#x2019;s martial techniques would be able to use it.</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, this is the last one,&#x201D; As Yan Xie looked to the fiery red fruit, he had an expression of reluctance on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;I can help you with your cultivation. There&#x2019;s no need to wait that many days. You should be able to reach a breakthrough by tomorrow morning,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re kidding!&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish all opened their mouths wide in shock.</p><p>One could help another with their cultivation?</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;re serious?&#x201D; At this moment, even Yan Xie found this to be unbelievable.</p><p>&#x201C;I can give it a try,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile. Even he did not dare to guarantee this sort of thing.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, let&#x2019;s try it out right away,&#x201D; Yan Xie said impatiently.</p><p>&#x201C;Here? You two are planning to enter closed-door training here?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish were extremely shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; As for Chu Feng, he nodded while smiling lightly.</p><p>Afterward, Chu Feng and Yan Xie entered a room together. As for Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish, they were extremely nervous as they attentively watched the situation outside, keeping an eye on what the people outside were doing. They deeply feared that someone would come and destroy this world spirit building.</p><p>What people who entered closed-door training feared the most was being disturbed. This was especially true during the crucial moment when they were attacking the barrier to reach a breakthrough. If one were to be disturbed during that time, one could suffer consequences. For light consequences, one might fail to reach a breakthrough. For serious consequences, one&#x2019;s dantian may be damaged, and they would not be able to reach a breakthrough again in their entire lives.</p><p>Yet, Chu Feng had said that he wanted to help Yan Xie reach a breakthrough in a short period of a couple hours?</p><p>Was this truly possible?</p><p>Would he be able to succeed?</p><p>Slowly, time began to pass. A glimmer had appeared on the eastern horizon. Although it had only been a short few hours, to Chili Pepper and the others, it was as if several years had passed. The three of them were extremely nervous.</p><p>Not only were they worried that Yan Xie might fail to reach a breakthrough, they were also worried that Yan Xie and Chu Feng would be adversely affected because of the failure.</p><p>&#x201C;Ta, ta, ta~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, they heard footsteps. Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish immediately stood up and turned their deeply concerned gazes toward the direction where the footsteps were coming from.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng and Yan Xie were walking out of the room together. Compared to when they had gone into the room, there was no change to Chu Feng at all.</p><p>However, when they turned their gazes to Yan Xie, they discovered that he had a rosy complexion, and his aura was already no longer that of a rank five Half Martial Emperor. Instead, he had become a rank six Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;You two actually succeeded?!!!&#x201D; Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish all had their mouths wide open in shock. Contained within their eyes were expressions of being pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Whilst they had considered the possibility of success, they had not expected them to succeed this smoothly.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve always known that Brother Chu Feng was very powerful. However, it is only today that I realized that I have underestimated him the entire time,&#x201D; Yan Xie smiled in an embarrassed manner. However, on his face was an unconcealable joy.</p><p>No matter how he had calculated the possibility of successfully reaching a breakthrough within a certain period of time, they were only calculations. For him to be able to successfully reach a breakthrough now, an enormous weight on his heart had been lifted.</p><p>He had finally obtained the qualifications to stand off against his fellow members of the younger generation. Naturally, Yan Xie would be extremely happy.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing, you two are truly too amazing. Although we&#x2019;re all part of the younger generation, I have discovered that we, when compared to you two, are simply people from two different worlds. Likely, our concept of martial cultivation is absolutely different too,&#x201D; Big Radish said with an expression of feeling inferior. In his eyes was a boundless amount of envy and admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, big brother Yan Xie, that sealed entrance is about to open. The two of you must definitely try your best to obtain a position among the twenty,&#x201D; Little Radish said as he looked toward the outside.</p><p>&#x201C;Stinky brat, what are you saying? With Brother Chu Feng and Brother Yan Xie&#x2019;s cultivations, how could they not be able to obtain two of the twenty positions?&#x201D; Big Radish smacked Little Radish on the head lightly.</p><p>Then, he looked to Chu Feng and Yan Xie and said, &#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, Brother Yan Xie, I wish you two a a safe journey. I hope that you will be able to obtain the best performance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although I am a disciple of the Underworld Palace, I really hope that you two will be able to obtain first place and second place in this Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly,&#x201D; After Big Radish finished saying those words, he solemnly clasped his fist to Chu Feng and Yan Xie.</p><p>&#x201C;Is there even a need for your hope? Chu Feng is a rank seven Half Martial Emperor. He is able to look down on all those outstanding heros. There is already no need to doubt that he&#x2019;ll obtain the title of the Strongest Younger Generation,&#x201D; Chili Pepper curled her lips.</p><p>&#x201C;Right, right right. What you say is correct,&#x201D; Big Radish and Little Radish did not dare to oppose Chili Pepper.</p><p>&#x201C;Based on what you three said, it seems that you&#x2019;re not planning to enter?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, with our strength, even if we were to enter, it would be a waste. Furthermore, there are layers upon layers of danger in there. We will not take this risk,&#x201D; Big Radish said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. We only came here to accompany senior sister Chili Pepper to find big brother Chu Feng. Now that we&#x2019;ve not only seen you, but also became your friends, senior sister Chili Pepper&#x2019;s cherished desire has already been accomplished, and our cherished desires have also been accomplished,&#x201D; Little Radish said.</p><p>At this moment, Chili Pepper was smiling sweetly. While she didn&#x2019;t say anything, she had already confirmed what Big Radish and Little Radish said.</p><p>&#x201C;However, to say the truth, if I can enter the center of this fort and watch the battle between the top geniuses of the Holy Land of Martialism, I would have no regrets in my life,&#x201D; Big Radish gasped.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. All the elders say that the geniuses of this battle will all become the most powerful existences in the Holy Land of Martialism in the future,&#x201D; Little Radish also had an expression of yearning on his face.</p><p>After hearing what Big Radish and Little Radish said, Chili Pepper took a glance at Chu Feng and then began to smile as her imagination began to run freely.</p><p>&#x201C;If you all wish to see the battles, I have a method,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What method?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the three of them asked simultaneously.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll bring you three in,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish were all shocked.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
