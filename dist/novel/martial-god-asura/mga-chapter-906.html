<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 906 - Formation of Multitudinous Talismanic Soldiers</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Indeed, I cannot break through this Immortal Sword Formation. However, this friend from the Holy Land of Martialism does have a plan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Am I right, my friend Jiang Qisha?&#x201D; Murong Mingtian smiled as he turned around, casting his gaze towards the handsome young man whose body was covered with talismans.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Murong Mingtian, remember what you guaranteed me. If you dare to go back on your word, I will let you know what true destruction is.&#x201D; Jiang Qisha indifferently looked at Murong Mingtian. There was not the slightest bit of respect in his eyes, and instead, there was a hint of disdain.</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, disregarding the crowd&#x2019;s expressions, he went straight past Murong Mingtian, towards the very front of the army.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Murong Niekong&#x2019;s and the others&#x2019; faces were not all that well. There was actually someone who dared to speak to his ancestor like that, and, as the younger generation, it was truly unbearable to see such disrespect.</span></p><p><span style="">However, with Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s indication, no one dared to say anything. After all, they knew very well the origin of this young man called Jiang Qisha. Putting aside his strength, his status alone brought forth fear from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng furrowed his brows upon seeing Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s preparations to break through the formation. His greatest fear was the interference from those of the Holy Land of Martialism. Now, it seemed that his fear came true.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuyan, this is the person you said came from the Holy Land of Martialism, right?&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao asked Qiushui Fuyan, who was behind her. Clearly, she too had noticed that this Jiang Qisha was not simple at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;His clothes are indeed the same as the person I saw back then, but he is even stronger than those two. I truly don&#x2019;t know how many people have come from the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan also frowned. Her greatest fear was also an alliance between the people from Holy Land of Martialism and the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not afraid of Murong Mingtian, nor am I afraid of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, but I have to be on guard against this person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Misty Peak originates from the Ancient Era. As the guardian of this place, although I do not have a total grasp on everything, I do know there are treasures that others do not know hidden here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If the person from the Holy Land of Martialism interferes, I&#x2019;m afraid I won&#x2019;t be able to hold this place.&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s face was serious. Her fierce gaze was locked tightly onto that Jiang Qisha.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, he was standing at the forefront of the army. He held a one-meter-long old book. It was very thick, and no one knew what was recorded within. Jiang Qisha was reading through it with no hurry, ignoring the gazes of the crowd. He truly put no one in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Piaomiao, that&#x2026;&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan also started getting nervous. In the moment of anxiousness, she grabbed Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m just worried about the people from the Holy Land of Martialism. After all, that&#x2019;s an unfathomable land. There are many experts there, and if some have truly come here, then we can&#x2019;t really deal with them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, if it&#x2019;s just this little one who wants to break through my Misty Peak&#x2019;s Immortal Sword Formation, then he&#x2019;s truly overestimating himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, even if this formation is truly broken through, I won&#x2019;t stubbornly defend to the end. After all, I still have all you with me. If I can&#x2019;t hold this place, then I will do everything I can to slaughter a path out of this place.&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s words were spoken very calmly. One could tell she was already prepared.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they could also tell she was not absolutely confident she could stop Murong Mingtian and the others.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that moment, Jiang Qisha closed his eyes, and his flipping speed through the book suddenly sped up. The pages on the book were run through as if there were a gale, and at the same time, a very peculiar aura spread from that ancient book.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* The book shone with brilliance, as if it were day. It was so blinding the people nearby could not even open their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Release!&#x201D; Quickly after, Jiang Qisha shouted, and after a boom, the book in his hand transformed into an enormous door over a thousand meters tall.</span></p><p><span style="">This was truly an enormous door. It touched the clouds, and dipped into the sea. As it stood upright in the air, it was like a ladder that connected the heaven and the earth.</span></p><p><span style="">Its shape was very odd as well&#x2014;it was the same as Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s clothing. Strange talismans were stuck all over it, giving others an extremely eerie feeling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, with the exception of Martial Kings, channel the power of your life&#x2019;s root into this door,&#x201D; Jiang Qisha said.</span></p><p><span style="">But after he spoke, the tens of millions of people all looked at each other, not a single one following his order. The power of one&#x2019;s life&#x2019;s root was no joke. That did not only affect cultivation, it affected Source Energy as well. If not done well, there was a possibility of death. Who would so easily channel such power into something else? Especially so for such an odd-looking formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, I&#x2019;ve brought you here not truly to put your life on the line against the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve seen the Immortal Sword Formation as well. If we force an attack, it&#x2019;s likely we won&#x2019;t succeed regardless of our numbers. In the end, it would be no more than a suicidal action.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But, while knowing this, I&#x2019;ve called you here today. Naturally, it&#x2019;s because I need you. At this moment, it is time that I require your power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, everyone, don&#x2019;t hesitate and put forth the power of your life&#x2019;s root. Don&#x2019;t worry, I, Murong Mingtian, swear with my honour that this formation only requires your power to activate. It will not affect your cultivation, nor take your life,&#x201D; Murong Mingtian said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We listen to Ancestor&#x2019;s order!&#x201D; The Immortal Execution Archipelago first responded, then without any more hesitation, all of them channeled their power into the odd door.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh* Quickly after, the army from the Three Great Monstrous Clans also, with the indication of the three chiefs, channeled their own power.</span></p><p><span style="">Layers upon layers of formless but strong power started merging into the door filled with runes. When such a thing occurred, the countless talismans stuck on the door started shining with faint radiance. Moreover, they shone brighter and brighter, and the runes on the talismans even started to squirm, as if they had received life.</span></p><p><span style="">Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s closed eyes burst open when the talismans on the door started to tremble intensely. He shouted, &#x201C;Formation of Multitudinous Talismanic Soldiers, activate!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*aooo&#x2014;* After his words, a peculiar howl exploded within the door. Quickly after, a figure shot out.</span></p><p><span style="">That figure was over three meters tall. It was in the shape of both a human and beast. It held a spear, and its aura was very powerful&#x2014;it was a peak Martial Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">*aooooo&#x2014;* Quickly after, several more howls rang out. The runes on the huge door unceasingly changed, and tens of thousands of figures continually shot out. No matter shape or strength, it was the exact same as the monster before.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, when the door returned to tranquility, nearly everyone who saw the scene before their eyes couldn&#x2019;t help deeply inhaling. At that very instant, the number of powerful monsters standing before the door reached several tens of millions.</span></p><p><span style="">Several tens of millions of peak Martial Lords. That number was truly terrifying!</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
