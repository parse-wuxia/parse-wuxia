<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 881 - Good Show</strong></p><p><span style="">The land where the Ancient Adamantium Ores were dug up was called the Gale Plains. Since there was a mining area from the Ancient Era within the Gale Plains, it was one of the most important territories of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. It was said the one who oversaw this area was the Sixth Immortal of the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s Nine Immortals.</span></p><p><span style="">The Sixth Immortal was the same as the Seventh and Eighth Immortal&#x2014;he was also a rank one Martial King. However, his fighting strength far surpassed those two. It was said with his strength, he could even put up a fight against a rank two Martial King.</span></p><p><span style="">That meant even though the Sixth Immortal was a rank one Martial King, due to his power, the Crippling Night Demon Sect was not going to directly attack the Gale Plains just to avoid any unexpected situations.</span></p><p><span style="">And since the Crippling Night Demon Sect also wanted to get their hands on the Ancient Adamantium Ores, they were most likely going to ambush Murong Xun and the others when they left the Gale Plains with the cargo. Not only would they obtain the ores, they would even be able to capture Murong Xun. That was truly hitting two birds with one stone. Yet, how could they possibly know a huge trap was what awaited them?</span></p><p><span style="">However, after Chu Feng and Qiushui Fuyan left the Teleportation Array and arrived at a potential ambush location, they received very bad news: several days ago, Murong Xun had already led the Immortal Execution Archipelago experts and headed towards the Gale Plains.</span></p><p><span style="">If everything went according to plan, Murong Xun and the others had very possibly already arrived at the Gale Plains and picked up the Ancient Adamantium Ores, and were returning right now.</span></p><p><span style="">That truly made Chu Feng anxious because if the Crippling Night Demon Sect had truly come, it was most likely they had already set up a trap. At that very moment, they could have already fell into the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s ploy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t worry. Even if just for your sake, I won&#x2019;t do nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Immortal Execution Archipelago has invited two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan, but they definitely would have never expected me to come here and help. If the Crippling Night Demon Sect has truly entered the trap, it isn&#x2019;t too big of a deal. We can just destroy their trap.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The flames of the Inferno Divine Bird clan are very powerful, but I will show them the most powerful flames are the Burning Heaven Church&#x2019;s Burning Heaven Flames,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said as she saw Chu Feng&#x2019;s agitated emotions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Qiushui, I truly apologize for dragging you into the battle between the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Immortal Execution Archipelago.&#x201D; Chu Feng felt very grateful for Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s words. At present, the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect were truly in a calamity, and even though accepting Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s assistance would make her an enemy of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, Chu Feng could not refuse.</span></p><p><span style="">After all, if the Crippling Night Demon Sect had truly fallen into the trap, he could not save them with his own strength. However, if Qiushui Fuyan helped, then they more or less had some strength to turn the battle around.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Silly boy, what are you talking about? The Immortal Execution Archipelago hasn&#x2019;t had their eyes on my Burning Heaven Church for just one or two days. We are already enemies, and sooner or later, there will be a conflict between us. Rather than later, why not sooner? After all, I&#x2019;m the only one remaining from the Burning Heaven Church. What can they do to me if I do what I want?&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan faintly smiled. Her face was calm, lacking even the slightest bit of fear towards the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng couldn&#x2019;t help but smile after hearing her words as the shame in his heart dropped quite a bit. She was very correct. Even if not for his sake, Qiushui Fuyan was, in reality, already an enemy of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There are people coming.&#x201D; But suddenly, Chu Feng frowned. In order to find the Crippling Night Demon Sect, he had spread out his Spirit power, thus his detection was very sensitive. Even though there was still some distance between him that those people, he still discovered their appearance.</span></p><p><span style="">Qiushui Fuyan also detected those people. However, she did not panic. Instead, she made a light smile, and said, &#x201C;I know these people. Since they&#x2019;ve come from the Gale Plains, perhaps we can acquire some information.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Qiushui, you know these people?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm, they&#x2019;re from the Lovers Terrace. Don&#x2019;t say anything. I&#x2019;ll go ask them,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm.&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded, and at the same time, used the Transformational Mask and changed his appearance. At the same time, he also lowered his cultivation, and followed behind Qiushui Fuyan like a servant.</span></p><p><span style="">Qiushui Fuyan intentionally lowered her speed, and flew forth without a hurry. Indeed, shortly after, several people were also flying towards them.</span></p><p><span style="">They were five elderly people. They wore common clothings, and their cultivations were at the peak of the Martial Lord realm. Although Qiushui Fuyan covered her face with her veil, they still recognized her. So, after seeing her, they quickly flew over, clasped their hands a hundred meters away, and asked in a probing manner, &#x201C;Is the person ahead Lady Qiushui of the Lovers Terrace?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Long time no see, everyone,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh, it truly is Lady Qiushui!&#x201D; The five elders were quite happy after they heard her voice. Since they had already confirmed her identity, they came over and one even said, &#x201C;Lady Qiushui, are you planning to head towards the Gale Plains?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Indeed.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I would advise you not to go. Right now, the journey to the Gale Plains is not too peaceful,&#x201D; that person said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why isn&#x2019;t it peaceful? Has something happened?&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan asked, feigning ignorance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;To be honest, the reason we&#x2019;re here is because we were captured,&#x201D; that elder said helplessly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Captured? What do you mean?&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A few days ago, there was someone from the Immortal Execution Archipelago who came to the Lovers Terrace. With the excuse of inviting us, they forced us there. We were brought directly to the Gale Plains, into the territory of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At first, we were still quite worried. We were worried whether we offended the Immortal Execution Archipelago and they were going to harm us.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, later on, there was an unending stream of scattered cultivation experts who were also captured by the Immortal Execution Archipelago. There were even many small sect heads brought into the Gale Plains. Moreover, they treated us quite well with food and drinks. Other than restricting our freedom, they were respectful in all ways. They seemed to mean no harm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We asked them why they brought us here, but they didn&#x2019;t tell us. They only said they invited us here to witness a good show.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And today, they&#x2019;ve finally released us, and we&#x2019;ve also finally learnt what their &#x2018;good show&#x2019; is.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it turns out that the Immortal Execution Archipelago has allied with the Inferno Divine Bird clan and they&#x2019;ve set up a trap together. They&#x2019;ve lured the Crippling Night Demon Sect and want to capture their experts all at once.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, they have already been caught and they are being killed by the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Inferno Divine Bird clan. To this so-called good show, none of us had the heart to enjoy it, so we left,&#x201D; the elder narrated in detail.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Qiushui, right now, the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Crippling Night Demon Sect are still fighting one another. Do not head over. Otherwise, if they learn of that, who knows whether they will think we&#x2019;ve started to associate with the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they drag us into their fury while they&#x2019;re in a rage, that would not be good at all.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah, yeah! Quickly join us and leave! Let&#x2019;s quickly leave this disaster zone!&#x201D; the four others urged.</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard that, Chu Feng tightly clenched his fists as his heart was submerged within anger. No matter what, he didn&#x2019;t expect the Immortal Execution Archipelago would be that despicable. Not only did they lay a trap, they even looked for a crowd beforehand and wanted to humiliate the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; In reality, it was not only Chu Feng who was enraged. Even Qiushui Fuyan couldn&#x2019;t continue staying here. She grabbed Chu Feng, then disappeared instantly. With the quickest speed possible, they flew towards the Gale Plains.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, they left the five elders standing on the spot. Their expressions were frozen as they looked at each other, saying simultaneously, &#x201C;Just now, Lady Qiushui seemed to have said&#x2026; the young man by her&#xA0;side was Chu Feng?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they spoke, their complexion changed greatly. They suddenly realized the calamity they had made, and without saying anything more, they fled with their lives.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
