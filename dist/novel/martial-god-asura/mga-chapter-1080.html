<p>Golden colored lightning covered the entire horizon. It was as if there were ten thousand dragons galloping and bellowing in the sky. The display truly brought about shock and terror to everyone.</p><p>However, at this moment, the thing that was most shocking was the color of the lightning. It was gold, it was actually golden colored.</p><p>Legend has it that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle would emit different colored lightning depending on the race of the person who triggered it. For humans, it would be gold. For monstrous beasts, red; and for the Elves, green.</p><p>In the past, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle had emitted green lightning every time it was triggered. This caused many people to feel that the legend was false.</p><p>Yet, today, the lightning released was a different color. Moreover, it was the color being triggered by a human, gold. How could this not shock everyone?</p><p>&#x201C;Golden lightning, it&#x2019;s actually a golden lightning.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve succeeded! We&#x2019;ve actually succeeded! After all these years, us humans finally have someone who&#x2019;s managed to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle!&#x201D;</p><p>After a brief moment of silence, all the humans, whether within the walls or outside the walls, were overjoyed. An uncontainable excitement burst forth from them.</p><p>Golden lightning. In all these years, no one managed to trigger such lightning. Yet today, golden lightning was actually triggered. The humans were naturally overjoyed by this sudden turn of events because this was considered to be glory for all humans.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s actually a golden lightning? Could it be that Yuan Qing succeeded?&#x201D; Compared to the others, the two management elders from the Orion Monastery were even more excited. That was because they believed that only their disciple Yuan Qing was able to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle.</p><p>In fact, it was not only them who felt this way. Practically everyone from outside the city wall felt this way as they had all placed their hopes on Yuan Qing.</p><p>However, at the moment when all of the humans were in ecstasy, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves were thoroughly shocked. Especially the Southern Elf Lord, his current frame of mind was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; how could this be? How could this be?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Xian Kun, exactly what is happening? Didn&#x2019;t you say that you would be able to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle? But what is this? What sort of situation is this? Why did the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle release a golden lightning? Speak, what exactly is happening?&#x201D; Overly emotional, that Southern Elf Lord actually grabbed Xian Kun&#x2019;s collar and raised him. In anger, he snarled at Xian Kun.</p><p>He was truly, overly enraged, so enraged that he no longer cared about Xian Kun&#x2019;s identity and strength. That was because the moment when the golden lightning was released, he already knew that a great catastrophe would befall him.</p><p>All these years, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles had never been triggered by humans or monstrous beasts. Yet today, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle in his territory was triggered by a human. To the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, this was an extraordinary shame and humiliation. He knew that the Elf King would not let him get away with it.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; I also do not know what happened. I clearly&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Xian Kun was also panicking. Regardless of how conceited he was, he still knew that the Southern Elf Lord possessed the strength to kill him in an instant. At the time when the Southern Elf Lord revered him, he could do whatever he wanted. Yet now, during the time when the Southern Elf Lord was frantically enraged, he no longer dared to provoke the Southern Elf Lord. Instead, now he needed to try to free himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Clearly what?! Could it be that you did not discover a human arriving at the bottom of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond?!&#x201D; Interrogated the Southern Elf Lord.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Xian Kun was left speechless. That was because he had truly not bothered to inspect whether there might be anyone else other than him at the bottom of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>At that time, he conceitedly believed that no one other than him would be able to reach the bottom. However, he now discovered that he was gravely mistaken. That was because the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle had been triggered and even released golden lightning on top of that; a sign that it was triggered by a human.</p><p>Upon recalling of how there was no reaction to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle even though he had stayed in the bottom of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond for so long, he now realized the reason. That was, other than him, there was another person at the bottom of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, he discovered it much too late.</p><p>&#x201C;Abominable! He actually fooled me! I shall go and seize this bastard from the Immortal Pond right now and make him pay the price for his conduct!&#x201D;</p><p>After realizing what had happened, rage also covered Xian Kun&#x2019;s face. He shook off the Southern Elf Lord&#x2019;s hand that was grabbing him and tried to enter into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond once again in hope of capturing the person who triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuuaaooo~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, an ear-piercing bellow suddenly sounded from the depths of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. Not only was that sound extremely loud and clear, it also contained an immense amount of might. It was as if the sound did not originate from something ordinary at all. Instead, it sounded more like the bellow of gods. It was truly soul-shaking. Not only did it bring about awe to the people, it also caused them to be greatly afraid.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble.&#x201D;</p><p>After the sound echoed through the space, enormous waves suddenly appeared on the previously calm Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. Those enormous waves revolved around the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle and created an enormous whirlpool. That surging whirlpool&#x2019;s might was overflowing. Moreover, lightning sparks could actually be seen in the whirlpool.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D; At this moment, everyone lowered their heads and cast their gazes at the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. That was because they were able to tell that a gargantuan change was happening to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. It appeared as if something was about to emerge from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble.&#x201D; Finally, before the numerous gazes of the crowd, five lightnings were shot out from the center of the whirlpool. They revolved around the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle as they soared straight to the sky.</p><p>It was five lightnings with different appearances and colors. They were respectively purple, gold, blue, red and black.</p><p>Five different colors. However, these five lightnings were somewhat different from the enormous net of lightning that was being released by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. The might of these five lightnings appeared to be even more divine, even more ferocious. Most importantly, those five lightnings appeared as if they were living. They did not appear to be released by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle but appeared more like they&#x2019;re running up the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle.</p><p>Finally, the five divine lightnings arrived at the top of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. Only then did they separate themselves from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. However, unlike the golden lightning above the Immortal Needle, they did not disperse. Instead, they turned into five enormous and ferocious lightning beasts.</p><p>At the moment when the five lightning beasts appeared, the sky instantly turned dark. Even though the golden lightning released by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle was still present, the ruler of the sky appeared to be those five lightning beasts.</p><p>That was because the aura emitted by these lightning beasts were too frightening and indescribably strong. Such a powerful might simply does not appear to be something from this world.</p><p>Before these five lightning beasts, regardless of whether it was the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, the humans or the monstrous beasts, they all felt how tiny they were. Before the five lightning beasts, they were truly tiny, as tiny as a speck of dust, unworthy of even mentioning.</p><p>&#x201C;What is that?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, everyone was stunned. As they looked to the five enormous lightning beasts that revolved around the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle, they were both shocked and fearful. Yet, they did not know what to do.</p><p>That was because the scene before them was truly different from the times when the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle was triggered in the past. To be exact, this time was even more magnificent, even more spectacular, even more of amazing. Most importantly, those five enormous lightning beasts were truly too terrifying. It was as if if they wished for it, they would be able to easily flatten this entire region and turn all of them into ashes.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
