<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 823 - Shaken</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it starting again?&#x201D; However, when Zi Ling heard some noises, she was not worried at all. Instead, her face was one of helplessness. Clearly, she knew what was happening outside.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Chu Feng spread out his Spirit power. He discovered there was actually no enemy invading. So, he quickly brought Zi Ling out of the cave for observation.</span></p><p><span style="">After coming outside the cave, only then did Chu Feng find out they were hiding within a vast mountain range. In their surroundings, layers of Concealment Spirit Formations were laid, so everything they did wouldn&#x2019;t be discovered by others. Clearly, they were laid by Zi Ling&#x2019;s parents.</span></p><p><span style="">And, at present, in the nearby sky, Zi Xuanyuan and the others were trying to capture something. Looking closely, Chu Feng discovered it was a Delivery Bird.</span></p><p><span style="">However, it was a very powerful one. Not only was it able to conceal its aura, thus avoiding Spirit power and any sort of detection, it had eighteen pairs of wings. Its speed was fast, akin to light. Even he himself was quite inferior.</span></p><p><span style="">It was simply a waste of strength for Zi Xuanyuan and the others to surround the Delivery Bird, as it was impossible for them to capture it. The bird was merely toying with them now.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh* But after the Delivery Bird saw Chu Feng, it fiercely flapped its wings, and like light, after it arrived in front of Chu Feng, it started flying around him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s&#x2026; come for me?&#x201D; When he saw that, Chu Feng couldn&#x2019;t help casting his gaze at Zi Ling, who was behind him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It has been here for several days already, and it only flies around you. If any other person nears it, it will escape. Moreover, it&#x2019;s too fast. I have never seen a Delivery Bird with this speed before. It likely some expert who has sent you a letter.&#x201D; Zi Ling sweetly smiled; she was quite bewitching.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng slowly opened his palms when he heard that. After another circle around him, the Delivery Bird actually gradually descended. In the end, it stood atop his palms, and at that moment, Chu Feng discovered a Spirit Formation on the Delivery Bird&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">That Spirit Formation was a very complex one. Within it was a message, and unless it was an expert in Spirit Formations, they were unable to obtain the information inside if they were unable to break open the Spirit Formation, even if they captured the Delivery Bird.</span></p><p><span style="">Because, when deactivating the formation, as long as there was one mistake, the message within the formation would be erased. The person who sent that message to Chu Feng really did have powerful techniques. It was a very careful person.</span></p><p><span style="">However, that Spirit Formation did not trouble Chu Feng at all. At present, Chu Feng was a Spirit Formation expert&#x2014;that was publicly agreed. Although he was only a Purple-cloak World Spiritist, he, who grasped the Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, had already surpassed a few normal Gold-cloak World Spiritists in terms of true accomplishments in Spirit Formation techniques.</span></p><p><span style="">After a few simple actions, Chu Feng deactivated the Spirit Formation on the Delivery Bird. The message hidden inside also entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s head completely.</span></p><p><span style="">After obtaining that message, Chu Feng lightly frowned, then looked at Zi Ling by his side. &#x201C;Zi Ling, how long was I unconscious for?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One month,&#x201D; Zi Ling replied truthfully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;One month? Then, in that month, has the Immortal Execution Archipelago made any move?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;They have. You not only joined up with the Crippling Night Demon Sect and killed the Eighth and Ninth Immortal, you even killed Ya Fei and stole Murong Xun&#x2019;s Royal Armament. Then, you kidnapped Zi Ling. All of your actions truly represented repeatedly slapping the face of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And since you&#x2019;ve successfully challenged the might of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, it as a whole now despises you. They dream to skin you alive and torture you, and have put down wanted posters throughout the entire Eastern Sea Region. No matter who it is, as long as they provide information regarding you, they would receive a large reward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Similarly, no matter who it is, as long as they dare to hide you, the Immortal Execution Archipelago would send an army without mercy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not only you, the Immortal Execution Archipelago even formally announced war against the Crippling Night Demon Sect. They sent out large numbers of experts to search for the whereabouts of the members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Those who are found will be killed without exception.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, the Immortal Execution Archipelago even sent out invitations for an alliance. At present, the forces that have some strength received this invitation. The Three Great Monstrous Clans, who usually have nothing to do with humans, also received this invitation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Using rewards as bait, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is trying to ally all the powerful forces of the Eastern Sea Region, and with the reason of &#x2018;exterminating demons&#x2019;, they swear to remove the Crippling Night Demon Sect. This time, the Immortal Execution Archipelago has truly become enraged,&#x201D; Zi Xuanyuan gravely narrated. In the past month, although they were hiding here, they were not idly sitting around. They had learnt quite a bit of information, and even though the Eastern Sea Region was large, due to the existence of Delivery Birds, the spreading of information was very quick. Within a short month, everything was known.</span></p><p><span style="">Also within the short month, an enormous change happened to the Eastern Sea Region. It, which had been in peace for a long while, once again faced a new era with the flames of war flying everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">Was the Immortal Execution Archipelago going to hold its position of overlord, or would the Crippling Night Demon Sect take back its former glory? Or, perhaps, a powerful force that had been waiting would surprise everyone, and obtain power amidst the chaos? Everything was filled with uncertainty.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You said the Immortal Execution Archipelago said I killed Ya Fei?&#x201D; In comparison to the other chaos occurring however, Chu Feng was more intrigued with that question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm. The Immortal Execution Archipelago did say that. However, the Crippling Night Demon Sect also let word out that said Murong Xun killed Ya Fei. Moreover, they said you took Ya Fei and&#x2026;&#x201D; When he spoke up to there, Zi Xuanyuan stopped.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng could feel everyone looking away from himself, and only Zi Ling&#x2019;s eyes remained on him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh, do you believe their words?&#x201D; Chu Feng turned around and chuckled at Zi Ling. But, in his eyes, there was a bit of guilt because he knew what the Crippling Night Demon Sect said. They definitely announced, without an ounce of restraint, that he took down Ya Fei.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I do. What is there to disbelieve? That does seem like your style of doing things!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A smirk appeared on Zi Ling&#x2019;s face when she said that, intentionally making herself harbour evil intents. But, the warmth in her eyes told Chu Feng that she didn&#x2019;t blame him at all, nor was she angry at him.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng&#x2019;s tense heart gradually relaxed when he saw Zi Ling wasn&#x2019;t mad, and only then did he ask Zi Xuanyuan again, &#x201C;Senior Xuanyuan, other than Ya Fei, what else did the Crippling Night Demon Sect say?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Crippling Night Demon Sect said you have already joined them, that you are already a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Those who dare to harm you will have their entire family eradicated by them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, the Crippling Night Demon Sect also sent a counterattack. Of the Five Elemental Kings, the Earth King, the Gold King, and the Wood King have all shown themselves and attacked several important territories of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, causing severe losses for them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If they didn&#x2019;t, the Immortal Execution Archipelago wouldn&#x2019;t have put so many beneficial rewards as bait to ally with other forces, to even send out an invitation to the Three Great Monstrous Clans. The Crippling Night Demon Sect is indeed very powerful, and now, they are hidden from view so the Immortal Execution Archipelago have suffered quite a few losses,&#x201D; Zi Xuanyuan continued saying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then no wonder.&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded, as if he understood something.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
