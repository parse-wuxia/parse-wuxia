<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 480 - The Horrifying Ice and Fire Pearls</strong></p><p><span style="">After the Jiang Dynasty&#x2019;s banquet, Chu Feng and the others hurried towards the Azure Dragon School.</span></p><p><span style="">But before leaving, the Monstrous Monkey King entrusted the Jiang Dynasty with two things. The first thing was that Chu Feng needed a large amount of manpower and resources in order to rebuild the Azure Dragon School.</span></p><p><span style="">The second thing was to use its name to find the five Monster Kings of the Thousand Monster Mountain by declaring it to the world, and telling the five Monster Kings to lead all the Monstrous Beasts in the Thousand Monster Mountain to hurry towards the Azure Dragon Mountain Range to join up with him.</span></p><p><span style="">Naturally, the Jiang Dynasty unhesitantly agreed to the two requests from the Monstrous Monkey King.</span></p><p><span style="">After a period of hastening, Chu Feng and the others finally returned to the Azure Dragon Mountain Range. But in order to prevent the Azure Dragon Founder from being displeased, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t tell the Monstrous Monkey King about the Azure Dragon Founder still surviving the world.</span></p><p><span style="">So, Chu Feng first entered the Thousand Bone Graveyard and told the Azure Dragon Founder that he asked for a Purple-cloak World Spiritist, and that it could save Su Rou and Su Mei. He also asked whether the Azure Dragon Founder wanted the Purple-cloak World Spiritist to help him recast his physical body or not.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh Chu Feng, recasting a physical body is not a small matter. I don&#x2019;t want to trouble outsiders.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Besides, I&#x2019;ve waited for a thousand years, a few more won&#x2019;t make much of a difference. So, I&#x2019;ll still wait until you become a Purple-cloak World Spiritist before recasting my physical body for me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As for the news of me still being in this world, unless there is no other choice, do not tell anyone.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, I will relay a formation and take my physical body and the treasure pearl deeper into this Emperor Tomb.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, after taking away the treasure pearl, the Ice and Fire Pearls in Su Rou&#x2019;s and Su Mei&#x2019;s bodies will not be stable.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, you must immediately call the Purple-cloak World Spiritist in. I&#x2019;m sure with his methods, he should be able to protect Su Rou&#x2019;s and Su Mei&#x2019;s lives.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Indeed, as he predicted, the Azure Dragon Founder refused the assistance of the Monstrous Monkey King, as he hoped that they wouldn&apos;t know about his survival.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I shall obey your order.&#x201D; Chu Feng respectfully responded, then quickly after, helped the Azure Dragon Founder undo the current formation. After taking out his physical body and the mystical pearl, he relaid a formation to seal Su Rou and Su Mei.</span></p><p><span style="">But without the power of the mystical pearl, it was very difficult to suppress the Ice and Fire Pearls in Su Rou&#x2019;s and Su Mei&#x2019;s bodies purely with the power of the formation. In only an instant, the Sealing Formation was taken over by blue-coloured frost and scorching flames. They endlessly made howls like tigers and leopards, started to insanely charge towards the formation, and wanted to break out.</span></p><p><span style="">In a situation like that, Chu Feng had no choice but to quickly ask the Monstrous Monkey King to enter, to let the Purple-cloak World Spiritist control the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">The Azure Dragon Founder&#x2019;s speed was also very quick. Before the Monstrous Monkey King came down, he had already moved his own physical body and the mystical pearl deep into the Thousand Bone Graveyard. Only with that did he prevent the Monstrous Monkey King from discovering his physical body and the mystical pearl.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;These two pearls are very powerful. Chu Feng, where did these pearls come from&#x201D; After the Monstrous Monkey King entered the Thousand Bone Graveyard and saw the power of the ice and fire, it was endlessly shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I found them deep in the Thousand Bone Graveyard. Monkey Bro, how is it? Can you save Su Rou and Su Mei?&#x201D; Seeing the Monstrous Monkey King&#x2019;s shocked expression, Chu Feng lightly furrowed his brows, being a bit worried.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure. These two pearls are too powerful, much more powerful than Elite Armaments. And, they are living objects. Right now, they have already merged with your two wives&#x2019; bodies, so it&#x2019;s impossible to want to take them out. I can only use special Sealing Formations to temporarily seal them. As for whether it will succeed or not, that&#x2019;ll depend on your two wives&#x2019; physical state and willpower.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it succeeds, then the two pearls&#x2019; power can be temporarily suppressed. If it fails, then the two pearls will thoroughly take over their physical bodies and be revived.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At that time, not only will they die, we will be dragged down with them as well. Even the entire continent of the Nine Provinces, possibly even the continents outside of this continent will enter danger.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s because these pearls are too powerful. I feel like their true power have been sealed. They are filled with evilness and their resentments are extremely deep. If they were to be unsealed, the living will definitely enter hell. That will be very terrifying. I simply don&#x2019;t even dare to imagine it.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, if I lay another Sealing Formation and seal your two wives along with the pearls, it can stop their revival. However, the price is that your two wives will also die.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, make a choice. To risk it, or to not risk it. Just say it, and I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201D; The Monstrous Monkey King said with a face filled with solemnness. It was the first time Chu Feng saw the Monstrous Monkey King show such an expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;m begging you! Save my daughters, don&#x2019;t let them die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;m also begging you! Save my two sisters! They love you so deeply, so how can you bear letting them die?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Su Rou and Su Mei&#x2019;s father and elder brother had actually knelt onto the ground with a poof and started to beg.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, this is not a small matter. I urge you to value the big picture.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah, Chu Feng. This wager is too big. Do not make it! Because, if it is lost, not only us, even the entire continent will be affected!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But after knowing how horrifying the two pearls were, there were also people who spoke to urge Chu Feng. Their intentions were to get Chu Feng to directly seal the two pearls, and simultaneously, sacrificing Su Rou&#x2019;s and Su Mei&#x2019;s lives.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, as a man, don&#x2019;t pay attention to the small matters in life. For all things, the big picture must be valued.&#x201D; And seeing the more and more surging frost and flames in the Sealing Formation, there were even more people who were scared. They started to urge him otherwise, because if the sealing failed, obviously, they were going to be the first ones to be sacrificed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;God damn, are you even people? Junior Chu Feng views you as close ones to him, but now you want him to watch the ones he love die?&#x201D; Just at that time, Zhang Tianyi was enraged as he pointed at the crowd and furiously howled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The words cannot be spoken like that. Su Rou and Su Mei are close people to him, but we aren&#x2019;t?&#x201D; Some members of the Chu family retorted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Cheng, Chu Zhen, Chu Mingsheng, all of you shut up.&#x201D; Chu Guyu fiercely glared at the Chu family members, then said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Brother. Save Su Rou and Su Mei. They are in this state because of you, so you must save them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, you have to save Su Rou and Su Mei. At worst, we&#x2019;ll just die with them. Our lives were saved by you after all.&#x201D; Chu Yue also spoke to advise.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Guyu, Chu Yue, the two of you cannot decide if we live or die, and even more so, you cannot choose the fate of the billions of lives on this continent.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, you must think clearly. That senior has already said that if the two pearls are revived, the entire continent of the Nine Provinces, even beyond, will meet with disaster. At that time, you will become a person whose crimes are forever remembered.&#x201D; Even more people started to urge Chu Feng to give Su Rou and Su Mei up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of you, shut up! Does Chu Feng need your interruptions when deciding?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill whoever speaks more right now.&#x201D; Just at that time, Zi Ling became furious. Her purple pupils flashed as she pointed at the crowd and fiercely yelled. At the same time, her purple-coloured aura also pounced out like a fierce beast.</span></p><p><span style="">When that aura was burst out, the people on scene, other than Chu Feng, Zhang Tianyi, and the Monstrous Monkey King, were all pushed continuously back from the charge. There were even some people who got heavily injured.</span></p><p><span style="">And at that instant, everyone on scene shut their mouths because they could feel how terrifying Zi Ling was at that moment. Her killing intent was unfelt by them before, so they knew if they dared to speak anymore, Zi Ling would definitely, unhesitantly, kill them.</span></p><p><span style="">Therefore, everyone chose to remain silent. No one dared to speak anymore as they cast their gazes towards Chu Feng, awaiting his decision.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
