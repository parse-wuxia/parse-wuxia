<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1658 - The Appearance Of The Witch</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Followed my aura?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing that, Chu Feng came to realize how the White-browed Immortal had managed to find him. Merely, he did not expect the White-browed Immortal to know such a technique where he could find Chu Feng without the need of any imprint, and only needing his aura.</p><p>However, upon thinking about it, Chu Feng could understand that it was possible. Back then, in the Sealing Ancient Village, Chu Feng and those with him had managed to track the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s traitor through the use of a special spirit formation.</p><p>As for this White-browed Immortal, he was one of the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s ten greatest Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. It was not surprising at all for him to have grasped such a technique.</p><p>Thus, it was Chu Feng who had been careless this time around. Merely, Chu Feng was feeling extremely unreconciled at being captured by the White-browed Immortal this quickly. He was even more unreconciled to die at the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong? Feeling unreconciled? That&#x2019;s what you should be feeling. This is the gap between you and me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if your talent for world spirit techniques is extremely amazing, even if you are able to obtain the power of the Asura Spirit World, you are still much too weak when compared to me. After all, I am a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, whereas you&#x2019;re a mere Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal said with a cold laugh. However, one could hear a faint amount of jealousy in his words.</p><p>From merely those words, one could tell why the White-browed Immortal detested Chu Feng this enormously. Evidently, he was jealous of Chu Feng&#x2019;s talent, jealous that Chu Feng was an Asura World Spiritist.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you planning to do?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Nothing much. I&#x2019;ll bring you back to the Nangong Imperial Clan. Clan Chief Nangong shall handle you personally,&#x201D; said the White-browed Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t plan to kill me?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill you? If I wanted to kill you, it would be easier than crushing an ant to death. However, you have done extremely malicious deeds to the Nangong Imperial Clan. Thus, Clan Chief Nangong should personally execute you before the Nangong Imperial Clansmen.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve done extremely malicious deeds? Haha&#x2026; you, as the nominal elder of the Nangong Imperial Clan, should know better than me as to exactly what had happened back then.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All that I, Chu Feng, have done was forced onto me by you all,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a cold voice.</p><p>&#x201C;My my my, what a &#x2018;forced onto you.&#x2019; Indeed, we indeed forced you. Forced you to release an Asura Evil Spirit.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Truth be told, I never saw you personally release that Asura Evil Spirit. Thus, I really do not believe that you are capable of releasing that Asura Evil Spirit.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How about this? I&#x2019;ll force you again today, so that you can release another Asura Evil Spirit to broaden my knowledge. What do you say?&#x201D;</p><p>As the White-browed Immortal spoke, he arrived before Chu Feng, grabbed his neck and raised him up. At a close range, he said, &#x201C;Come, release another Evil Spirit. Aren&#x2019;t you extremely powerful? Aren&#x2019;t you an Asura World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since you could release one, you should be able to release another. Why aren&#x2019;t you releasing it? The way I see it, you simply cannot release an Asura Evil Spirit to begin with. That Asura Evil Spirit from that day wasn&#x2019;t released by you to begin with.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My guess is correct, no? The true Asura World Spiritist is simply not you. You have an Asura World Spiritist behind you, isn&#x2019;t that right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Seeing the White-browed Immortal acting in such a manner, Chu Feng laughed and shook his head.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you laughing about?&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal frowned and asked with a cold voice.</p><p>&#x201C;I had thought that the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s legendary Ten Immortals were all like the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, like real Immortals.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, after I met you, I discovered that I was mistaken. There is actually a person as filthy as you among the Ten Immortals,&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s words were filled with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;Filthy? You dare to call me filthy?!&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal was extremely angry upon hearing those words. He could tell that Chu Feng was insulting him.</p><p>&#x201C;You spoke of an Asura Evil Spirit every single time you opened your mouth. You are actually extremely envious of me, no? You&#x2019;re extremely jealous of me, isn&#x2019;t that right? You are envious and jealous that I managed to obtain the approval of an Asura World Spirit, while you have not. That&#x2019;s why you detest me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although you&#x2019;re known to be an Immortal, you&#x2019;re actually such a narrow-minded individual that you cannot watch others be superior to you. With your mindset, you are simply unworthy of the title Immortal,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you are the first to dare to insult me like this. Did you really think that I would not dare to kill you?&#x201D; Killing intent began to emerge in the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s anger-filled eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Killing him? You&#x2019;re not qualified.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded from the distance. Following that, a stream of violent power surged forth while covering the entire region.</p><p>That power was simply too ferocious. In merely an instant, it had shattered the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak world spirit formations set up by the White-browed Immortal.</p><p>When the spirit formations were shattered, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>When that person appeared, everyone present was shocked. That was because this person was emitting an extremely frightening killing intent that caused even the weather to be affected.</p><p>This person was none other than the white-haired witch Chu Feng had encountered that day. Merely, this time around, it was not her clone, but rather her true self, who had come.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After this witch appeared, she lightly waved her sleeve, and a frantic power surged forth explosively. That power directly sucked Chu Feng over from the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s grasp.</p><p>&#x201C;Snow-haired Immortal, it&#x2019;s actually you?!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing this witch, the White-browed Immortal was even more shocked than Chu Feng. Furthermore, based on his reaction, he seemed to know this witch.</p><p>&#x201C;Snow-haired Immortal, this witch is also one of the Ten Immortals? One of the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s ten Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists?&#x201D; After hearing what the White-browed Immortal uttered, Chu Feng was also shocked. The reason for that was because this woman, no matter how one looked at her, simply did not resemble an immortal at all; she was simply a witch.</p><p>&#x201C;Snow-haired Immortal, I truly never would have expected that the person behind Chu Feng would be you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That Chu Feng should be your personal disciple, right? Weren&#x2019;t you known to never accept disciples?&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;All of you, scram!&#x201D; However, not only did the witch not answer the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s question, she instead cursed at them. Her attitude was extremely arrogant. She had simply not placed the White-browed Immortal in her eyes at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Snow-haired Immortal, that Chu Feng is the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s wanted criminal. Even you will not be able to shelter him,&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal continued.</p><p>&#x201C;If you dare to utter another word of this rubbish, I&#x2019;ll kill you,&#x201D; When the witch said these words, the sky instantly darkened, and space started to shatter and violently shake. Even the peak Half Martial Emperors present were unable to stand firm. They began to roll and crawl in mid-air.</p><p>Before this ferociously oppressive might, the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s complexion turned deathly pale. In fact, even his body was wavering left and right, unable to stand firmly. Evidently, even though he was a rank two Martial Emperor, he was unable to contend against that witch.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; In this sort of situation, even though the White-browed Immortal was feeling extremely unreconciled, he still ended up leading his people and leaving.</p><p>As Chu Feng saw the White-browed Immortal and the others leaving before his sight, Chu Feng did not feel the slightest bit of joy. The scene from earlier had shown him that this woman known as the Snow-haired Immortal was much more frightening than the White-browed Immortal.</p><p>When even the White-browed Immortal feared her, how could Chu Feng possibly not fear her?</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, that scroll, it&#x2026;&#x201D; At this moment, Chu Feng wanted to explain.</p><p>However, before Chu Feng could finish what he wanted to say, the Snow-haired Immortal cut him off, &#x201C;That scroll is not on you. Tell me truthfully where it has gone to.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, I was properly looking after that scroll for you. However, a fat monk suddenly appeared. That fat monk&#x2019;s cultivation greatly surpassed this junior&#x2019;s. Junior was simply no match for him. That scroll has been snatched away by him,&#x201D; Chu Feng did not dare to conceal this. However, he also did not dare to say that he had personally handed over the scroll to that monk. In this moment of crisis, he lied a bit.</p><p>&#x201C;Damned fatty, he actually acted as the fisherman.&#x201D; After hearing what Chu Feng said, that Snow-haired Immortal&#x2019;s eyes were filled with even more intense killing intent.</p><p>[1. Fisherman&#x2019;s benefit: A chinese story where a snipe caught an oyster and a fisherman came from behind to snatch them both. Basically, profiting from the conflicts of others.]</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, exactly who is that fat monk? You should know him, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked curiously.</p><p>That Snow-haired Immortal did not answer Chu Feng&#x2019;s question. Instead, she suddenly turned around and looked to Chu Feng with her murderous-looking gaze.</p><p>With that gaze looking at him, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart shivered. How could this possibly be a gaze? This was simply akin to countless sharp blades penetrating his body.</p><p>Fortunately, Chu Feng possessed a strong spirit. Else, this gaze was sufficient to cause Chu Feng to have a nervous breakdown, turning him into a madman.</p><p>Right at this moment, that Snow-haired Immortal asked, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard that you&#x2019;re an Asura World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
