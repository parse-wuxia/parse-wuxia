<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1617 - An Imprint</strong></p><p>Evildoer Tie pointed at Chu Feng and angrily shouted, &#x201C;Damned bastard, you simply competed with my bidding out of malice. You are despicable and shameless!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Auctioneer, I would like to file a complaint. This Evildoer Tie is attacking me personally,&#x201D; Chu Feng would naturally not admit that he had competed with Evildoer Tie out of malice. Not only did he not admit to it, he even accused Evildoer Tie of attacking his character.</p><p>&#x201C;Evildoer Tie, I already warned you earlier, yet you still refuse to change your behavior. Do you really think that we will not dare to drive you out?&#x201D; That beautiful auctioneer narrowed her long, shapely eyebrows and spoke with a cold voice.</p><p>If the auctioneer had displayed a very graceful bearing on the auction stage before, then, at this moment, what she was displaying was the the domineering aura of an expert.</p><p>However, regardless of how domineering that auctioneer might be, she was still only a peak Half Martial Emperor. As a Martial Emperor, how could Evildoer Tie possibly place her in his eyes? In anger, Evildoer Tie coldly snorted, stood up, pointed at that auctioneer and was planning to refute her.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, the white-haired old man on the auction stage, who had had his eyes closed the entire time, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>Once his eyes opened, two rays of light flashed out from his eyes. Those rays of light landed on Evildoer Tie, causing his body to tremble instantly. &#x201C;Putt,&#x201D; Evildoer Tie fell back onto his seat.</p><p>In merely an instant, Evildoer Tie&#x2019;s complexion turned extremely pale, and he started to sweat enormously. In fact, even his body was trembling.</p><p>All of this was completely evident to all of the people present. When the crowd looked back to that white-haired old man, they all felt deep veneration for him. Sure enough, that old man was frighteningly powerful. Even one of the Five Great Evildoers, Evildoer Tie, was unable to withstand a single blow from him.</p><p>That white-haired old man did not say anything. After he frightened Evildoer Tie with his gaze, he once again closed his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget about it, I am not someone to fuss over minor matters. Just give him another chance,&#x201D; Right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Since the person filing the complaint was willing to give you another chance, I&#x2019;ll also give you another chance. However, remember, this cannot be repeated,&#x201D; The auctioneer warned.</p><p>&#x201C;You all&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Evildoer Tie was so enraged that he nearly died from anger. It was clearly him who had been scammed. Yet, he still had to receive this sort of treatment. He was so angry that his heart and lungs were on the verge of exploding.</p><p>However, the helpless thing was, regardless of how unreconciled he might be, there was still nothing he could do. This was not a place where he could behave atrociously.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, there&#x2019;s no need for you to drive me out, this old man will leave by himself.&#x201D; In the end, Evildoer Tie snorted coldly, waved his sleeve, and actually planned to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;While leaving is fine, you must first pay the bill,&#x201D; The auctioneer said.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need for you to remind me of that. This old man already knows.&#x201D; Furiously, Evildoer Tie walked out from the auction house. At the same time as he walked out, several people from the Heavenly Law Auction followed him out after being directed by the auctioneer.</p><p>At this moment, many people realized that Chu Feng had actually deliberately dug a pit for Evildoer Tie to jump into. Furthermore, he had succeeded.</p><p>When the crowd thought of how Chu Feng had managed to deceive the notorious Evildoer Tie like that and make him lose out this enormously, many people felt a great deal of joy. Secretly, they began to extend their thumbs toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing. Brother, you are amazing.&#x201D;</p><p>Especially those who possessed enormous hatred for Evildoer Tie. At this moment, they actually disregarded the occasion and began to cheer for Chu Feng. The reason for that was because Chu Feng&#x2019;s action was truly satisfying to them.</p><p>In fact, not to mention the others, even the Heavenly Law Auction&#x2019;s auctioneer nodded her head at Chu Feng while smiling. It would seem that even she disliked that Evildoer Tie.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you are too amazing. To think of such a method to scam Evildoer Tie, haha, this is truly satisfying!&#x201D;</p><p>Naturally, Aunt Lian and the others also felt enormous joy. They actually began to secretly send voice transmissions to Chu Feng to praise his wit.</p><p>Especially Aunt Lian, who was feeling enormously happy. The reason for that was because Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions had caused Evildoer Tie to lose out enormously. Not only had Chu Feng humiliated Evildoer Tie, he had also made him suffer enormously in terms of wealth. Chu Feng&#x2019;s method was much more brilliant than her own.</p><p>However, regardless, as long as Evildoer Tie suffered, Aunt Lian would feel happy. After all, there was a blood feud between them.</p><p>Unfortunately, after Evildoer Tie left, none of the items Chu Feng and the others had placed on auction managed to be bid on. It was not that no one wanted them. Rather, it was that no one was able to afford the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones to bid on them. In the end, only Chu Feng&#x2019;s Sealing Glacier managed to be auctioned off.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was not disappointed because of this. Instead, he felt very happy. As he would not have to sell others&#x2019; things, Chu Feng would have to owe fewer favors. This was especially true for Hong Qiang&#x2019;s Raging Flames Metal. Chu Feng did not wish to sell that. After all, that was something that Hong Qiang had spent meticulous efforts to obtain.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng already possessed forty Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. On top of that, his Sealing Glacier had been auctioned to Evildoer Tie for ninety-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. Altogether, Chu Feng possessed a hundred and thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. This was more than Chu Feng had anticipated.</p><p>As the auction continued, Aunt Lian helped Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe, Nangong Moli and even Tantai Xue to win some treasures.</p><p>She won a defensive treasure for Nangong Ya. As for Nangong Baihe, Nangong Moli and Tantai Xue, she won them some ornaments that the girls were fond of.</p><p>Aunt Lian had wanted to help Chu Feng win some things from the auction. However, Chu Feng resolutely refused. That was because Aunt Lian had already spent a great amount of wealth to help him purchase Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. Thus, Chu Feng really did not wish for her to spend any more wealth on him.</p><p>Just like this, the auction ended. From the backstage of the auction, Chu Feng obtained the ninety-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones smoothly.</p><p>Merely, after he received the ninety-nine Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, Chu Feng started to frown. He had discovered that something was amiss.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian, Senior Hong Qiang, something&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201D; Sensing that something was wrong, Chu Feng immediately called Aunt Lian and the others to the side.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what&#x2019;s wrong? Could it be that these Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones are fake? That shouldn&#x2019;t be the case, no? If they are fake, they shouldn&#x2019;t be able to escape the eyes of the Heavenly Law Auction.&#x201D; When Aunt Lian saw that Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed when he inspected the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, she thought that the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones were fake.</p><p>Chu Feng took out a Dragon Mark World Spirit Stone and said, &#x201C;These Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones are real. Merely, one among them has been altered. Even though it&#x2019;s very hidden, I am certain that there&#x2019;s an imprint left behind within it.&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Hong Qiang and Aunt Lian carefully inspected the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stone. However, even though the two of them were also both Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, they were unable to find anything wrong with the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stone. Thus, they asked together, &#x201C;Chu Feng, are you certain that there&#x2019;s an imprint on this Dragon Mark World Spirit Stone?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am certain that there&#x2019;s an imprint on it. Furthermore, if my guess is correct, it should have been Evildoer Tie who placed it there.&#x201D; What Chu Feng had said was the truth. After becoming a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes had become even more powerful. He was able to see what other Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists could not.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
