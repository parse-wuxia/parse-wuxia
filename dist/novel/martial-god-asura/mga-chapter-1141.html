<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1141 - It&#x2019;s Me, What About It?</strong></p><p>Chu Feng did not bother with the crowd that gathered to watch what was going on. After he finished putting up the Asura Division&#x2019;s sign, he turned to Fang Tuohai and asked, &#x201C;Senior Fang, you said earlier that there were many other disciples from our Southern Cyanwood Forest that have yet to join a branch power organization. Is that the truth?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Absolutely true. How could I possibly lie to you about that? If you do not believe me, I am able to go and find them for you. Although they did not join our Smooth Steady Division, we still managed to keep in contact with them.&#x201D; Fang Tuohai nodded his head with absolute certainty. He feared that Chu Feng would not trust him.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. In that case, go and tell them that our Asura Division is willing to shelter them. As long as they want to join, they will be welcome to join at any time,&#x201D; said Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Got it. However, junior brother Chu Feng, since we have established the Asura Division, should we go and announce ourselves and recruit new members?&#x201D; asked Fang Tuohai.</p><p>&#x201C;The time is not yet ripe. There is no need for us to go and recruit new members yet. When the time is ripe, people will want to join us without us even bothering to recruit them. However, at that time, our Asura Division will no longer be a branch power organization that just anyone will be allowed to join.&#x201D; A confident smile appeared on Chu Feng&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Since he had established the Asura Division, he would most definitely not allow it to continue existing as an obscure and unknown entity...</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, if there is nothing that you need from me, I&#x2019;ll be returning first. Tomorrow, I&#x2019;ll see you at the mission plaza.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen took a glance at the gradually setting sun and then said to Chu Feng. Right after she said those words, she immediately turned around to leave the place.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait a moment.&#x201D; Chu Feng hurriedly shouted to stop Bai Ruochen. Then, he arrived beside her and said with a beaming smile. &#x201C;Lil Sis Ruochen, let me see you to your place.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why? I am not someone who cannot find her own residence.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen looked to Chu Feng with an alert expression. Without waiting for his response, she directly began to fly toward her own territory.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course I need to see you to your place; I still don&#x2019;t even know where your territory is yet.&#x201D; Chu Feng had an eagerly attentive expression. He turned to Wang Wei and the others, waved his hand and said. &#x201C;You all can disperse.&#x201D; After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng chased after Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s beautiful figure.</p><p>Although Bai Ruochen did not bother with Chu Feng, she also did not try to fly with all of her might. Thus, in no time, Chu Feng managed to catch up to her. He said. &#x201C;Lil Sis Ruochen, thank you for all the things you&#x2019;ve done today. I, Chu Feng, will remember your benevolence.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t understand what you&#x2019;re saying.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen cast a side eye at Chu Feng before turning to look forward with an expression of not knowing what Chu Feng was talking about.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Seeing this, Chu Feng did not try to explain himself. Instead, he laughed mischievously and then asked, &#x201C;You want me to go to the mission plaza tomorrow, it couldn&#x2019;t possibly be only so that we could go and do missions together, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course not. I have already inquired about the map that we obtained. It just happened to be the core disciple&#x2019;s mission region. In other words, we could use &#x2018;doing missions&#x2019; as a reason to explore the region on the map,&#x201D; said Bai Ruochen.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s such a good thing?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng was also delighted. That was because the map that Bai Ruochen spoke of was the true remnant left behind by the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s ancestor. Although neither Chu Feng nor Bai Ruochen knew what might be there, they were able to, at the very least, feel that it was most likely something of extraordinary value; at the very least, a treasure with great usage.</p><p>Otherwise, there shouldn&#x2019;t be a reason for the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s ancestor to go through all this effort of hiding it.</p><p>Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s territories were not located far from each other. With their fast traveling speed, they quickly arrived at their destination.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of the Ascension Sect, even in the Cyanwood Mountain, they possess extraordinary influence. This territory of yours, the daughter of the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s sectmaster, is quite a lot better than ours.&#x201D; After he saw Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s territory, Chu Feng gasped in admiration. That was because Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s territory was more than twice the size of his territory. In the territory, the buildings and other constructions were also extremely impressive and majestic. When compared to Chu Feng&#x2019;s territory, it appeared to be many times better.</p><p>&#x201C;How many times must I tell you this? I am not his daughter.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen corrected Chu Feng. Then, she stared fiercely at him and said. &#x201C;If you are to show your Commander Flag, the territory you would get would be more than several hundred times better than this one that I got here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Heh, I will take out the Commander Flag sooner or later. Merely, it is still not the time to do it yet. Aren&#x2019;t you the same? You still haven&#x2019;t gone to exchange your General Flag for the rewards.&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a mischievous laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;The General Flag is in my hands. It is mine and not something that others can take away. So why hurry?&#x201D; Bai Ruochen took a glance at the sky that had already grown dark and said. &#x201C;Well then, you&#x2019;ve already seen me to my territory. You can return now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen you back through this long journey, shouldn&#x2019;t you invite me in?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;For just a single man and a single woman, what purpose is there to invite?&#x201D; Bai Ruochen cast a side eye at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;How could it be a single man and a single woman? Are there no servants in your territory?&#x201D; said Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;While there are female servants in my territory, there are no males,&#x201D; said Bai Ruochen.</p><p>&#x201C;Is that so? In that case&#x2026; what&#x2019;s going on with those two?&#x201D; Chu Feng pointed to a small plaza in Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s territory.</p><p>&#x201C;That is?&#x201D; Following toward the direction that Chu Feng pointed at, Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s expression immediately changed. That was because two people were standing there. Furthermore, they were two men.</p><p>However, after Bai Ruochen managed to clearly see the appearances of these two men, she managed to calm down. She turned to Chu Feng and said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re my senior brothers from the Ascension Sect. To be exact, they&#x2019;re people from the Ascension Division.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You know them?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I do. They have returned to the Ascension Sect before. I met them during that time. However, I am merely acquainted with them and am not familiar with them,&#x201D; said Bai Ruochen.</p><p>&#x201C;I think that they have most likely come to act as a go-between. Let&#x2019;s go, I&#x2019;ll join you, let&#x2019;s see what they&#x2019;ll do,&#x201D; said Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen nodded and flew down together with Chu Feng. After arriving before them, she did not bother to call them senior brothers. Instead, with an icy-cold tone, she asked. &#x201C;Is there something that you need?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Junior sister Ruochen, you&#x2019;ve finally returned. We knew that some misunderstandings have occurred in the Ascension Division today. However, you cannot blame it on Long Chenfu. After all, our Ascension Division has its own rules.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, after our head and the second head heard about this matter, they immediately agreed to junior sister Ruochen&#x2019;s request. Head Long Chenyi even said that as long as junior sister Ruochen is willing to join the Ascension Division, not to mention the twenty-two disciples from the Southern Cyanwood Forest, even if twenty-two more disciples were to come, our Ascension Division will allow them to join without any delay.&#x201D; When those two men from the Ascension Division saw Bai Ruochen, they displayed very polite expressions toward her. However, the two of them did not even bother to take a glance at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need, I&#x2019;ve already joined another branch power organization.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen said with an indifferent tone.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Junior sister Ruochen, you&#x2019;ve joined another branch power organization? Which branch power organization did you join?!&#x201D; Upon hearing those words, the expressions of the two men immediately changed. Their expressions turned extremely ugly, as if they had eaten a dead rat,.</p><p>&#x201C;Can you not see it for yourselves?&#x201D; Bai Ruochen extended her lily-white hand and pointed to the armband on her right arm. On the armband were the words &#x2018;Asura Division.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;Asura Division?&#x201D; When they saw the words Asura Division, the two men displayed expressions of confusion.</p><p>After all, the two of them were veterans of the Cyanwood Mountain. Even in the Ascension Division, they were of the upper echelons. They could be said to be extremely knowledgeable of matters in the Cyanwood Mountain. Thus, they knew of all the powerful branch power organizations. However, the Asura Division was a division that they had never heard of before.</p><p>Yet, Bai Ruochen was wearing the Asura Division&#x2019;s armband. Evidently, it was not fake. However, regardless of who it was, they stole the genius Bai Ruochen from their Ascension Division. This caused them to be extremely unhappy and displeased. Thus, they asked. &#x201C;Junior sister Ruochen, may we know who the head of this Asura Division is?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s me, what about it?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
