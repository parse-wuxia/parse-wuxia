<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 894 - Mysterious Force</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; Xuan Xiaochao and the others were elated when they saw the Sixth Immortal was going to release them. They quickly urged Chu Feng to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">Right now, the Sixth Immortal had consumed Forbidden Medicine. His strength was too fierce, and not to mention Qiushui Fuyan alone, it was likely the combination of the Water King, the Fire King, </span><i><span style="">and </span></i><span style="">Qiushui Fuyan wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily be sufficient to defeat him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that instant, Chu Feng did not reply. He turned his head around and looked at Qiushui Fuyan.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing her pale complexion and white dress splattered with blood, in addition to the frightening bloody wound on her neck and face, Chu Feng remained silent. He slowly closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng wanted to prepare the Earthen Taboo martial skill and fight the Sixth Immortal in order to avenge Qiushui Fuyan.</span></p><p><span style="">*bam* However, Qiushui Fuyan hurriedly grabbed Chu Feng&#x2019;s wrist. After Chu Feng opened his eyes, she shook her head. Clearly, she had guessed Chu Feng&#x2019;s intentions and didn&#x2019;t want him to take the risk.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was instantly moved seeing the hints of pleading in her eyes. Indeed, the Sixth Immortal, in this instant, was too powerful. Chu Feng was not even sure whether his Firmament Slash would succeed. If it failed, then they were going to be in a horrible situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Quickly let my young master go! Otherwise, even if we all die together, I will make your death miserable!&#x201D; The Sixth Immortal panicked slightly when Chu Feng was still unwilling to let Murong Xun go.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if we all die together? With power such as yours?&#x201D; However, just at that moment, an aged voice rang out. An elderly figure simultaneously appeared in front of Chu Feng and the others.</span></p><p><span style="">It was an old man, nearly two meters tall, yet as thin as a stem of hemp. On his body, one could not feel the slightest trace of aura, as if he were not a cultivator but an ordinary commoner.</span></p><p><span style="">However, as he stood there in the air, there was this persistent feeling of abnormality because he had a very terrifying appearance&#x2014;his tall nose and dark green eyes made him seem like an old monster. If a child saw him, they would wail immediately. If an adult saw him, they would trip from fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master!&#x201D; But when he saw that old man appear, You Tonghan rejoiced and quickly went up to greet him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We pay our respects to Lord Protector!&#x201D; Not only did You Tonghan greet him, at that very instant, everyone else from the Crippling Night Demon Sect had faces full of joy as they half-knelt.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng too came to his senses after seeing their reaction. Quite evidently, that was You Tonghan&#x2019;s master, one of the Four Protectors of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, You Mingdeng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I pay my respects to Lord Protector!&#x201D; Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t hesitate after learning of that. He bent his knee, clasped his fists, and greeted the senior in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="">The Four Protectors were the strongest people within the Crippling Night Demon Sect. His strength was absolutely not something the Sixth Immortal stood a chance against. With him here, it didn&#x2019;t matter how many more Forbidden Medicines the Sixth Immortal consumed&#x2014;it would all be useless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You Mingdeng?&#x201D; As expected, after recognizing him, the face of Sixth Immortal and the two Protectors all turned green. Who was You Mingdeng? They were definitely no match for someone like him!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not bad, I haven&#x2019;t come too late. Everyone, rise.&#x201D; You Mingdeng turned around and looked at the crowd with a smile. However, he did not look at Qiushui Fuyan, nor at Chu Feng, as if ignoring them.</span></p><p><span style="">Qiushui Fuyan frowned at this small detail, but Chu Feng did not mind it too much. Along with You Tonghan and the others, he too stood up.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh* But just at that moment, the two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan rushed and became two streams of light, fleeing into the distance. They wanted to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Stay here for a while.&#x201D; You Mingdeng did not even turn his head around as they attempted to escape. With a thought, a golden Spirit Formation emerged and instantly sealed the two Protectors.</span></p><p><span style="">That Spirit Formation was really too powerful. No matter how they attacked, it would not shatter. In the end, they could only allow it to drift back and arrive in front of You Mingdeng.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* At the same time, another golden Spirit Formation emerged. It enveloped the Sixth Immortal who had yet to escape, and brought him forward towards You Mingdeng.</span></p><p><span style="">In front of him, the Sixth Immortal and the others, who were incomparably arrogant before, didn&#x2019;t even have any strength to escape. They were like a tortoise in a jar, and everyone else from the Crippling Night Demon Sect all had faces of satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="">You Tonghan even went up and asked, &#x201C;Master, how should they be dealt with?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring them all back. They will be of great use.&#x201D; As You Mingdeng spoke, he willed another golden Spirit Formation to appear, sealing Murong Xun who was in front of Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">No one presented any objections to his decision. Putting aside the fact that he had the most power at this very moment, his decision was very correct as well.</span></p><p><span style="">Just killing Murong Xun and the others would be too good for them. Other than diminishing a bit of the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s strength, there was no other meaning to it.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, perhaps there would be some use in leaving them alive. That was especially so for Murong Xun. He was the future master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago! It was likely no one in the Immortal Execution Archipelago wanted him to die.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid today, you may not take them away.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, just at that moment, a faint chuckle rang out in the sky. At the same time, two people soundlessly emerged, and stood above the Spirit Formation that bound Murong Xun.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone&#x2019;s expression changed greatly when they cast their gazes over. The ones who had come were two young males. Judging by their appearances, they were young men just slightly above twenty years of age. Yet, they were already Martial Kings.</span></p><p><span style="">One rank one Martial King, one rank two Martial King.</span></p><p><span style="">They not only possessed powerful strength, the clothings on their bodies were very special as well. There were talismans stuck all over, and even on their neck, there was a very long string of beads. They looked like some monks who were practitioners of evil, but due to their long black hair, they were clearly not monks.</span></p><p><span style="">However, something everyone felt was the indescribable aura of danger on those young men&#x2019;s bodies. Even Chu Feng, Qiushui Fuyan, and the others couldn&#x2019;t help but take a few steps back. Intuition told them to stay far away from those people.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, only You Mingdeng remained unmoving, standing in the distance. There weren&#x2019;t many changes to his expression, nor did he attack them immediately. He calmly asked, &#x201C;You are not from the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Why must you interfere in the conflict we have with them?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t need to care who we are, and we don&#x2019;t want to interfere in this conflict. However, right now, I want them to stay here.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You can choose to leave right now, and you can also chose to leave a few things behind before leaving.&#x201D; The rank two Martial King indifferently spoke. There was not the slightest hint of respect in his tone, and instead, there was a greatly superior feeling that came from it. He did not put You Mingdeng in his eyes at all.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
