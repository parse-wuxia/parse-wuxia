<p><strong>Chapter 2574 - Returning To The Hero City</strong></p><p>By relying on the title plate given to him by the Golden Crane True Immortal, Chu Feng was able to move the spirit formation guarding Wang Qiang.</p><p>As for the safest place right now, it would naturally be Hero City.</p><p>Although there was an enormous difference in strength between Ying Mingchao and the experts from the Upper Realms, very few people would likely be able to defeat Ying Mingchao.</p><p>At the very least, no one from the four tier one powers would be able to defeat Ying Mingchao.</p><p>To be exact, only three tier one powers remained. They were the Immortal Sword School, the Buddha&#x2019;s Heavenly Temple, and the Zhou Heavenly Clan.</p><p>Ever since Ying Mingchao reappeared in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and reestablished Hero City, everyone felt that Hero City would become one of the most formidable powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Merely with Ying Mingchao alone, Hero City would be able to vie for supremacy in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>On the journey back, Chu Feng did not say anything&#x2026;</p><p>When Chu Feng returned to Hero City, it was bustling with even more noise and excitement than when he had left.</p><p>Not only were more and more powers arriving at Hero City to request to become allies with it, but practically all of the remnants from the previous Hero City had returned.</p><p>At that moment Ying Mingchao was no longer the only True Immortal in Hero City. Chu Feng was able to sense three more True Immortal-level experts in Hero City apart from Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Chu Feng had never felt the auras of those three True Immortals before.</p><p>Thus, three True Immortals that he had never met before had arrived in the Hero City.</p><p>After Chu Feng finished settling Wang Qiang, he was called to Hero City&#x2019;s main palace by Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Inside the main palace hall, Chu Feng met with the former members of Hero City. At the same time, he also met those three True Immortals.</p><p>One of them wore pure white clothes. Although he had the appearance of a middle-aged man, as he had lived for over a thousand years, he gave off a very mature aura, a special sort of air. It was something that could only be obtained through trials and experience.</p><p>That person was not a former member of Hero City. Rather, he was a Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&#x2019;s genius.</p><p>When that genius was young, he had deeply admired Ying Mingchao, and had always wanted to join Hero City.</p><p>Merely, when he had just managed to attain success in his cultivation, Ying Mingchao suffered a calamity, and Hero City was subsequently destroyed.</p><p>Afterwards, he entered the mountains and started to seclude himself in closed-door training. In the thousand-plus years that Ying Mingchao was gone, no one knew of his existence. However, during that period of time, his cultivation had reached the True Immortal realm, becoming one of the peak experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Originally, he had planned to spend the rest of his life as a hermit until his death. However, upon hearing the news of Ying Mingchao being alive, he immediately rushed toward Hero City.</p><p>As he had been in closed-door training the entire time, practically no one in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm knew of him.</p><p>However, his name would soon become renowned through the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As for that, it was for none other than the fact that he was a True Immortal.</p><p>After being introduced by Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng came to know that the man was called Li Haoyang.</p><p>Apart from Li Haoyang, the other two True Immortals were former members of Hero City.</p><p>Like Li Haoyang, the two of them were both rank one True Immortals. However, they were much older than Li Haoyang.</p><p>They were both people that had lived for thousands of years. One of them had the appearance of a white-haired old man. He gave off an extraordinary air. He wore a snow white gown, and held a jade white scepter. His appearance truly resembled that of an actual immortal.</p><p>The title of &#x2018;True Immortal&#x2019; was extremely fitting for him.</p><p>Compared to that old man, the other individual was the polar opposite of the title of &#x2018;True Immortal.&#x2019;</p><p>Even though he was clearly an old monster that had lived for thousands of years, that person had the appearance of a youngster. His height was not even a hundred and fifty centimeters. In fact, a childish nature filled his face. There was not the slightest trace of maturity from being alive for so long.<br>[1. 150cm is around 4.9ft.]</p><p>Furthermore, it seemed that that man disliked Chu Feng a lot.</p><p>The people present, regardless of whether they were former members of Hero City or newly-joined members, all revealed a good-natured expression upon seeing Chu Feng.</p><p>They all knew that it was all thanks to Chu Feng that Ying Mingchao had managed to escape.</p><p>Ying Mingchao had been saying without the slightest hesitation to others that Chu Feng had saved him.</p><p>This was something that practically everyone knew. Thus&#x2026; the people from Hero City all felt a great amount of respect toward Chu Feng.</p><p>However, that True Immortal with a youngster&#x2019;s appearance was looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with hatred. It was as if Chu Feng owed him money, or had stolen something from him.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, let me introduce you. These two people are both my good brothers, and have gone through fire and water with me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This person here is Bai Liuxu,&#x201D; Ying Mingchao pointed to the white-clothed old man. Then, he pointed to the True Immortal with a youngster&#x2019;s appearance, &#x201C;As for him, he&#x2019;s Lil Ball.&#x201D;<br>[2. Technically&#x2026; little leather/rubber ball.]</p><p>&#x201C;When Lil&#x2019; Ball was young, he encountered a fortuitous meeting. It allowed his talent for martial cultivation to greatly increase. Yet, it made it so that his appearance remained unchanged. He will forever remain with a youngster&#x2019;s appearance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, Lil&#x2019; Ball has been with me since my bandit days. He is my sworn brother.&#x201D;</p><p>Ying Mingchao spoke with an especially intimate tone when introducing Lil&#x2019; Ball. From this, it could be seen that the two of them possessed quite a deep relationship.</p><p>After that, Ying Mingchao began to introduce all the people present to Chu Feng one by one.</p><p>Then, Ying Mingchao walked over to Chu Feng. With a smile on his face, he said to the crowd, &#x201C;As for this person, I believe I do not have to introduce him to everyone. He is my benefactor, the person that saved me, my brother Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s name has already spread through the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm when our Lord City Master was still trapped. Thus, this Bai Liuxu naturally knew of you already,&#x201D; Bai Liuxu walked over to Chu Feng and actually half kneeled on the ground to express a grand salute to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, what are you doing?&#x201D; Chu Feng was greatly alarmed upon seeing this scene. He hurriedly moved forward to help Bai Liuxu back up.</p><p>However, that Bai Liuxu was unwilling to move in the slightest. He said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Our Lord City Master was harmed by crafty scoundrels. Had it not been for brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s righteous rescue, we would have had no idea when we would be able to meet our Lord City Master again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, not only are you the savior of our Lord Clan Chief, but you are also the savior of our Hero City. I, Bai Liuxu, will never forget brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s grace.&#x201D;</p><p>It turned out that this Bai Liuxu made such a respectful gesture toward Chu Feng out of gratefulness toward Chu Feng for saving Ying Mingchao.</p><p>From that, it could be seen that he was not only loyal and devoted to Ying Mingchao, but he also feel great sentiment toward Ying Mingchao. Otherwise, he would not have done such a thing.</p><p>&#x201C;I have also heard of Chu Feng&#x2019;s distinguished name. You nearly extinguished the Kong Heavenly Clan by yourself. This one is truly in admiration.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely&#x2026;&#x201D; Right at that moment, that man by the name of Lil&#x2019; Ball began to walk toward Chu Feng.</p><p>Seeing the eccentric behavior of that Lil&#x2019; Ball, Chu Feng felt slightly annoyed. Thus, he said, &#x201C;It would be fine to speak your mind without reservations.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, you knew that my elder brother was trapped two years ago. Why did you not save my elder brother two years ago?&#x201D; Lil&#x2019; Ball asked.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you trying to say?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Nothing much. I am merely skeptical of your rumored heaven-defying strength,&#x201D; Lil&#x2019; Ball said to Chu Feng.</p><p>He was looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with contempt.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
