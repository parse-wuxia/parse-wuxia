<p><strong> Chapter 2420 - Must Kill Chu Feng</strong></p><p>Inside the most extravagant and grand palace of the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>Not only were Kong Shunlian and Kong Moyu present, but even the other two Utmost Exalted Elders who were still in closed-door training had appeared as well.</p><p>At that moment, other than Kong Yuehua, four of the five Utmost Exalted Elders were all present.</p><p>Furthermore, practically all of the peak Martial Ancestor-level experts of the Kong Heavenly Clan were gathered here too.</p><p>Their gazes were all fixed on a single person inside the palace hall.</p><p>It was a white-haired old man with tidy clothes.</p><p>While that individual had the appearance of an old man, he emitted an extraordinary aura, the aura of a king.</p><p>Most importantly, not only was that old man a True Immortal-level expert, his aura was also much more powerful than Kong Shunlian&#x2019;s or Kong Moyu&#x2019;s.</p><p>He&#x2026; was a rank two True Immortal.</p><p>As for that man, he was none other than the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, Kong Jitian.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, if the inheritance has truly been snatched, this is definitely no small matter. This old man is willing to personally enter the Grief Calamity Mountain Range to capture that intruder,&#x201D; Kong Moyu said to the clan chief.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The intruder triggered a slaughtering formation and died,&#x201D; Right at that moment, Kong Yuehua walked in.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Yuehua, is what you said the truth?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Absolutely. The change to the ancient pagoda&#x2019;s spirit formation will not be mistaken. The intruder was indeed killed by a slaughtering formation,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said.</p><p>&#x201C;If he is really dead, wouldn&#x2019;t it mean that the inheritance Lord Primogenitor left for us has also been&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Truly, damn it!&#x201D; Kong Moyu felt endless heartache when he thought about the fact that the inheritance might have disappeared along with that intruder.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Moyu, don&#x2019;t be too pessimistic. Although an abnormal sign appeared in the sky, it does not necessarily mean that the intruder managed to seize our inheritance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since that intruder was actually killed by the slaughtering formation, it means that his abilities were not that heaven-defying either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Primogenitor is, after all, our Lord Primogenitor. We must be confident in him,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026; it is still possible that the inheritance has been snatched, no?&#x201D; Kong Moyu was still worried.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, regardless of whether or not the inheritance has been snatched, it remains that an intruder has trespassed into our Grief Calamity Mountain Range. This is no small matter. We must definitely strengthen the defenses around the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. Lord Clan Chief, please make a decision,&#x201D; Kong Moyu said to their Lord Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that intruder has died, we will leave this matter to the side for now. It will not be too late for us to discuss this again later. The reason for that is because, compared to the inheritance being snatched or not, I have something more important that I must discuss with everyone,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>Once he said those words, the expressions of the crowd present all changed.</p><p>An outsider getting into their Grief Calamity Mountain Range was no small matter at all. Yet, their Lord Clan Chief actually declared that there was something more important than that. As such, how could they not be startled?</p><p>Furthermore, their Lord Clan Chief had such a serious expression on his face right now.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, what sort of matter might it be?&#x201D; Someone asked worriedly.</p><p>&#x201C;It concerns our Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s continued existence,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said with a stern expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Concerns out Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s&#x2026;. continued existence?!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Once the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief declared those words, the expressions of the elders all changed enormously. Some among them were so frightened by those words that their complexions turned blue, and their bodies started shivering.</p><p>For it to concern the continued existence of the Kong Heavenly Clan, this was definitely an enormous matter.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, do you all remember that Grandmaster Prophet had declared that in the next hundred years, an exceptional genius would appear in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and that said genius will bring about our Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s destruction?&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;We naturally remember that. But, wasn&#x2019;t it declared that the exceptional genius was Young Master Li Ming?&#x201D; Someone said.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Master Li Ming is the person we guessed to be that exceptional genius. However, Grandmaster Prophet has not managed to prophesy the name of that genius.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However now, Grandmaster Prophet has managed to prophesize who will cause the destruction of our Kong Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Who?&#x201D; The crowd asked in unison.</p><p>As that individual concerned the continued existence of the Kong Heavenly Clan, as long as they knew who that individual was, the people present would definitely disregard their lives and put everything on the line to eliminate that individual.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the expressions of many of the people present changed.</p><p>However, in terms of who was shocked the most, it would be none other than Kong Shunlian.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, are you certain about this? Little friend Chu Feng does not seem to possess any enmity toward our Kong Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;I left so urgently this time around because Grandmaster Prophet wanted to meet me. He indicated that he had prophesied that the person who would bring about the destruction of our Kong Heavenly Clan was Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Till this date, when has Grandmaster Prophet ever failed in a prophecy?&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked.</p><p>&#x201C;But, Lord Clan Chief, little friend Chu Feng is an honored guest invited over by our Kong Heavenly Clan. Must we really kill him?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm knows that little friend Chu Feng is staying in our Kong Heavenly Clan as a guest. If we are to kill him, what will the people of the world think of our Kong Heavenly Clan?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, it is not as if Chu Feng does not possess a backer. Everyone, do you all still remember the old monk that appeared in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>Actually, Kong Shunlian had not been present when the plain-clothed monk had appeared to back Chu Feng.</p><p>However, as of now, that matter was something that the Kong Heavenly Clan and the other three tier one powers knew very well.</p><p>They all knew that standing behind Chu Feng was a plain-clothed old monk, a True Immortal-level expert.</p><p>Actually, the reason why the Kong Heavenly Clan had tried so hard to invite Chu Feng over that day was precisely so that they could pull a relationship with Chu Feng&#x2019;s True Immortal-level backer.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng is indeed a rare genius. Back then, I ordered you to invite him precisely so that we could rope him in.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That is also precisely the reason why I gathered everyone here to discuss this,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, there&#x2019;s no need for discussion. Since we are certain that Chu Feng will be a threat to our clan, we should directly kill him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So what if he possesses a True Immortal backer? Our Kong Heavenly Clan has existed for so many years, since when have we not had True Immortals?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, after killing Chu Feng, we can put a crime on his face. For example, we can forcibly declare him to be the intruder.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back then, we were even able to erase that Ying Mingchao and his Hero City, and make it so that no one dared to mention them again within a thousand years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could the current Chu Feng possibly be even more popular with the masses than Ying Mingchao from back then? Could he possibly be stronger than Hero City?&#x201D; Kong Moyu asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. Since Grandmaster Prophet has already prophesied that Chu Feng will bring a disaster upon our Kong Heavenly Clan, we absolutely cannot let him live,&#x201D; The crowd began to voice their agreement.</p><p>&#x201C;But, Chu Feng is different from Ying Mingchao. The Ying Mingchao from back then already had the intention to rule over the world. Furthermore, he declared that he would eliminate our Kong Heavenly Clan. He was someone who really did pose a threat to our Kong Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the current Chu Feng, he does not harbor any malice towards our Kong Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, we can only be certain that plain-clothed old monk is a True Immortal, and cannot be certain as to how powerful he really is. What if he is not a rank one True Immortal?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if he might be a rank two True Immortal, so what? Our Lord Clan Chief is also a rank two True Immortal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, we also possess the Zhou Heavenly Clan as our allies. Although our relationship is not as good as before, the Zhou Heavenly Clan will definitely not refuse to help us during this moment of our life and death. Don&#x2019;t forget, we are on the same boat,&#x201D; Kong Moyu said firmly.</p><p>&#x201C;What Elder Moyu says is reasonable,&#x201D; The crowd nodded their heads to express their agreement.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that everyone has come to a decision,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, there&#x2019;s no need to hesitate. Kill that Chu Feng,&#x201D; The crowd said in unison.</p><p>At that moment, Kong Shunlian&#x2019;s heart tightened. He hurriedly asked, &#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, are you really determined to kill Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Shunlian, I know that you are the one who invited Chu Feng over. Now that we want to kill Chu Feng, it will indeed place you in a very difficult situation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, this matter concerns the continued existence of our clan. As such, I have no other options.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng must be killed. Even if we are to have our reputation swept away, he must still be killed. Even if he possesses a powerful backer, he must still be killed. He absolutely cannot be left alive.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And now, he is actually in our Kong Heavenly Clan as a guest. This is the best opportunity to kill him. We absolutely cannot miss it,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, this subordinate requests that he be allowed to go and kill Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, I will go and kill Chu Feng right now.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that their Lord Clan Chief was determined to kill Chu Feng, countless voices requesting permission to kill Chu Feng sounded in the palace hall.</p><p>However, right at that moment, Kong Shunlian&#x2019;s voice sounded again. &#x201C;Since I am the one who invited Chu Feng over, I should be the one to settle his life.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
