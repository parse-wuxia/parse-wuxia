<p><strong> Chapter 2278 - A Sinister Laugh</strong></p><p>Everyone was startled by Chu Feng&#x2019;s acceptance of the conditions.</p><p>It was not because they felt that Chu Feng would definitely lose.</p><p>This was especially true for the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others. They all knew how strong Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques were.</p><p>They felt that Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques were very strong, that even though he had only just become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he possessed the strength to compete against Daoist Gold Star.</p><p>They were only feeling confused because they felt that Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s demands were truly irrational. Yet, Chu Feng had actually agreed to them.</p><p>In this sort of situation, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui involuntarily glanced at one another.</p><p>After glancing at one another, they seemed to have reached a mutual understanding. They then looked to Chu Feng. The confusion in their eyes had disappeared and was replaced with admiration.</p><p>They both felt a possibility. That was that Chu Feng had dared to agree to those demands because he possessed the certainty of absolute victory. At the very least, he was very confident in himself.</p><p>It was precisely because of the confidence that Chu Feng possessed that the two grand characters felt admiration for Chu Feng.</p><p>They felt that the young needed that sort of drive.</p><p>&#x201C;This is truly what they meant by a newborn calf not being afraid of tigers. Since you have decided, we can start,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, how do you want to compete?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;How to compete? We shall fight with world spirit techniques until one is defeated,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star said.</p><p>&#x201C;Until one is defeated? What sort of &#x2018;defeat&#x2019; do you mean?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It means me beating you to a state of being unable to fight back,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star said.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re planning to use world spirit techniques to compete in an actual battle against Chu Feng?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley master and the other spectators all revealed astonished expressions.</p><p>&#x201C;Precisely,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t really fair, no?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked.</p><p>&#x201C;How is it not fair?&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star asked coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Your cultivation is, after all, that of a rank six Martial Ancestor, whereas little friend Chu Feng is only a rank four Half Martial Ancestor. With how enormous the difference in your cultivations is, how could the two of you possibly battle with world spirit techniques?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star smiled lightly. He said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s something that you all are ignorant about. I am going to use world spirit techniques to fight against him. I am not using my martial power. So why would my cultivation possibly matter?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Su Jingrui said, &#x201C;Everyone knows that a world spiritist&#x2019;s cultivation directly decides the strength of a world spiritist. After all, a world spiritist will also need a powerful build.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although we are not Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, we are, after all, Royal-cloak World Spiritists. As such, we know about that sort of thing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So what? It is he who wants to challenge me. Are you saying that I cannot utilize my advantage?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, I might as well not compete. I&#x2019;ll just admit defeat, okay? After all, no matter what I do, you&#x2019;ll all say that I&#x2019;m the one in the wrong. Isn&#x2019;t that right?&#x201D; After Daoist Gold Star finished saying those words, he looked to the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster and said, &#x201C;Headmaster Ouyang, how about we just leave? After all, it seems that your two old friends are unable to take a defeat with grace.&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster had a wry smile on his face. He actually also deeply disliked Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s attitude.</p><p>However, it remained that Daoist Gold Star was someone that he requested help from. Furthermore, he had exhausted a great amount of effort in order to invite Daoist Gold Star here.</p><p>At that moment, he was placed in a very difficult situation because he did not wish to offend either side.</p><p>&#x201C;It turns out, only I alone am an outsider. You&#x2019;re also with them,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star was able to see through the attitude of the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster. Thus, he felt increasingly angry and displeasure filled his face.</p><p>In response, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster hurriedly tried to explain. &#x201C;Brother Gold Star, you&#x2019;re overthinking things. How could you be an outsider? This is merely a friendly spar. It&#x2019;s not as serious as you think it is.&#x201D;</p><p>However, before he could finish, Daoist Gold Star laughed coldly. Then, he said, &#x201C;Ouyang Yuqing, you know best why I agreed to come here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I did not fancy the rewards that you gave me. Instead, it was because I, Gold Star, and your Three Stars Hall both possessed the word &#x2018;star.&#x2019; As such, I considered it fate.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It was because of that fate that I decided to help you. Else, did you really think that bit of reward you gave me would be enough to make an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist help you?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster revealed a displeased expression. He said, &#x201C;Gold Star, are your words not too excessive?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You have not come here for free. It was also you who declared how much you wanted to be paid. Furthermore, I had already given you your rewards.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yet now, you are actually saying those things to me? Do you really think it is appropriate?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To put it pleasantly, I have requested your presence here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, to put it bluntly, you were merely hired by me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is there someone who speaks to an employer the way you&#x2019;re speaking to me?&#x201D;</p><p>Anger. The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster&#x2019;s tone was filled with anger. Furthermore, it was also very imposing.</p><p>He had revealed all of the displeasure he felt earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Pah! I gave you face, and you really considered yourself to be someone grand?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is your pay. Today, your daddy I will return it to you. From this point on, your daddy I am not related to you in the slightest.&#x201D;</p><p>Daoist Gold Star was truly not someone to be trifled with. He took out a Cosmos Sack and tossed it at the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster.</p><p>As for the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster, he was not one to be polite either. Not only did he receive the Cosmos Sack, he also opened it to check its contents carefully.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s missing twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;I have accompanied you here and wasted a lot of my time. Those twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments are my compensation,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star said.</p><p>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you declare earlier that you didn&#x2019;t care about this bit of reward? That you&#x2019;ve come here because of fate? Why is there a compensation fee now?&#x201D; Su Jingrui mocked.</p><p>At that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others present, even Chu Feng and the others of the younger generation, started to sneer.</p><p>While Daoist Gold Star might appear to be an extraordinary individual, he was actually extremely petty. He was indeed someone to be sneered at.</p><p>&#x201C;Good, very good.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Three Stars Hall, Sunset Cloud Valley, I, Daoist Gold Star, will remember you all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You all will soon know the consequences for going against me, Daoist Gold Star, are.&#x201D;</p><p>Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s expression began to distort. However, in the end, he still took out twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments and tossed them at the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster.</p><p>Upon seeing the twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart started to move. The reason for that was because those twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments were all of extraordinary quality.</p><p>They could be said to be top quality Incomplete Ancestral Armaments. In fact, their quality even slightly surpassed Chu Feng&#x2019;s Magma Emperor Sword.</p><p>It was no wonder Daoist Gold Star would return everything but keep the twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments.</p><p>&#x201C;I will not bother seeing you off then,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said after putting the twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments away.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need for you all to see me off,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star snorted coldly. Then, he waved his sleeve and prepared to swagger off.</p><p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly said, &#x201C;Why are you leaving? Could it be that you are afraid of competing?&#x201D;</p><p>Daoist Gold Star stopped his footsteps. He turned around and asked, &#x201C;What? You still want to compete against me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I never declared that I would not compete with you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Hah&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, that Daoist Gold Star burst into laughter. Merely, his laughter was very sinister. It caused one to shiver upon hearing it.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
