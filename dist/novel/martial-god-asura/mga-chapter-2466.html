<p><strong> Chapter 2466 - Akin To Legend</strong></p><p>&#x201C;It seems that you all have admitted to it. Was what happened back then truly as Young Hero Chu Feng said?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Repaying kindness with malice, this is truly repaying kindness with malice!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Young Hero Chu Feng had saved you all, yet you&#x2019;ve actually repaid his kindness with malice! You all&#x2026; do you all even possess humanity?!&#x201D;</p><p>Zhan Yuanmo was so furious that his face turned deathly pale. Even his body started to shiver.</p><p>Suddenly, his body stiffened, and his mouth opened.</p><p>&#x201C;Pfff~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A large mouthful of blood sprayed out of his mouth. The next moment, he was unable to stand firm, and began to fall toward the ground.</p><p>Fortunately, Chu Feng was quick to react. His body immediately moved, arriving before Zhan Yuanmo to support him, preventing him from falling to the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Father&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Milord!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We are wrong. Please punish us severely. Milord, please don&#x2019;t get angry and bring harm upon yourself.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Zhan Yuanmo actually vomited blood out of anger, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were all deeply frightened.</p><p>&#x201C;Severely punish? Indeed, you all should be severely punished. You bunch of ingrates should be punished with death!!!&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo said furiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Death?&#x201D; Upon hearing that word, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen all turned ashen with fear. They stood there as if petrified.</p><p>Some among them felt their legs grow weak and fell onto their butts, a stunned expression on their faces.</p><p>They had all anticipated that Zhan Yuanmo would punish them severely upon hearing about the matter. However, they never expected for him to bring up the subject of death as a punishment.</p><p>As they knew very well what sort of temperament Zhan Yuanmo possessed, they knew that he was never someone to joke around. Since he declared that they should be punished with death, it meant that&#x2026; he would likely really end up killing them.</p><p>&#x201C;Milord, we know our wrongs. Please, please show us leniency and spare our lives.&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, all kinds of begging voices could be heard. Not to mention the people that made things difficult for Chu Feng that day, even the siblings Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong started to beg for forgiveness.</p><p>Naturally, they were pleading for their father, their siblings, and their seniors.</p><p>The two of them both anticipated that their grandfather would punish their father and the others. However, they never expected for the punishment to be so severe.</p><p>&#x201C;You all still have the nerve to beg for forgiveness? If it wasn&#x2019;t for Young Hero Chu Feng saving you all twice, you would have already died twice by now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As your lives were already saved twice by Young Hero Chu Feng, your lives are already no longer yours. Rather, they belong to Young Hero Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yet, you all&#x2026; actually imprisoned him. Tell me, where did your humanity go?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How have I taught you all? Did the benevolence and righteousness that I taught you all go to the stomachs of dogs?&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo pointed to the War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the others with his shivering hand as he snarled his questions furiously.</p><p>He was truly furious. At the same time, he was utterly disappointed and ashamed. After all, those people were his clansmen, people that he had nurtured.</p><p>Being reprimanded by Zhan Yuanmo in such a manner, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen grew quiet. They stopped begging for forgiveness.</p><p>Some among them started to gnash their teeth, some started to tightly clench their fists, and some started to slap themselves. There were also those that started weeping bitter tears.</p><p>However, regardless of what sort of reaction they had, they all felt the same sort of thing -- regret!!!</p><p>Regret, they were truly regretful.</p><p>They regretted their conduct and deeds back then.</p><p>Especially after they saw how Chu Feng did not attack them, and instead drove away the Monstrous Clan to save their War Clan even though he possessed such overwhelming power, they were truly filled with endless regret.</p><p>They discovered that they were so petty, low and narrow-minded when compared to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, forget about it. What happened has already happened. Furthermore, I am fine. Thus, it would suffice to just give them a warning. There is really no need to actually punish them.&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke with a smile on his face.</p><p>At that moment, not only did Zhan Yuanmo reveal a stunned expression, but the other War Clansmen also revealed stunned expressions.</p><p>They all felt that Chu Feng had mentioned the matter so that they would be punished.</p><p>Yet, why did Chu Feng suddenly start pleading for leniency for them right when they were about to be punished?</p><p>They were truly unable to understand exactly what Chu Feng was thinking.</p><p>Seemingly able to guess what the crowd was confused about, Chu Feng stood up with a smile on his face. He said, &#x201C;Originally, I had never thought about doing anything to you all. Merely, earlier, not a single one of you bothered to try to provide an explanation for what had happened to me back then. Furthermore, you all even tried to conceal the truth, tried to let things pass on just like this. As such, I could not accept it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The reason for that is because your actions were nothing more than evasion. And that, is not a good thing at all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, you mean to say that you actually&#x2026; never planned to take revenge?&#x201D; At that moment, Zhan Lingtong stood forth.</p><p>What Zhan Lingtong asked was actually what the others in the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan wanted to ask too.</p><p>&#x201C;My little brother Lingtong, if I had wanted to take revenge, why would I have bothered to take care of the Monstrous Clan today?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Have you forgotten what I told you two years ago when I stepped into the Martial Comprehension Ground?&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Zhan Lingtong with a smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;No, I haven&#x2019;t. I naturally remember it. That&#x2019;s right, big brother Chu Feng has never considered our War Clan as enemies.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even back then when Lord Father and the seniors insisted on imprisoning big brother Chu Feng, he never thought about retaliating against everyone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, big brother Chu Feng said that if the Monstrous Clan were to come and invade, that I must definitely inform him, and he would definitely come down to help us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng kept his promise. When I pinched the title plate big brother Chu Feng gave me that day, he really appeared immediately.&#x201D;</p><p>When Zhan Lingtong said those words, he had an immensely proud expression on his face. After all, he felt that if he hadn&#x2019;t pinched the title plate, Chu Feng might not have appeared. At that time, their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan would have been destined to be extinguished.</p><p>Actually, Zhan Lingtong spoke those words not only so that he could show off to the crowd, but he was also trying to inform the War Clansmen as to what sort of individual Chu Feng was.</p><p>Sure enough, after hearing what Zhan Lingtong said, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen all revealed even more obviously ashamed and guilty expressions.</p><p>The more magnanimous Chu Feng was, the more it set off how narrow-minded and petty they were.</p><p>The more sentimental and righteous Chu Feng was, the more it set off how ungrateful and unjust they were.</p><p>&#x201C;Martial Comprehension Ground?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t Young Hero Chu Feng trapped in the prison cell the entire time? When did he ascend to the Martial Comprehension Ground?&#x201D; Suddenly, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked with a questioning expression on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true?&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the other elders also managed to react. They too revealed dumbfounded expressions.</p><p>During the past two years, they had been to the prison cell that Chu Feng was held in many a time to urge him to renounce their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword.</p><p>Logically, it shouldn&#x2019;t be possible for Chu Feng to have ascended to the Martial Comprehension Ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. Lord Father, seniors, when mentioning it, you all might not believe me. However, that prison cell is simply unable to hold my big brother Chu Feng,&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong spoke proudly.</p><p>&#x201C;How could it not hold Young Hero Chu Feng? I&#x2019;ve seen Young Hero Chu Feng in the prison cell many times, and have even conversed with him,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha. My dear Lord Father, the person you met was simply not my big brother Chu Feng. Rather, it was merely my big brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s clone,&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong spoke with a loud laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;Clone? It was merely a clone? Impossible! That was most definitely not a clone,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief refused to believe it.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Father, the one trapped in the prison cell is indeed a clone,&#x201D; Right at that moment, Zhan Lingling also spoke.</p><p>&#x201C;But, how could a clone be that life-like? It is simply no different from Young Hero Chu Feng, it is simply a carbon copy,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;It would naturally be impossible for ordinary world spiritists to create clones that lifelike. However, Young Hero Chu Feng is capable. The reason for that is because&#x2026; he&#x2019;s an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&#x201D; Zhan Lingling said.</p><p>&#x201C;Immortal-cloak World Spiritist!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Young Hero Chu Feng is actually&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s actually an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Once Zhan Lingling said those words, they came like an explosion to the crowd&#x2019;s ears, and caused them to burst into an uproar.</p><p>The reason for that was because, other than their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s ancestor and their senior Zhan Haichuan, there had never been anyone else who had managed to reach the level of Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>To them, Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were akin to legends.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
