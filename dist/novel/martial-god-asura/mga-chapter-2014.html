<p><strong> Chapter 2014 - Snow Blade Mad Demon&#x2019;s Past</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng had not wanted to disturb the Snow Blade Mad Demon. However, right at the moment when Chu Feng planned to leave, the Snow Blade Mad Demon suddenly noticed him.</p><p>In response, Chu Feng immediately descended beside Snow Blade Mad Demon and asked, &#x201C;Senior, you are&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;These are all for my family. Today is the anniversary of their deaths. Thus, I am holding an offering to them here,&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon wiped his tears away and forced a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;The anniversary of their deaths?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed.</p><p>With this many memorial tablets, it was clear that it was an entire family, a clan. The Snow Blade Mad Demon said that it was the anniversary of their deaths. This meant that his family had all died on the same day.</p><p>There could only be one possibility for why this many people had died on the same day-- they were killed.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, who killed them?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked in a serious manner.</p><p>&#x201C;It was Zhan Cangtian,&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon responded.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhan Cangtian? Are you talking about the leader of the Five Great Evildoers, that Zhan Cangtian?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked to confirm.</p><p>&#x201C;Other than him, who else would do something so cruel?&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, exactly what happened?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Back then, Zhan Cangtian was yet to be infamous throughout the world. I was also young. As I traveled the world, I accidently came across Zhan Cangtian doing an evil deed. He was trying to massacre a family. Seeing that the family was not full of malicious people, I acted to prevent Zhan Cangtian from ruthlessly killing them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As we fought, he was no match for me. After being injured by me, he suddenly asked whether or not I dared to declare my name to him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, I thought that since he was no match for me, and that I would be killing him on the spot, even if I were to tell him where my family was, I would still not have anything to worry about.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As such, I ended up telling him my name. However, never did I expect that Zhan Cangtian was actually a world spiritist, and possessed a treasure on him. Using that treasure&#x2019;s power, he managed to escape from me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After he escaped, I did not concern myself about it too much. However, when I returned home, I discovered that all the people in my family had been killed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That day, my oldest son was only four and a half years old,&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon gently caressed a memorial tablet with shaking hands.</p><p>&#x201C;As for my younger son,&#x201D; Then, Snow Blade Mad Demon looked to another memorial tablet. Glistening teardrops appeared in his aged eyes once again. With a trembling voice, he said, &#x201C;he was only a month old newborn. I did not even have the chance to see him since he was born.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yet, my first meeting with him would be his corpse that was hacked into eight pieces. Not even an intact corpse remained.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, all of my family&#x2019;s young women, before they were killed, they were all raped by Zhan Cangtian. Especially my wife and my little sister, they&#x2026;&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon started to choke with emotions.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; Hearing those words, coldness filled Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. Even though Snow Blade Mad Demon had not finished his words, Chu Feng was able to guess that not only were his wife and little sister raped, they had most certainly also met miserable deaths.</p><p>Chu Feng detested those who bullied women, children and the elderly the most. That Zhan Cangtian could be said to have killed all that he shouldn&#x2019;t have. Furthermore, he killed them in such a cruel manner.</p><p>Furthermore, that was only what Zhan Cangtian did to the Snow Blade Mad Demon. Over the years, the people that Zhan Cangtian had killed were innumerable. One could very well imagine how numerous his malicious deeds were.</p><p>Evildoer, he was most definitely an enormous evildoer. His crimes could not be forgiven.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, did you search for Zhan Cangtian later?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I have; how could I not? Ever since that day, I have remained unmarried, and did not bother to come into dealings with others. Other than training, the only thing I did was search for Zhan Cangtian.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, never would I have expected for my search to be this long. It has been thousands of years, but I have yet to find Zhan Cangtian,&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon said.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be? Isn&#x2019;t Zhan Cangtian the leader of the Five Great Evildoers? He should have done countless malicious deeds over the years. Furthermore, he also has a disciple. How could there be no trace leading to him?&#x201D; Chu Feng found it very unbelievable.</p><p>The Snow Blade Mad Demon was a very old man. Furthermore, his family being massacred by Zhan Cangtian had happened when he was young. This meant that he had searched for Zhan Cangtian his entire life, yet was unable to find him. Furthermore, in this period of time, Zhan Cangtian had continued to do malicious deeds in the Holy Land of Martialism. This was truly unbelievable.</p><p>&#x201C;He has appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism countless times. With every single appearance, he would do something so evil that it would cause people&#x2019;s hair to stand up in anger. After he finished his malicious deeds, he would leave his name behind. However, he would never leave any clues that would lead to him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When I first met him, he was still a nameless and obscure individual. However, he has now become extremely notorious, the leader of the Five Great Evildoers, whose infamy is known throughout the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The innocents that were killed by him are simply too many to count. Even the family that I saved from Zhan Cangtian the first time I encountered him ended up being killed by him later. Furthermore, their deaths were like&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That is why I detest myself for being incompetent,&#x201D; Resentment filled the Snow Blade Mad Demon&#x2019;s eyes. It was not only hatred toward Zhan Cangtian. There was an equal amount of hatred for himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;ve met him, you should know his appearance, right? You can tell me his appearance, I&#x2019;ll help you search for him,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>After hearing about what Zhan Cangtian had done, Chu Feng felt that he absolutely could not be forgiven. As long as Chu Feng knew of his appearance, even if that was his appearance when he was young, Chu Feng would be able to recognize Zhan Cangtian when he saw him.</p><p>&#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t. When I first met him, he was wearing a mask. I simply do not know what he looks like.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In fact, simply no one knows what Zhan Cangtian looks like,&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon said.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be?&#x201D; Chu Feng was extremely shocked. Then, he sighed in his heart, &#x2018;It would appear that Zhan Cangtian is a very cautious person. He conceals his appearance when he plans to do malicious deeds. This is indeed hard to deal with.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;However, little friend Chu Feng, as long as I am still alive, there will be a chance for me to find that Zhan Cangtian. There is still hope in my heart.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Originally, I was someone who was soon to die. It is all thanks to you that I am able to continue to live. Thus, I am truly grateful.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you do not mind, I am willing to join the Cyanwood Mountain. I wish to join the Cyanwood Mountain, not as a nominal elder, but rather an actual elder,&#x201D; the Snow Blade Mad Demon said.</p><p>He had not joined the Cyanwood Mountain before because he had publicly killed an elder from the Heavenly Law Palace. Thus, he was afraid that he would implicate the Cyanwood Mountain should the Heavenly Law Palace seek vengeance against him.</p><p>And now, with how the relationship between the Cyanwood Mountain and the Heavenly Law Palace has changed, there was no need for him to worry about that anymore. Thus, he could join the Cyanwood Mountain without any apprehensions.</p><p>&#x201C;If senior Snow Blade is willing to join our Cyanwood Mountain, it would be our Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s blessing. How could I possibly mind?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng is thinking too highly of me. However, as I am now a part of the Cyanwood Mountain, I will definitely guard the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s dignity. I will not allow anyone to do anything to the Cyanwood Mountain.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely&#x2026; I still need to search for Zhan Cangtian. Thus, even though I&#x2019;ve joined the Cyanwood Mountain, I will likely not be able to remain in the Cyanwood Mountain forever. I hope little friend Chu Feng can excuse me on this,&#x201D; Snow Blade Mad Demon said.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhan Cangtian has done all sorts of evil. His continued existence is only a harm to everyone in the Holy Land of Martialism. If he is to be eliminated, it would be a blessing for the people of the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, senior Snow Blade, you do not have to stay in the Cyanwood Mountain. You can go ahead and continue with your search for Zhan Cangtian. That is your most important mission.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have two more Immortality Peaches here. Please consume them,&#x201D; Chu Feng took out two more Immortality Peaches and handed them to the Snow Blade Mad Demon.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
