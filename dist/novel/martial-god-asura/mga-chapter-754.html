<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 754 - Su Mei in Trouble</strong></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng arrived at Taikou&#x2019;s residence, but discovered he wasn&#x2019;t there.</span></p><p><span style="">However, a note was hung on his door. On it wrote: &#x201C;If Chu Feng comes to visit, please wait for a few hours.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Although Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t know where Taikou went, Taikou clearly knew Chu Feng would come and find him. Since Taikou had told him to wait, then naturally, he didn&#x2019;t have much of a choice on the matter since he had a request for Taikou. So, he sat down, cross-legged, and awaited Taikou outside his simple grass house.</span></p><p><span style="">However, such a wait was not as simple as several hours. Chu Feng had waited an entire night, straight until morning, then to noon, then to afternoon, but Taikou had yet to return.</span></p><p><span style="">Even so, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t move at all. He swore to wait for Taikou, so he would not leave.</span></p><p><span style="">It was because he prepared to leave the Four Seas Academy after asking Taikou a request.</span></p><p><span style="">Although there were still a few days until the arranged battle with the three disciples of the Four Protectors, he couldn&#x2019;t be certain whether the arranged battle was real or fake. So it would be better to head over early to familiarize himself with the general situation.</span></p><p><span style="">Due to that, he prepared to see Taikou, then meet up with Su Rou and the others, then leave the Four Seas Academy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, I&#x2019;m sorry Chu Feng! I had some things I needed to handle just now; I&#x2019;ve made you wait.&#x201D; Suddenly, a rather shameful voice rang out behind Chu Feng. Turning his head around, it was Taikou.</span></p><p><span style="">That made Chu Feng a bit surprised. Even with his current strength, Taikou was able to appear behind him without making a single sound, and without him knowing. It could be seen that the old man truly had quite a level of strength.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Taikou, you are truly too polite. I have actually not waited for long.&#x201D; Chu Feng hurriedly stood up and bowed to Taikou. Ever since Taikou helped him out with the trouble outside the Millennium Ancient City, Chu Feng had a much greater impression of Taikou.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm? Didn&#x2019;t you come to this place immediately after leaving the Millennium Ancient City?&#x201D; Taikou said with a smile, as if he had already seen through Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng was a bit speechless. He felt that Taikou knew some things.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, Chu Feng, you must have business with me, right?&#x201D; said Taikou straightforwardly. The difference between the attitude he treated Chu Feng and others was like the distance between heaven and earth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, we met merely by coincidence, but the assistance you&#x2019;ve given me is something I can never repay back. I&#x2019;ve come here today mainly to give you my thanks, senior. In the future, if there is anything you need my help with, I will definitely do my best to help you, in order to repay the favours you&#x2019;ve given me.&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he bowed once again to Taikou. It was gratitude he felt from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, it&#x2019;s quite easy if you want to repay me. Just become my disciple!&#x201D; Taikou said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; When he heard those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s face flushed because he truly didn&#x2019;t know how to reply.</span></p><p><span style="">Logically speaking, with his strength, Taikou was qualified to become Chu Feng&#x2019;s master. Also, Taikou has shown him favour, so it was not forbidden to have him as a master.</span></p><p><span style="">After all, a person having multiple masters wasn&#x2019;t some unvirtuous and immoral action. As long as the master was willing to, there was no problem.</span></p><p><span style="">But, that didn&#x2019;t matter since Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t like having new masters too casually. To him, the meaning of a master was something unordinary, it was something significant; one did not simply just decide to have a new master and did so thus.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, okay, I won&#x2019;t make things difficult for you.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Listen: I helped you because you&#x2019;ve left good impressions on me. I chose to do that myself; I did so completely willingly. So, you have no need to worry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Though, there was one thing I do want to ask you. I wonder if you can reply truthfully?&#x201D; said Taikou with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Taikou, please ask,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Can you tell me the truth on what occurred within the Millennium Ancient City?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, I will keep this a secret. It&#x2019;s just that I don&#x2019;t like being deceived, so I want to know the facts of what happened,&#x201D; said Taikou with a smile. However, his eyes, surrounded by wrinkles, emitted glints of intelligence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, if you were another person, I have indeed prepared to not speak the truth. But, to you, I have no need to hide it.&#x201D; Chu Feng had actually prepared already to speak the truth prior to coming here.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Chu Feng told everything that happened in the Millennium Ancient City to Taikou in detail, including that he was the one who killed Wang Long and the others, and that he was the one who solved the formations in the Millennium Ancient City. He pretty much left nothing hidden, other than the fact that he relied on the Divine Lightning in his body to force the Imperial Bloodline to yield.</span></p><p><span style="">He did so because to Chu Feng, the secret of the Divine Lightning was extremely important. Unless absolutely necessary, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t want outsiders to know.</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s narration, the expression on Taikou&#x2019;s face was a bit shocked. When he looked at Chu Feng, his gaze was more admirative. Only after quite a while did he say, &#x201C;Quite unexpectedly, your abilities are stronger than my expectations. You&#x2019;ve actually opened the formations of the Millennium Ancient City with your own strength, and even helped your friend obtain the Imperial Bloodline.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are truly a genius; I&#x2019;ve indeed not been mistaken. But sadly, you really aren&#x2019;t willing to take me as your master&#x2026; Whatever, what I hate the most is to force others into difficult situations.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Taikou, thank you for understanding.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just that&#x2026; My brother, Jiang Wushang, he possesses the Imperial Bloodline right now, and I&#x2019;m afraid others will harm him. So, Senior Taikou, I hope you can take care of him a bit,&#x201D; said Chu Feng, requesting. That was the thing he wanted to ask Taikou.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry, since they are your friends, even if you don&#x2019;t say anything I would have still taken care of them. No matter if it&#x2019;s those two boys, or those two girls, as long as I, Taikou, am here, no one will harm them in the Four Seas Academy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But, on that topic, there is truly a person at present who harbours malicious intents towards one of your friends. I wonder&#x2026; would you like me to take care of it for you, or will you do so personally?&#x201D; said Taikou while smiling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Taikou, who exactly is planning to harm my friend? Please tell me.&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart immediately tensed up when he heard those words as he quickly followed with a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a brat whose nerves could cover the sky. Not only does he not know repent, he clings onto hatred and is planning to make a move on that girl Su Mei. As for who it is, I&#x2019;m sure you already know. And, if I&#x2019;m not mistaken, he should have already arrived at that girl&#x2019;s residence,&#x201D; said Taikou.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, thank you for the warning.&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression, which was usually calm, involuntarily changed. The sweat on his forehead immediately seeped out, and without saying anything more, he turned around and prepared to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">From Taikou&#x2019;s words, he had already learnt of how serious that matter was. The person who was making a move on Su Mei was clearly Qin Yu. He recalled that Qin Yu was in the same league as Wang Long; they were people of the same mind.</span></p><p><span style="">And also recalling the lewd expression Qin Yu looked at Su Mei with, Chu Feng had a premonition on what despicable thing Qin Yu was about to do. He clearly failed with the &#x201C;soft&#x201D; method, and was currently using the &#x201C;hard&#x201D; method.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Chu Feng really did reach the extremities of fury. Su Mei was different from Lan Xi&#x2014;she was his fianc&#xE9;e. He hadn&#x2019;t even really touched her, yet Qin Yu already had thoughts? It was unacceptable, and his overwhelming bloodlust uncontrollably emanated outward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh, if you hurry like this you may not even reach in time. Let me help you out.&#x201D; Taikou though, he laughed when he looked at Chu Feng&#x2019;s nervous and angry expression, as if he had expected it.</span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, he flung his big sleeve, and in a mere instant, Chu Feng and he disappeared.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
