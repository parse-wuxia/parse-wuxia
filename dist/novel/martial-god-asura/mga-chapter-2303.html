<p><strong> Chapter 2303 - Rank Five Half Martial Ancestor</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Aiya, husband, you&#x2019;re awake?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How are you feeling? Do you feel any better?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Wang Qiang had awakened, the demonic woman became extremely excited. She nearly even tossed away the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower that she held in her hand.</p><p>Chu Feng, who knew that Wang Qiang had been pretending to be unconscious the entire time, turned to ask Wang Qiang, &#x201C;Wang Qiang, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;C-Chu Feng, t-that M-moon-moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower&#x2019;s roots are u-useless to me. H-however, they&#x2019;re useful for you. They m-might even be a-able to increase your cultivation. Y-you should refine them,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah? That won&#x2019;t do,&#x201D; Hearing those words, the demonic woman was immediately startled, and instantly refused.</p><p>&#x201C;W-w-why not? D-didn&#x2019;t you get that Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower for me? C-could it b-be that I d-do not even possess the a-authority to decide h-how to use it?&#x201D; Wang Qiang stood up in an annoyed manner. He had the attitude of a man of the house reprimanding his wife.</p><p>Strangely, this ferocious and savage demonic woman actually looked like an obedient little sheep before Wang Qiang.</p><p>This was especially true after she saw that Wang Qiang had gotten angry. The demonic woman&#x2019;s voice grew soft. She said, &#x201C;It is true that the root of this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower contains Natural Energy, but the Natural Energy that it contains is truly too berserk in nature. Even if Chu Feng is a possessor of Heavenly Bloodline, he will still not be able to withstand it. If he forcibly refines it, even if he doesn&#x2019;t get killed, his cultivation will end up being crippled.&#x201D;</p><p>It turned out that it was not that the demonic woman did not want to have Chu Feng refine the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower. Rather, it was because she was afraid that its roots would harm Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Y-you d-don&#x2019;t g-get to decide something like that, because y-you do not k-know how v-valiant my brother is,&#x201D; After Wang Qiang said those words, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Brother, just tell me s-straightforwardly. A-are you a-able to r-refine the root or not? R-remember, do not l-lie to me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, it is possible,&#x201D; Chu Feng was very moved. Wang Qiang was already seriously poisoned, and his life was in danger. Yet, he was still thinking for Chu Fengs Benefit right now. This camaraderie truly caused Chu Feng to feel warmth in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;T-there&#x2019;s still time f-for my poison. However, y-you should increase your c-cultivation first. If y-you a-are able to increase your cultivation, it w-would be helpful to y-you using your spirit power later. Thus, y-you should re-refine it first,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, is your cultivation actually that of a rank four Half Martial Ancestor, or a rank five Martial Ancestor?&#x201D; The demonic woman asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;My actual cultivation is that of a rank four Half Martial Ancestor. My rank five Martial Ancestor level cultivation was something temporary that I obtained through special means,&#x201D; Chu Feng spoke the truth.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case. In that case, go and refine the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower&#x2019;s roots first,&#x201D; After the demonic woman finished saying those words, she handed the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower to Chu Feng.</p><p>When Chu Feng received the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower, the demonic woman deliberately reminded him, &#x201C;Chu Feng, I am not deceiving you. Although this Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower&#x2019;s root contains dense amounts of Natural Energy, those Natural Energies are truly berserk in nature. Even for ordinary people with Heavenly Bloodlines, it will be impossible for them to refine it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although it is very possible that you are not an ordinary person with a Heavenly Bloodline, I must still urge you to be careful, and not force yourself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Got it,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled and nodded. He knew that the demonic woman was being considerate of him.</p><p>Furthermore, he also knew that the demonic woman was not trying to scare him. After all, no matter what sort of nature that demonic woman possessed, she was truly an experienced and knowledgeable individual. Moreover, it was true that the energy contained in the roots of the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower was extremely berserk.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not lie either. He was truly confident in being able to refine the Natural Energy contained in the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower&#x2019;s roots.</p><p>After receiving the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower, Chu Feng was not in a hurry to immediately refine it. Instead, he first set up a concealment formation.</p><p>This concealment formation was very special. Chu Feng had set it up for the sake of weakening the power of the Divine Tribulation.</p><p>Although Chu Feng was unable to ascertain whether or not he would break through to rank five Half Martial Ancestor after refining the root of the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower, it remained that it would be better that he prepare himself just in case.</p><p>&#x201C;Why did you set up a concealment formation?&#x201D; The demonic woman asked in a very puzzled manner.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll understand in the future,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Tsk~~&#x201D; That demonic woman curled her large mouth. She no longer continued to question Chu Feng. Instead, she turned around and ran over to Wang Qiang. With a very coy voice, she said, &#x201C;Hus~~~band!&#x201D;</p><p>Once that demonic woman&#x2019;s words were heard, Chu Feng noticed the clear change in Wang Qiang&#x2019;s expression. Fortunately, he had contained himself. Otherwise, Chu Feng would have burst into loud laugh.</p><p>Even though that demonic woman was very ugly, so ugly that even Wang Qiang could not accept her, it was the first time since Chu Feng knew Wang Qiang that a woman was fond of Wang Qiang.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng felt happy for Wang Qiang. Regardless of whether or not it was because of his potion&#x2019;s effect, it remained that the demonic woman was treating Wang Qiang very well right now.</p><p>After that, Chu Feng sat cross-legged in the concealment formation and began to refine the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower&#x2019;s roots.</p><p>Everything went on without a hitch. Even though the energy contained within the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower&#x2019;s roots was indeed extremely berserk, Chu Feng was still able to effortlessly refine all of the Natural Energy from the roots.</p><p>At the moment when Chu Feng completely refined everything, he actually brought forth the arrival of a Divine Tribulation.</p><p>Although the power of the Divine Tribulation was very strong, much stronger than the last time Chu Feng had reached a breakthrough, Chu Feng still managed to withstand it.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the fact that the power of the Divine Tribulation was affected by the concealment formation, neither Wang Qiang nor the demonic woman noticed the existence of the Divine Tribulation.</p><p>The two of them only noticed one thing. That is, Chu Feng had successfully reached a breakthrough from rank four Half Martial Ancestor to rank five Half Martial Ancestor.</p><p>&#x201C;You actually really managed to refine it?&#x201D; The demonic woman was astonished.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother, nice job,&#x201D; As for Wang Qiang, he was wild with joy.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother, thanks,&#x201D; Chu Feng stood up and said to Wang Qiang. Then, he looked to the demonic woman and said, &#x201C;Thanks.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to thank me. Even if I keep the roots, it will be useless. There is simply no one capable of refining the roots. However, you succeeded in refining it. It would appear that you are not an ordinary wielder of a Heavenly Bloodline,&#x201D; The demonic woman said. Her tone seemed to be praising Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng smiled. He did not wish to have an in-depth conversation regarding this topic. The reason for that was because he would not forget that he was deemed to be trash and banished from the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p><p>Genius? He no longer dared to consider himself a genius.</p><p>At the very least, he was very weak before that demonic woman.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s cure Wang Qiang&#x2019;s poison,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; The demonic woman nodded.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng started to work together with the demonic woman. They set up a spirit formation to draw support from the power of the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower to cure Wang Qiang&#x2019;s poison.</p><p>Merely, regardless of whether it was setting up the spirit formation or activating it, Chu Feng listened to the instructions provided by the demonic woman the entire time.</p><p>To put it simply, Chu Feng was only an assistant in curing Wang Qiang&#x2019;s poison.</p><p>The reason for that was because the spirit formation that the demonic woman was using actually surpassed the spirit formations that Chu Feng knew of.</p><p>This caused Chu Feng to have a whole new level of respect for that demonic woman again. Not only was she experienced and knowledgeable, her techniques were also very amazing.</p><p>Likely, to a greater or lesser degree, she carried memories of her previous life with her. After all, in her previous life, she was a super genius.</p><p>Everything went smoothly. The poison on Wang Qiang&#x2019;s body was successfully removed.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Merely, to everyone&#x2019;s surprise, at the moment when the poison was removed, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s body suddenly gave off a stage attractive force.</p><p>When that strange attractive force appeared, it once again condensed the poison that was just removed from Wang Qiang and absorbed it back into his dantian.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
