<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 789 - Exceeding?</strong></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Murong Xun held a silver spear in his hand. There were countless complex symbols engraved on it. Although the spear didn&#x2019;t emit any blinding light&#x2014;not even a single trace of light, as if it were an ordinary spear&#x2014;everyone could feel that the power that had just shook the sky and the earth originated from the silver spear in Murong Xun&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Holding it, the atmosphere surrounding him became completely different. At that moment, he no longer appeared to be a Martial Lord, but more akin to a Martial King. At least, at that very moment, he was infinitely close to becoming a Martial King.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is that silver-coloured spear? How did it cause Murong Xun&#x2019;s aura to become this powerful?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After feeling the change that occurred to Murong Xun, the expressions of Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming greatly changed. On their faces, fear appeared.</span></p><p><span style="">They subconsciously started to back away, because they knew what the current circumstances were. At that very instant, even though all three of them were working together, it was impossible for them to defeat Murong Xun.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Royal Armament? It&#x2019;s a Royal Armament?!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where did you obtain this Royal Armament? I&#x2019;ve never seen this before, unless&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know! It must be this. It must be that archaeological remains, you found a Royal Armament there!&#x201D; The Earth King also couldn&#x2019;t help crying out loud because he too recognized that the silver-coloured spear was a Royal Armament.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh, as expected of the Earth King. To have made so many deductions, I see that you&#x2019;re a bit knowledgeable. That&#x2019;s right. You&#x2019;re completely correct.&#x201D; The Eighth Immortal grinned smugly, then he loudly said, &#x201C;Back then, with our archipelago head leading the way, the reason why the Immortal Execution Archipelago went to investigate that presumed-to-be-garbage remains, despite the large number of losses, was because he calculated that there was definitely treasure inside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And in the end, as he expected, we found treasure inside the remains. Although we did suffer heavy losses, countless experts sacrificed&#x2014;even our vice-head and two Protectors passed away&#x2014;we obtained this Royal Armament from that place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Back then, there were even innumerable people who mocked the Immortal Execution Archipelago. They mocked our inexperience, our overestimation, that for a tiny bit of yield we ventured into the remains that had nothing but danger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But, they did not know that we found a Royal Armament inside, and relying on precisely this Royal Armament, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is able to reach its current height.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, your Crippling Night Demon Sect looked down on the achievements my Immortal Execution Archipelago has, but you have simply not seen how much we&#x2019;ve invested. Our head is a person with true intelligence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When he heard those words, the Earth King tightly furrowed his brows. His face was ashen, and very, very unsightly.</span></p><p><span style="">Back then, when the Immortal Execution Archipelago sent their full strength to investigate the remains, it was still when the Crippling Night Demon Sect ruled over the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, the reason why the Crippling Night Demon Sect did not go into that remains was because everyone in the Eastern Sea Region knew there was nothing inside. There were only endless dangers; it was a deadly trap.</span></p><p><span style="">So, when the Immortal Execution Archipelago decisively chose to enter, yet obtained absolutely nothing, and even lost so many experts, they naturally received mockery from everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, even the Crippling Night Demon Sect mocked the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s ignorance. Everyone felt that the Immortal Execution Archipelago let greed blind their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">But looking at it today, even the Earth King felt a bit of shame. At that moment, he had no choice but to admit that the Immortal Execution Archipelago did have some strength. At least, their head had devised a very deep plan. He was a true daring and ambitious person.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t this mean that the Immortal Execution Archipelago has six Royal Armaments now?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! A single Royal Armament is already so impressive, and the Immortal Execution Archipelago has </span><i><span style="">six</span></i><span style="">? Don&#x2019;t they have more than the Crippling Night Demon Sect when they were the most flourishing&#x2014;five?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone heard the conversation between the Earth King and the Eighth Immortal, and they also felt stunned.</span></p><p><span style="">Being able to possess what they currently did, the Immortal Execution Archipelago did fight for everything bit by bit. Back then, after the Crippling Night Demon Sect broke up, when the Burning Heaven Church was moving, the Eastern Sea Region was in an unprecedented chaotic era.</span></p><p><span style="">Forces arose everywhere, and for the position of overlord, a long battle was commenced.</span></p><p><span style="">At that time, there were many powerful forces. There were even some that had been around for several thousands of years, and even grasped a few techniques from the Ancient Era.</span></p><p><span style="">As for the Immortal Execution Archipelago, they were not too highly regarded. Although they had decent strength, in comparison to the forces that had existed for many years and even had Royal Armaments, they were still a bit weaker.</span></p><p><span style="">However, with the head of the Immortal Execution Archipelago leading them, they constantly defeated undefeatable opponents. Within three years, they made peace with the world, and became the overlord of the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, at that time, they obtained five Royal Armaments from their enemies. Five Royal Armament&#x2014;that number was the exact same as the number of Royal Armaments the Crippling Night Demon Sect owned during their prospering time.</span></p><p><span style="">Most importantly, not only did the Immortal Execution Archipelago solidify the position of overlord in the next few years, their overall strength rose in leaps and bounds.</span></p><p><span style="">One could even say that the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s overall strength was not the slightest bit inferior to the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s back then. Some even felt that the Immortal Execution Archipelago, at present, had already surpassed the Crippling Night Demon Sect in their most prosperous state.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, many did not believe that way of thinking. After all, the glory of the Crippling Night Demon Sect left undiminishable impressions on many people. However, today, after Murong Xun took out the sixth Royal Armament, their hearts were shaken.</span></p><p><span style="">Royal Armaments were really too precious, too powerful. They were often a standard that weighed the true strength of a force.</span></p><p><span style="">Now, the Immortal Execution Archipelago had actually taken out a sixth Royal Armament. That had surpassed the number that the Crippling Night Demon Sect had back then. As a result, some felt that, perhaps, the Immortal Execution Archipelago had surpassed the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, what happened? Are you three pieces of trash afraid?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You lackeys of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. You think that the sect is invincible, and you look down on my Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Now, you understand, right? No matter if you admit it or not, the Crippling Night Demon Sect is now a thing of the past. The glory of the Immortal Execution Archipelago was also obtained by every single punch and kick. Every single step that was taken added onto it, and we have already stomped your Crippling Night Demon Sect beneath our feet.&#x201D; Murong Xun smiled as he looked at Xuan Xiaochao and the others. He madly laughed&#x2014;it was full of pride.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rubbish!&#x201D; When he heard those words, You Tonghan was enraged. With an explosive shout, two dark rays of light shot out from his eyes. They were extremely terrifying; they even broke through the fabrics of space and with light-like speed, they shot straight towards Murong Xun. It was You Tonghan&#x2019;s trump card.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh, die!&#x201D; However, Murong Xun only smiled disdainfully at You Tonghan&#x2019;s attack. Shortly after that, the silver-coloured spear in his hand suddenly swayed.</span></p><p><span style="">A silver light flashed, and the body of the spear, like a silver dragon waving its tail, swept over with a beautiful arc. It not only instantly disintegrated You Tonghan&#x2019;s attack, it even brought over the might of a king towards him.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, You Tonghan, who was incomparably furious before, couldn&#x2019;t help changing his expression greatly, and yelled in his heart, &#x201C;Crap.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
