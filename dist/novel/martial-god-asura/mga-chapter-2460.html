<p><strong> Chapter 2460 - Unfavorable Battle Situation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What makes me think that I can contend against you? This is what!&#x201D;</p><p>However, faced with the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan Chief&#x2019;s attack, Zhan Yuanmo&#x2019;s expression remained unchanged.</p><p>He held his Ancestral Armament with his right hand and formed a palm with his left hand. Toward the incoming black slash, he shot forth his palm.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The next moment, the sound of metals colliding with one another was heard. The black ray of light was actually forcibly beaten back.</p><p>At the same time, golden light began to spring forth everywhere as a hundred-meter-long enormous golden axe appeared in the sky.</p><p>The moment the enormous golden axe appeared, an extremely frightening aura appeared with it.</p><p>At that moment, Zhan Yuanmo&#x2019;s aura was actually not at all inferior to that of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;The secret skill, Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the people of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan revealed stunned expressions. In fact, even their Clan Chief had an enormous change in expression.</p><p>Actually, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had broken through to rank five Martial Ancestor for more than two years now. The other reason why he had been afraid to attack the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s headquarters was because he was afraid of Zhan Yuanmo&#x2019;s secret skill, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe.</p><p>Today, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe was revealed before him. Sure enough, it was no small matter.</p><p>The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe was extraordinarily domineering. It had the aura of a ruler. Even without Zhan Yuanmo in the picture, merely that Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe&#x2019;s aura was already frightening enough.</p><p>At that moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clansmen all grew afraid. One by one, they began to retreat.</p><p>&#x201C;While you all might not have experienced the might of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe before, I&#x2019;m certain that your seniors must&#x2019;ve mentioned it to you all before, no?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you all are to retreat now, I am still able to consider letting you all go. Else&#x2026; do not blame this old man for unleashing a slaughter,&#x201D; With a malevolent expression, Zhan Yuanmo spoke coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, for the past two years, you&#x2019;ve been in closed-door training the entire time, afraid to fight me. This already revealed that you are not confident in being able to defeat me,&#x201D;The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;If I am to truly use the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, even if I must sacrifice my life, I will still be able to kill you,&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo said.</p><p>&#x201C;Is that so? Then allow me to experience whether or not your Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe really does possess such legendary power.&#x201D;</p><p>The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief sneered. Then, intense killing intent emerged in his eyes.</p><p>He pointed his weapon forward and shouted loudly, &#x201C;Soldiers of the Monstrous Clan, listen up! In today&#x2019;s battle, it is either the War Clan that will be extinguished, or our Monstrous Clan that will be extinguished! Kill them all!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kill!!!&#x201D;</p><p>The next moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s soldiers reacted as if they were given an order of death.</p><p>Not only did they stop becoming timid, but their morale also rose dramatically. As if they had gone berserk, they once again rushed forth to confront and kill the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s army.</p><p>They had an attitude that made it seem like they had to exterminate all of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen today.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill them!!!&#x201D;</p><p>As for the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan, they were not to be outdone. Their vast army was determined to battle to the death for the sake of their survival and honor.</p><p>Today, they were going to fight to the death against the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two armies collided with one another, killing one another.</p><p>&#x201C;This won&#x2019;t do. Big sister, this won&#x2019;t do. Over the past two years, our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan has grown much weaker. We are simply no match for the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, even if grandfather is truly able to kill the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief by relying on the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, he will definitely end up losing his life.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that moment, our War Clan will still not be a match for the Monstrous Clan, we will still be defeated,&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong said to Zhan Lingling in panic.</p><p>&#x201C;I can tell even without you mentioning it,&#x201D; Zhan Lingling also had a very ugly expression on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go and find big brother Chu Feng. He said that we can call for him if the Monstrous Clan is to come and attack us. He said that he would definitely help us.&#x201D;</p><p>As Zhan Lingtong spoke, he took out a circular title plate. It was the title plate Chu Feng had given him two years ago.</p><p>Upon seeing that title plate, Zhan Lingling also revealed a change in expression. She still remembered the scene of the youth ascending to the Martial Comprehension Ground&#x2019;s third level two years ago.</p><p>Her heart still shook upon recalling that scene now. After all, that youth did not only rely on his talent to ascend to the third level. In addition to his talent, there was also his unyielding willpower.</p><p>Chu Feng could be said to be the person that she felt the greatest admiration for so far. In fact, her admiration for Chu Feng might even surpass her admiration for Zhan Haichuan.</p><p>After all, no matter how powerful Zhan Haichuan might be, he was only a legend. He was someone whom she had never met before.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, she had clearly experienced his strength.</p><p>Chu Feng held an irreplaceable status in her heart.</p><p>However, even with that being the case, Zhan Lingling still shook her head. She said, &#x201C;If Chu Feng is to join the battle, he will indeed help our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan enormously. However, the ones that are difficult to deal with right now are all Martial Ancestor-level experts.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Facing those experts, even if Chu Feng is to join the battle, he will definitely not be a match for them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we are to call Chu Feng for assistance, we will end up harming him. Rather than calling him and causing him to throw his life away, it is better that we allow him to continue his closed-door training.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After all, even if the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan is capable of eliminating our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan, they are definitely not able to set foot onto the Martial Comprehension Ground&#x2019;s third level. With Chu Feng&#x2019;s talent, he will definitely be able to defeat the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan one day and help our War Clan get revenge,&#x201D; Zhan Lingling said.</p><p>Zhan Lingtong felt what Zhan Lingling said to be very sensible.</p><p>Indeed, no matter how strong Chu Feng might be, what sort of progress in cultivation could he possibly obtain in a short two years&#x2019; time?</p><p>If it was said that Chu Feng was a Martial Ancestor-level expert now, then Zhan Lingtong would definitely believe it. However, if it was said that Chu Feng could contend against the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, that rank five Martial Ancestor-level expert, Zhan Lingtong would not believe that to be possible.</p><p>Although it was now the moment of life and death for their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan, although Zhan Lingtong hoped that someone would be able to help their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan, what would Chu Feng possibly be able to do even if he were to come down from the Martial Comprehension Ground&#x2019;s third level? Wouldn&#x2019;t calling him only serve to have him throw his life away in vain?</p><p>When recalling how affectionate and true Chu Feng had been to them, Zhan Lingtong felt even more that he could not be selfish with no regard for others. Slowly, Zhan Lingtong pulled back the circular title plate in his hand. He planned to place it back into his bosom.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuahh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, a scream sounded from the sky. Following that, a spray of blood sprinkled down.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandfather!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling immediately revealed worried and pained expressions.</p><p>The blood was from their grandfather, Zhan Yuanmo. Zhan Yuanmo was actually already injured. His entire left arm had been sliced off.</p><p>Although Zhan Yuanmo immediately used a special method to reform his lost arm, he was unable to erase the bloodstains.</p><p>As for the thing that he was most unable to erase, it was the fact that he had his arm sliced off by the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief stared at Zhan Yuanmo, and then spoke in a very confident manner. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve lost.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Tis but a minor injury. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, this neither hurts nor tickles. The outcome of the battle has yet to be decided,&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo said in refusal to admit defeat.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief lightly raised his eyebrows. Then, he said, &#x201C;Are you certain?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo refused to accept his defeat. He moved his left hand, and then started to attack the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief again.</p><p>&#x201C;Puu!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Zhan Yuanmo sprayed out a mouthful of blood and revealed an incomparably painful expression. Then, he actually half-kneeled in midair.</p><p>At that moment, his expression turned very pale, and his aura became extremely weak. Shock filled his aged face.</p><p>The reason for that was because he was shocked to discover that his secret skill, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, was actually also growing weaker.</p><p>&#x201C;How can this be?&#x201D;</p><p>It was not only Zhan Yuanmo that was puzzled. The others of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan were also puzzled by what was happening.</p><p>That attack had clearly left only a superficial wound. For an expert like Zhan Yuanmo, it should not have been able to affect him at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you think that my previous attack was only an ordinary attack?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I might as well tell you the truth. What I used earlier was a secret skill especially meant to restrain your Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe,&#x201D; The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief spoke complacently.</p><p>&#x201C;Who are you trying to scare here? There is no such thing as a secret skill that can restrain the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe. Furthermore, I&#x2019;ve never heard of your Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan having some sort of secret skill.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly what sort of despicable means did you use to injure my father?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief pointed at the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief angrily. He did not believe what the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had just said.</p><p>&#x201C;Just because there wasn&#x2019;t such a secret skill before doesn&#x2019;t mean that there isn&#x2019;t one now. While you can refuse to believe what I said now, you will definitely believe me once I tell you its creator.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This secret skill of mine is called Enemy Restraining Slash.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is something that our clan&#x2019;s senior, Lord Yao Xing, created with all of his energy,&#x201D; The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said proudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Yao Xing? It&#x2019;s actually Yao Xing?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing that name, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen all revealed unease and terror.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
