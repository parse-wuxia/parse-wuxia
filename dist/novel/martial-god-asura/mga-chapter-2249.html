<p><strong> Chapter 2249 - Hair Stand Up In Anger</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The punch knocked Ying Liangchen several tens of thousands of meters away, knocking him out of the entire mountain range.</p><p>However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still chased after him, unwilling to let him get away. Soon, he arrived before Ying Liangchen once again.</p><p>Merely, when Chu Feng saw the currently Ying Liangchen, his gaze changed to reveal an expression of surprise.</p><p>Even if Chu Feng&#x2019;s earlier punch had not been powerful enough to kill Ying Liangchen, it should have been enough to seriously injure him.</p><p>However, other than a few bloodstains, Ying Liangchen was practically uninjured.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard, seems like you have some abilities. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that I had this, I might have actually been beaten to death by you.&#x201D;</p><p>Ying Liangchen took out an item from under his clothes. It was a pearl. Merely, that pearl had already been shattered.</p><p>Needless to say, the power behind Chu Feng&#x2019;s punch had been absorbed by that pearl. It was because of that pearl that Ying Liangchen was able to stand before Chu Feng practically uninjured.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you shouldn&#x2019;t be a relative of that Liu Chengkun, no? So, why are you fighting for him?&#x201D; Ying Liangchen asked. From his appearance, it seemed that he did not wish to continue to be tangled with Chu Feng, and was trying to make peace.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your rubbish!&#x201D; However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s killing intent had already been unleashed. As such, he would not make peace. With a loud shout, Chu Feng began to rush toward Ying Liangchen to attack him again.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard, do you know who I am? I am the son of the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief! If you dare to kill me, my father will not spare you!&#x201D; While fighting against Chu Feng, Ying Liangchen started to shout threats at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;I, Chu Feng, have come here today precisely so that I can take your dog life,&#x201D; Chu Feng spoke coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;It seemed that you are insistent on killing me today. Since that is the case, I will also not act leniently toward you anymore!&#x201D;</p><p>Ying Liangchen snorted coldly. Then, boundless power surged forth from his body. His power swept forth in all directions. Following that, boundless power surged into the sky.</p><p>Soon, the void started to twist as an enormous monster appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was a giant creature, so enormous that it hid the sky and covered the earth. Its power was incomparably frightening. As wave upon wave of its frightening oppressive might swept forth, Chu Feng felt that his bones were being jolted to a crackle.</p><p>It was an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill. This Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was something that Chu Feng had seen the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master use before. Merely, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had not fully mastered it. Furthermore, as his cultivation had been too weak, this had made it so that only an enormous mouth had appeared.</p><p>However, that Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was now being fully unleashed by Ying Liangchen. It took the form of a giant creature.</p><p>That beast was so enormous that it covered the entire sky. It was both oppressive and powerful. It was simply incomparable to the time when the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had unleashed that Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.</p><p>&#x201C;Originally, I had thought about giving you a chance and sparing your life. However, never would I have expected that you would refuse a toast, only to be forced to drink a forfeit. You have forced this Young Master to unleash my strongest skill.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard who has overestimated his ability, drop dead! This is the disparity between you and this Young Master!&#x201D; Ying Liangchen shouted. Then, that enormous beast started to descend from the sky.</p><p>As it descended, its frightening might also descended from the sky. That oppressive might was going to crush Chu Feng to death.</p><p>However, right at this moment, Chu Feng raised his hand and shot forth a punch. Immediately, boundless power soared into the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Following a loud clamor, that descending giant creature actually let out a miserable howl of grief.</p><p>Then, with a loud &#x2018;boom,&#x2019; that enormous beast shattered into pieces.</p><p>At the same time, the surrounding space and the ground started to shatter nonstop as a boundless power started to engulf the surroundings, devouring everything in its path.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s fist strike was no ordinary fist strike. Instead, it was an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, the Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation.</p><p>Even though the Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation appeared to be a very simple technique, it was extremely domineering and incomparably fierce.</p><p>Ying Liangchen&#x2019;s martial skill was actually very powerful too. In terms of martial skills, the two martial skills were actually equally matched.</p><p>In terms of battle power, as Ying Liangchen was an extraordinary genius, his battle power could also be said to be on par with Chu Feng&#x2019;s.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng was able to defeat Ying Liangchen&#x2019;s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill when he possessed the same battle power and martial skills was actually all because of the bamboo slip in his dantian.</p><p>Back then, Chu Feng had managed to obtain comprehension from the bamboo slip, and achieve a whole new understanding of martial skills.</p><p>That had led to the power of Chu Feng&#x2019;s martial skills increasing enormously. That was also the reason why Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength greatly surpassed those with the same battle power as him.</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible! This is impossible! I spent a total of three hundred years to master that Emperor Taboo Martial Skill!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even when faced with Emperor Taboo Martial Skills that have also been mastered, I should still be able to fight against them!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How could you break through my Emperor Taboo Martial Skill?! Furthermore, you managed to destroy it that easily! How could that be possible?!&#x201D;</p><p>Astonishment filled Ying Liangchen&#x2019;s face. As he spoke those words, mouthfuls of blood were spraying from his mouth nonstop.</p><p>Although Chu Feng&#x2019;s fist had not struck him, and had instead destroyed his Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, the power of Chu Feng&#x2019;s fist was simply too strong.</p><p>Merely the aftermath of Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack was sufficient to jolt Ying Liangchen to a seriously injured state.</p><p>At this moment, Ying Liangchen&#x2019;s entire body was covered with blood. He had changed beyond recognition and fallen to the ground. He was powerless to even move. He had completely lost his ability to continue fighting.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t kill me. Don&#x2019;t kill me. Chu Feng, speak your condition. Whatever it might be, I will definitely satisfy you,&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng was walking toward him with overwhelming killing intent, Ying Liangchen was completely terrified.</p><p>&#x201C;I have one thing I need to ask you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it? Go ahead and ask. As long as you don&#x2019;t kill me, I will answer all your questions,&#x201D; Ying Liangchen said.</p><p>&#x201C;There were neither grievances or grudges between you and the Red Butterfly Society; why did you kill them? Did someone prompt you to kill them?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I was incited to kill them by someone. It was Chu Luyang. It was Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion&#x2019;s Chu Luyang. He had sent me a letter telling me the location of the Red Butterfly Society&#x2019;s headquarters, and asked me to help him eliminate the Red Butterfly Society.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will not deceive you. I have his personally written letter. There is also his origin life seal imprinted onto it. If you don&#x2019;t trust me, you can look at it yourself,&#x201D; Ying Liangchen was truly scared. He took out the letter and handed it to Chu Feng even without Chu Feng interrogating him.</p><p>Chu Feng extended his hand, and the letter flew into his hand.</p><p>Upon opening the letter, he discovered that the letter really did contain Chu Luyang&#x2019;s aura, as well as his origin life seal.</p><p>Even if one&#x2019;s aura could be forged, one&#x2019;s origin life seal could not be forged. Thus&#x2026; that letter was most definitely written by Chu Luyang.</p><p>The contents of the letter were pretty much what Chu Feng had thought they would be. Chu Luyang had requested Ying Liangchen&#x2019;s assistance in eliminating the Red Butterfly Society&#x2019;s management elders.</p><p>Of course, he had also mentioned in the letter to eliminate Chu Feng and the Red Butterfly Society&#x2019;s President should Ying Liangchen encounter them.</p><p>&#x201C;You damned bastard!&#x201D; After Chu Feng finished reading the contents of the letter, his rage burst forth once again.</p><p>The reason for that was because the benefits for Ying Liangchen that Chu Luyang mentioned in his letter was that he would allow Ying Liangchen to choose beauties from his Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion.</p><p>For the sake of those beauties, Ying Liangchen had decided to go to the Red Butterfly Society&#x2019;s headquarters to massacre them. His action truly caused one&#x2019;s hair to stand up in anger.</p><p>&#x201C;You actually decided to massacre so many innocent people for the sake of satisfying your own lust?! You are truly devoid of conscience! Even if I were to kill you ten thousand times, it would not be enough to alleviate the hatred in my heart!!!&#x201D; Chu Feng pointed at Ying Liangchen and shouted furiously.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
