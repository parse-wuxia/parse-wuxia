<p><strong> Chapter 1897 - Capture All</strong></p><p>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng and the others finally arrived at the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>Atop the multi-colored water&#x2019;s surface were nine golden pillars that soared straight into the sky. The nine golden pillars appeared to be extremely magnificent.</p><p>The nine pillars stood in an orderly manner like nine guards protecting the area. They were the Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, watch carefully,&#x201D; After Xian Yuyin finished saying those words to Chu Feng, he leapt directly into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>He felt that he had to be the first one to enter the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. The reason for that was because he would be able to bring an enormous pressure to Chu Feng after triggering six Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.</p><p>Furthermore, he felt that Chu Feng was simply incapable of triggering the Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. Even if he were able to, he would, at the very most, be able to trigger a single Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. At that time, he would be able to form a clear contrast to show how incompetent Chu Feng was.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, the nine Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles here are indeed different from the ones in the Cyanwood Domain. What percentage of certainty do you have in successfully triggering them?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;If I said I could trigger all nine, would you trust me?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, it&#x2019;s precisely your confidence that I like,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just joking. The Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles here are extremely extraordinary. They have caused the pressure in the depths of the pond to be extremely powerful. Even the current me, although my strength greatly surpasses my strength before, does not possess much certainty in being able to trigger all nine Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. However, since I&#x2019;ve come here, I must do everything I can. If I am really able to trigger all nine of them&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng did not finish his words. The reason for that was because it was only a guess. Back when he triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle in the Cyanwood Domain, he had obtained quite a harvest from it. It allowed him to break through to the Martial King realm on the spot.</p><p>If the Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles in this place were also able to bring benefits to Chu Feng, then the harvest which he would obtain should be much better than that what he had been able to obtain from the Silver Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.</p><p>Chu Feng did not have any extravagant hope like being able to reach a breakthrough to Martial Emperor. However, he hoped that he would be able to make progress with his cultivation. At the very least, he hoped that the harvest here would serve as the foundation for his future breakthrough to Martial Emperor. As long As Chu Feng became an actual Martial Emperor, he would be able to save Yao&#x2019;er in the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>At the moment when Chu Feng was pondering, the majority of the crowd had their eyes cast on the nine Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.</p><p>The reason for that was because they knew that Xian Yuyin would definitely be able to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. The only question was the time it would take and how many he could trigger.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Sure enough, not long afterward, a Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle started to blossom with dazzling radiance. Merely, this was no silver light. Instead, it was a golden light. At the same time, countless runes and symbols began to scatter all over the place as if they were alive.</p><p>&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This fast?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes started to shine. He did not expect for Xian Yuyin to be able to trigger the first Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle this quickly.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately afterward, an ear-piercing thunder exploded from the top of that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. The enormous rumble caused space itself to tremble. That sound was truly too ear-piercing. Not only that, it brought great intimidation to one&#x2019;s heart. Practically everyone present was intimidated by that thunder.</p><p>&#x201C;Zzzzz&#x201D;</p><p>Right after the extremely imposing thunder sounded, a dazzling green bolt of lightning shot out from that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle&#x2019;s peak.</p><p>That green lightning was incomparably thick, and looked extremely magnificent, like an enormous dragon made of countless lightning bolts. With a impressive display of unparalleled power, it conquered everything before its path and covered the sky.</p><p>The densely packed lightning bolts formed an enormous net of lightning. Furthermore, that net was still increasing in size nonstop. It was as if it was planning to seal off the entire sky.</p><p>Wild and overbearing. At that moment, everyone was able to feel an incomparable might from that green lightning.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble&#x201D;</p><p>Soon, another loud explosion was heard from another Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle, and another lightning bolt soared into the sky. When that second bolt of green lightning soared into the sky, the net of lighting in the sky became even more dazzling and imposing.</p><p>If ordinary people were to see this scene, they would definitely be filled with endless amazement and awe. However, the crowd present seemed to have all grown used to this sort of spectacle. Even though they possessed joyous smiles on their faces, they were not very shocked by it.</p><p>After the first two Golden Needles were triggered in succession, the third, fourth and fifth Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles were also triggered in succession. The speed at which they were being triggered could be said to be extremely fast.</p><p>At that moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves that knew Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s talent well all nodded in a satisfied manner, for Xian Yuyin had not disappointed them. Of course, they all knew that being able to trigger five Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles was Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s limit.</p><p>Suddenly, the Avaricious Immortal pointed to another Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle and shouted in shock, &#x201C;Quickly, look, another Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle is lighting up,&#x201D;</p><p>In response, the crowd all turned their gazes over to that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. At that moment, the eyes of practically all of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves present started to shine with amazement.</p><p>The sixth Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle had been triggered. Xian Yuyin had broken his previous best record. As for this new record, it was also the best record that the current Elf Kingdom&#x2019;s Elf King had managed to obtain.</p><p>At that moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; Elders and Protectors all involuntarily took a glance at the Elf King. It was as if they were indicating that Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s cultivation would be able to reach the same height as the current Elf King.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, that guy, how did he&#x2026;&#x201D; At the moment when the majority of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves were feeling joy over the matter, Xian Miaomiao and her sister Xiang Lingyue were frowning with expressions of unease.</p><p>Actually, the two sisters would not care about how many Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles Xian Yuyin would be able to trigger in ordinary times. However, today was different, as Xian Yuyin was competing with Chu Feng to see who would be able to trigger more of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.</p><p>For Xian Yuyin to actually make progress at such a time and trigger six Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles was extremely bad for Chu Feng. As such, how could the two sisters possibly feel at ease?</p><p>However, the result had already been determined. Xian Yuyin had managed to trigger six Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. This was an unchangeable fact.</p><p>&#x201C;Splash~~~&#x201D;</p><p>While the green lightning that filled the sky was still present in the sky, Xian Yuyin flew back out from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. He had a complacent smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Yuyin, you have truly given us a pleasant surprise,&#x201D; At that moment, not to mention the Protectors, even the Four Great Elders had personally stepped forward to receive Xian Yuyin. To trigger six Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles indirectly meant that Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s talent was even stronger than they had anticipated. As such, how could they not be in joy?</p><p>Showered with praise, the smile on Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s face grew even wider. He took a glance at Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, it&#x2019;s your turn. However, I&#x2019;d advise you to not try to show off and end up dying in there. While your death would not matter, I fear that your corpse will dirty the water of our Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ll have to disappoint you.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng smiled lightly. He did not become angry because of Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s provocation.</p><p>However, seeing how calm and collected Chu Feng was, Xian Yuyin revealed an angry expression in his eyes.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression made him feel as if Chu Feng had never placed him in his eyes the entire time. This sort of feeling was extremely unpleasant for him.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng was not in a rush to enter the water. Instead, he waited until the lightning in the sky dissipated, and the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles that were emitting the lightning returned to normal before leaping into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng had entered the water, Xian Miaomiao and her sister Xian Lingyue both revealed worried expressions.</p><p>After Chu Feng entered the water, he moved extremely quickly. Like a water dragon, he rapidly dived into the depths of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>As Chu Feng dived deeper and deeper, the powerful pressure grew stronger and stronger. Fortunately, Chu Feng was yet to be affected by that pressure.</p><p>&#x201C;That is?&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng stopped diving and turned his gaze to the nearby area.</p><p>At that place&#x2026; was a special sort of organism.</p><p>That organism was only as large as a firefly. However, it was completely transparent, colorless and odorless. In fact, it did not even emit any aura. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that he was using his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, Chu Feng might not necessarily be able to catch sight of that organism either.</p><p>Chu Feng had met that organism before in the Cyanwood Domain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. They were a sort of cultivation resource.</p><p>&#x201C;Pop~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Out of curiosity, Chu Feng grabbed the organism and snapped it apart. Then, it turned into Natural Energy, entered through Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm and traveled into his dantian.</p><p>Right after that, Chu Feng revealed a joyous expression. &#x201C;This energy, it&#x2019;s actually this dense?&#x201D; Although this organism possessed the exact same appearance as the one in the Cyanwood Domain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond, the Natural Energies which it contained were a world apart.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Chu Feng discovered three more of the strange organisms nearby. After he captured them with his hand, they actually gave off the same sort of extremely dense Natural Energy.</p><p>&#x201C;It would appear that my trip has truly not been made in vain,&#x201D; At that moment, Chu Feng was overjoyed. Although a single one of such organisms might only possess a negligible amount of Natural Energy for Chu Feng, it appeared that this Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond possessed countless such organisms.</p><p>If he was able to capture all of them and refine them, he would definitely obtain quite a large harvest. It might even be possible for him to reach a breakthrough to Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Thinking about it, Chu Feng stopped diving deeper, and instead began to swim all around. He swam around the nine Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles as he gradually dove deeper, whilst searching for those astonishing organisms.</p><p>Chu Feng was planning to capture all of the strange organisms in this Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond and refine them.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
