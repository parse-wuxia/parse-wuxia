<p><strong> Chapter 2186 - Immortal-cloak World Spiritist</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s body shifted as he rapidly rushed toward that place. After he descended to the ground, he discovered that there didn&#x2019;t seem to be anything abnormal on the surface.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes were not deceiving him. Thus, Chu Feng used special methods to enter deep underground.</p><p>After passing through layers of soil, it was as Chu Feng had anticipated, he discovered an entrance to a tunnel with his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes deep underground.</p><p>Chu Feng passed through the entrance, and discovered that even though the tunnel was very well-hidden, it was also very crudely made. It was as if it was a hole dug by an enormous mole, without any sign of being polished.</p><p>Although it was not polished, this place was sealed off by a layer of powerful and invisible spirit power. The only way to enter would be through the entrance that Chu Feng had discovered; it was impossible to enter this place by digging directly underground.</p><p>In short, this place was most definitely not formed by nature. Else, this place would not have been sealed off by such a powerful spirit formation. Furthermore, even though the spirit power in this place was invisible, Chu Feng was able to sense that it was very strong and ancient.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng was unable to see the spirit power, Chu Feng knew that the spirit formation here was most definitely not created by a Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Instead, this should be the work of an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>&#x201C;This is strange.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed.</p><p>As that place was created by someone, there should naturally be a lot of hurdles. However, Chu Feng had been completely unhindered in his journey so far.</p><p>The reason for that was not because there were no hurdles set up in this place. Instead, Chu Feng could tell that there used to be a lot of hurdles here. Merely, they were all broken through by someone.</p><p>Furthermore, the hurdles were only just recently broken through.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone has come here before me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who could it be?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng revealed a doubting gaze. Even though the hurdles were broken through, he became increasingly cautious.</p><p>He felt that it was very possible that someone had been to this place before. It might even be possible for that person to still be in here.</p><p>However, faced with the enticement of treasures, Chu Feng was unwilling to let such an opportunity slip by him so easily. Thus, he decided to gamble, and chose to continue onward.</p><p>Finally, Chu Feng reached the end of the tunnel. His surroundings were no longer the narrow tunnel. Instead, it was a vast space.</p><p>There was a coffin in the center of that place. Surrounding the coffin were all sorts of treasures. Not only were there a lot of cultivation resources, there were also a lot of treasures useful for world spiritists. All of those things were useful for Chu Feng.</p><p>Merely, surrounding the coffin and the treasures was an ancient grand formation.</p><p>That spirit formation was extremely dangerous. The way Chu Feng saw it, it was simply an impregnable fort. Not to mention undoing that formation, Chu Feng believed that he would be instantly killed by that spirit formation should he approach it.</p><p>However&#x2026; to Chu Feng&#x2019;s greatest surprise there was a person before that grand formation. That person was the old monk Chu Feng had met before.</p><p>At that moment, that old monk had also set up a spirit formation. He was using his spirit formation to undo the ancient spirit formation surrounding the coffin and treasures.</p><p>&#x201C;Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng looked at the spirit power composed of gold and red colors, that spirit power that seemed like the multi-colored twilight of a sunrise or sunset, he was able to determine that the old monk was definitely an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>The reason for that was because the spirit power that he was emitting was something that Chu Feng had never seen before. Furthermore, merely by sensing it, Chu Feng was able to tell that that spirit power was many times more powerful than his own Dragon Mark Royal-cloak world spirit power. In fact, the two spirit powers were simply incomparable to one another.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that it was most definitely Immortal-cloak world spirit power.</p><p>&#x201C;That veined pattern, it&#x2019;s Dragon Mark. He&#x2019;s&#x2026; actually a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Chu Feng was even more shocked. Dragon Marks filled that sunset-colored world spirit power.</p><p>This meant that the old monk was not only an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he was also a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng felt something that he rarely felt - lingering fear. After all, when he had first encountered the old monk, Chu Feng had attacked him. However, looking at it now, he was merely trying to strike a stone with an egg.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng finally understood the words spoken by the old monk that day. That day, he truly had been foolish.</p><p>&#x201C;Scram!&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a boundless killing intent appeared. Following that, a hundred enormous figures appeared before Chu Feng.</p><p>Those&#x2026; were actually a hundred world spirits from the Demon Spirit World. Merely, these hundred world spirits from the Demon Spirit World were much more powerful than all the world spirits Chu Feng had seen before.</p><p>They were all wearing armor, and appeared very ferocious. Any one of them would possess sufficient power to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng was unable to sense the cultivations of those world spirits. However, he was able to guess that those hundred world spirits were all Martial Ancestor-level experts at the very minimum. In fact, he felt that they might even be existences that surpassed Martial Ancestors.</p><p>The reason for that was because the oppressive might and killing intent they emitted made Chu Feng feel as if he had stepped into the gates of hell.</p><p>With a single thought, Chu Feng would be killed instantly.</p><p>Standing before Chu Feng, they simply did not appear like ordinary world spirits. Instead, they appeared more like a hundred Grim Reapers.</p><p>&#x201C;Do not be rude.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, that old monk&#x2019;s voice sounded. He did not look in Chu Feng&#x2019;s direction, and instead continued to wholeheartedly set up his spirit formation. However&#x2026; it was evident that he had noticed Chu Feng&#x2019;s arrival.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After the old monk said those words, the hundred Demon Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits all disappeared.</p><p>Chu Feng was able to tell that the hundred Demon Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits had not actually disappeared. Instead, they had just concealed themselves, and were still in the surroundings.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, this is&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng wanted to ask.</p><p>&#x201C;Hush, speak later. I&#x2019;m about to succeed,&#x201D; As the old monk said those words, he still did not look at Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng understood the old monk&#x2019;s intentions. Thus, he moved to the side and spoke no further. Instead, he began to carefully observe the old monk&#x2019;s spirit formation.</p><p>The more Chu Feng observed, the more afraid he became. The spirit formation this old man was setting up was simply too exceptional. It was a spirit formation that had surpassed Chu Feng&#x2019;s understanding of spirit formations.</p><p>That was a grand spirit formation that Chu Feng had never seen before. As he observed the spirit formation, Chu Feng grew obsessed with it.</p><p>To world spiritists, a powerful spirit formation was akin to a work of art.</p><p>Not only was it capable of fascinating others, one would also be able to obtain many benefits should one possess a good sense of comprehension.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng felt an unprecedented sensation from the spirit formation. Chu Feng faintly felt that a new gate was appearing in his world spirit space.</p><p>That was a gate that could connect to Immortal level world spirit power. Merely, even though the gate had appeared, it had yet to open.</p><p>This was the same as how Chu Feng had gathered sufficient Natural Energy to break through to rank three Half Martial Ancestor, but was unable to do so due to the bottleneck blocking his path.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was still overjoyed. Even though he was unable to open the gate leading to Immortal level spirit power, he was, at the very least, able to sense that gate. Before&#x2026; he was unable to even sense it.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. Surging spirit power began to engulf the surroundings like a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses.</p><p>Suddenly the impregnable tunnel started to shake nonstop. Even Chu Feng was forced back repeatedly by that violently surging spirit power.</p><p>&#x201C;Success? That ancient spirit formation was actually broken through?&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Chu Feng was blown away by the surging spirit power, he still revealed a joyous expression. The reason for that was because he was able to sense that the ancient grand spirit formation that sealed the mysterious coffin and treasures had been broken.</p><p>The mysterious old monk had broken through the ancient spirit formation.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
