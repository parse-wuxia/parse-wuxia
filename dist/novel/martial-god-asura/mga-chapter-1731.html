<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1731 - Public Humiliation</strong></p><p>Chu Feng had fully revealed his strength. Many people felt that this young man by the name of Feng Xing was simply a heavenly genius, someone capable of becoming an era&#x2019;s overlord.</p><p>In this sort of situation, the number of people who began to secretly try to befriend Chu Feng became more and more numerous.</p><p>Those who were capable of representing their respective powers, for example, the headmasters and assembly masters from the Nine Powers, all began to try to befriend Chu Feng. Other than the Cyanwood Mountain, all eight of the other Nine Powers were trying to get into a good relationship with Chu Feng.</p><p>Even the World Spiritist Alliance that had already accepted Chu Feng as their nominal disciple was acting this way.</p><p>Especially the World Spiritist Immortal. This grand Assembly Master of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly had personally spoken to openly express his fondness for Chu Feng.</p><p>In fact, he was indeed very fond of Chu Feng. After all, when Chu Feng received the backlash from the Evil God Sword, he was the only person who acted to try to rescue him.</p><p>As for those people who were unable to represent their respective powers, they were also trying to personally become Chu Feng&#x2019;s friends.</p><p>Not mentioning those small sects, small schools or hidden experts, even the people from the Three Palaces started to secretly communicate with Chu Feng.</p><p>In fact, they were filled with regret. They regretted the fact that there weren&#x2019;t any grand characters from their Three Palaces present at this moment. Otherwise, if they were to be able to rope this young man called Feng Xing into associating with their power, it would be a great harvest.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Feng Xing, as the saying goes, an exchange of blows may lead to friendship. If possible, our Beitang Imperial Clan wishes to invite little friend Feng Xing as well as that brother with the conical bamboo hat to our Beitang Imperial Clan as guests.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If the two of you are occupied with matters at hand, that would be fine too. I am able to present you two with our Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Title Plate. You may come and visit our Beitang Imperial Clan at any time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As long as you are to come, our Beitang Imperial Clan will definitely treat you as highly honored guests,&#x201D; Right at this moment, the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief suddenly stood up and openly tried to rope in Chu Feng and Baili Xuankong.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Feng Xing, our Dongfang Imperial Clan also wishes to invite you to be our guest,&#x201D; Even more shockingly, the Dongfang Imperial Clan tried to invite Chu Feng.</p><p>The Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s invitation caused the crowd to open their mouths wide in shock. It was one thing for the Beitang Imperial Clan to invite Feng Xing. After all, their younger generation had not fought against him.</p><p>However, the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Third Prince, Dongfang Zexuan, had suffered a crushing defeat at Feng Xing&#x2019;s hand. Yet, they were actually still going to invite Feng Xing?</p><p>This truly felt unimaginable to the crowd. They were unable to comprehend the actions of the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Beidou stood up. &#x201C;Two Clan Chiefs, you shouldn&#x2019;t fight over this. Even if he must be a guest, I feel that little friend Feng Xing should consider our Nangong Imperial Clan the most.&#x201D;</p><p>The crowd was even more shocked. However, upon seeing the passionate expressions filled with admiration on the faces of the three Lord Clan Chiefs, they were soon relieved.</p><p>Even the Nangong Imperial Clan was inviting Feng Xing. What did this mean? It meant that this young man by the name of Feng Xing was a truly outstanding talent. The Three Great Imperial Clans were all voluntarily planning to forget previous differences in order to turn Feng Xing from an enemy into a friend.</p><p>&#x201C;Nangong Beidou, what do you mean by that?&#x201D; The Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked in a displeased manner.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. First come, first serve. Even if little friend Feng Xing is to plan to become a guest to any of us, little friend Feng Xing should be considering our Beitang Imperial Clan first. Why would he be considering your Nangong Imperial Clan first?&#x201D; The Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was also displaying a displeased expression. After all, he had been the first one to invite Feng Xing.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Feng Xing injured my daughter and two sons in succession. However, I am filled with admiration for little friend Feng Xing, and I possess not the slightest bit of hatred for him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I feel that, merely by my admiration for him, if little friend Feng Xing were to choose which among us he should be a guest to first, it would naturally be our Nangong Imperial Clan,&#x201D; Nangong Beidou said with a beaming smile.</p><p>When he said those words, he deliberately took a glance at Chu Feng. Chu Feng discovered that even though there was a smile on his face, there was no genuine admiration in his eyes.</p><p>Likely, he was planning to rope in Chu Feng because of the talent Chu Feng had displayed. He had invited Chu Feng only so that he could pave the road for the Nangong Imperial Clan in the future, and not because he truly admired Chu Feng&#x2019;s talent.</p><p>Upon recalling all the things Nangong Beidou had done to him, Chu Feng started to smirk in his heart. Thus, he said to the crowd, &#x201C;I am able to consider the invitations from the Beitang Imperial Clan and Dongfang Imperial Clan. After all, it is difficult to reject such magnificent hospitality. However, as for the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s invitation, it&#x2019;s best to forget about it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even though I, Feng Xing, am a very daring person, I would still not dare to set foot into the Nangong Imperial Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Feng Xing, what is the meaning of those words?&#x201D; Hearing those words, even though Nangong Beidou was generally a very calm person and one who rarely revealed anger on his face, his expression still changed.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Feng Xing, could it be that you possess some sort of misunderstanding with the Nangong Imperial Clan?&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal asked. He was different from Nangong Beidou. After this competition, he was feeling admiration for Chu Feng from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>Furthermore, as he was part of the Nangong Imperial Clan, White-browed Immortal would naturally wish for this young man called Feng Xing to have a friendly relationship with the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Misunderstanding? I don&#x2019;t think this is a misunderstanding,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile and an extremely determined expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Feng Xing, if you do not wish to stay as a guest in our Nangong Imperial Clan, I will not demand insistently. However, why must you insult our Nangong Imperial Clan?&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Beidou was somewhat angered. He had been willing to forget previous differences, and how Feng Xing had seriously injured his sons, to instead invite him to be a guest at their Nangong Imperial Clan. Yet, this Feng Xing actually spoke these sorts of words to him. His behavior was truly impudent.</p><p>The way he saw it, what Feng Xing had said was simply declaring that their Nangong Imperial Clan was inferior to the Beitang Imperial Clan and Dongfang Imperial Clan. As such, how could he not be angered?</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Chief Nangong, I&#x2019;ll ask you about one thing. Not long ago, you all listed a person by the name of Chu Feng as wanted. As far as I know, that Chu Feng could be considered to be a person who showed grace and kindness to your Nangong Imperial Clan, and he was also invited to your Nangong Imperial Clan to be a guest.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, later on, not only did you all put forth the arrest order for that Chu Feng, you all even wanted him dead. You all ended up posting those wanted posters for that Chu Feng all over the entire Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly what sort of grievance, what sort of hatred, would make you all loathe that Chu Feng to that extent, would make you all be that ruthless?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After all, he is someone who showed grace and kindness to your Nangong Imperial Clan. Regardless of whether the grace and kindness he showed was large or small, it remained that he was your benefactor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When even a benefactor to your Nangong Imperial Clan is treated like that, how could I possibly dare to go and become your Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s guest?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After all, I have injured your two princes and your princess today. I could be considered to be your enemy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The hatred and killing intent all those seniors from your Nangong Imperial Clan directed toward me earlier, I believe I am not the only one who felt it. I believe that many of the people present also sensed it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I would like to ask, how could I possibly dare to go be a guest in your Nangong Imperial Clan?&#x201D; Chu Feng coldly asked.</p><p>Hearing those words, many of the people present began to nod their heads. They felt that what this young man called Feng Xing had said was reasonable. After all, they too had sensed the hatred and killing intent the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan had directed at him earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;What little friend Feng Xing said is reasonable. Nangong Beidou, if little friend Feng Xing is to stay in your clan as a guest, you will inevitably try to harm little friend Feng Xing.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief spoke with a serious expression. After saying those words, he secretly smiled. He had the expression of someone who was enjoying the show.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, indeed,&#x201D; Even the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief spoke to pour oil onto the fire.</p><p>Evidently, these two Clan Chiefs were all displeased by the words spoken by Nangong Beidou earlier. Thus, they seized this moment to retaliate against him.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
