<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 916 - A Mocking Laugh</strong></p><p><span style="">Feeling Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze, Lady Piaomiao turned her head over as well and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, my abilities are limited. I can only save you and Fuyan. If you want to go back, I won&#x2019;t stop you, but I&#x2019;ll leave you with some words.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Only by staying alive can you exact revenge. Otherwise, everything else you do will be useless.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes reddened. They moistened. But, he remained silent. He closed his eyes, allowing Lady Piaomiao to bring him away. He chose to leave.</span></p><p><span style="">Only when Lady Piaomiao flew far, when they could no longer see any traces of the Misty Peak, did the corner of Chu Feng&#x2019;s eye tremble slightly before the fall of a single tear.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Chu Feng clenched his hand, which held the rune.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom&#x2014;*</span></p><p><span style="">*huuuu&#x2014;*</span></p><p><span style="">An explosion erupted when the rune was crushed. A powerful shock wave wreaked havoc, and they interfered the lives of every being. Even Lady Piaomiao, who flew speedily in the air, was shaken by that shock wave. She swayed left and right, and almost fell from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Turning their heads, no matter Chu Feng, Qiushui Fuyan, or Lady Piaomiao, all of their pupils shrank. Their eyes widened, and their faces were full of shock.</span></p><p><span style="">At that very instant, only two words could describe the scene behind them: absolute chaos.</span></p><p><span style="">Above: black clouds rolled about, thunders rang out in bursts, as if the sky itself had been torn.</span></p><p><span style="">Below: the waves were surging, and the waves were roaring, as if there was some evil beast soon to be spawned.</span></p><p><span style="">Most importantly, as such change occurred to the sky above and the sea beneath, a visible barrier appeared. It sealed off everything in the direction of the Misty Peak, and separated Chu Feng and the others on the other side.</span></p><p><span style="">That barrier was like a wave. It was colourless, auraless, and if one gave it a careful detection, they would discover it was unmovable as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It succeeded! Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve succeeded! We&#x2019;ve succeeded!&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan was ecstatic. She was so excited she could nearly jump. She knew this was the thing the mysterious existence gave them. This was a technique of the mysterious existence. With this barrier, Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s strength didn&#x2019;t matter anymore. He was no longer able to catch up to them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D; Just at that moment, Jiang Qisha had been quickly rushing over. His first appearance was in the distant horizon, and after his second step, he had arrived before them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Jiang Qisha clearly noticed the barrier already. He kept some distance; he stood in the air, and with a fierce gaze, looked at the barrier that stopped his advance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, Qiushui, let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao said after seeing Jiang Qisha.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah.&#x201D; However, just after she finished speaking, her body tilted and she lost her ability to fly, beginning to fall from the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Piaomiao!&#x201D; Alarmed, Qiushui Fuyan quickly held her up.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, the light surrounding Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s body started disappearing. As it started fading away, Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s complexion also started to change.</span></p><p><span style="">Not only was her face starting to fill with wrinkles, her skin dried and was full of darkened spots, as if there weren&#x2019;t even have an ounce of water or life in her. Even her visage changed&#x2014;it became one full of scars. Those scars were extremely terrifying, and every single one was a horrid sight to behold.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart beat quicker upon seeing her change in state. An unspeakable fury surged forth. He knew this was Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s true appearance after living for nearly a thousand years. The scars on her face were the evidence left behind by Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s criminal actions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;</span><i><span style="">Cough cough cough&#x2026; </span></i><span style="">Go. Fuyan, quickly take Chu Feng away from this place,&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao said with a weak voice. In spite of her present state, she was still concerned with Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s and Chu Feng&#x2019;s safety.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D; With one hand supporting Lady Piaomiao, Qiushui Fuyan used the other to pull Chu Feng, and continued flying forward.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t even think of leaving!&#x201D; A chilly glint flashed in Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s eyes as he raised his hand and threw out a talisman.</span></p><p><span style="">The talisman rapidly changed as he flew in the air. As radiance swirled around it, it became a sharp blade dozens of meters long. It slashed through the air, and its might was terrifying. If struck, not to mention Qiushui Fuyan, it would mean an instant death for even Lady Piaomiao.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">However, when the sharp blade came into contact with the barrier, there was no explosion. As if engulfed by water, it was sucked in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, even Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s expression couldn&#x2019;t help changing. His face, filled with fury before, paled immediately. The chilly glint in his eyes not only disappeared, it was replaced by deep fear.</span></p><p><span style="">He couldn&#x2019;t help but back away. Quickly after, he carefully examined the barrier blocking his way in front of him. After a good while, the fear in his eyes faded away, and instead, his eyes surged with an indescribable excitement. He said, with a smile, &#x201C;Misty Peak? Some Misty Peak this is&#x2026; I didn&#x2019;t think there would be a treasure like this in such a worthless land.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How is it? They escaped?&#x201D; After a moment, someone came flying over&#x2014;it was Murong Mingtian. He looked at the scene before his eyes, and stared at the squirming barrier. He frowned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;With this thing in the way, would you be able to catch up?&#x201D; Jiang Qisha cast his gaze at Murong Mingtian.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Murong Mingtian felt rather speechless. He was no fool, so he could instantly tell how powerful that barrier was. And especially as a person who had cultivated in the Misty Peak, he knew even more what the world-sealing barrier represented.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You told me before that this Misty Peak is something from the Ancient Era. Now, I believe your words. Let&#x2019;s go. Let me see the things left behind in this place,&#x201D; Jiang Qisha said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Should we wait a bit longer? This thing shouldn&#x2019;t stay here forever,&#x201D; Murong Mingtian said as he pointed at the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if it disappears, they are already long gone. However, that old granny used a forbidden technique. Her cultivation will not be retained. Without her here, that woman and brat are two pieces of garbage. What do you need to fear?&#x201D; Jiang Qisha said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Actually&#x2026; the one I&#x2019;m truly worried about isn&#x2019;t Lady Piaomiao, nor Qiushui Fuyan. It&#x2019;s that boy called Chu Feng. You just don&#x2019;t know, but that brat is a monster, and his origin is an unknown. I have always suspected whether he is also a person that came from the Holy Land of Martialism, like you,&#x201D; Murong Mingtian said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Came from the Holy Land of Martialism? Him?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, hahaha, hahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing those words, Jiang Qisha burst with laughter. Moreover, he laughed very loudly, and very mockingly. Only after a good while did he say, &#x201C;You think that Chu Feng is qualified to have come from the Holy Land of Martialism?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
