<p><strong> Chapter 2401 - Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I am truly sorry for how unruly our Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation has behaved. This old man has truly failed in disciplining them&#x2026;&#x201D; Kong Shunlian walked over to Chu Feng and began to personally apologize to Chu Feng.</p><p>However, before Kong Shunlian could finish what he wanted to say, Chu Feng interrupted him with a smile on his face. &#x201C;Senior, you are being too courteous. This is merely a small matter. I, Chu Feng, never took it to heart. So, senior, please do not overthink this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, your heart is truly broad. This old man is filled with admiration,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian clasped his fist toward Chu Feng. He did not say those words casually. Rather, with his observation, he was able to tell that Chu Feng had truly not taken this matter to heart.</p><p>To be able to remain magnanimous like this after being insulted when invited over as an honored guest was something very difficult for even people of the older generation to accomplish, let alone a person of the younger generation like Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, this Chu Feng managed to obtain some comprehension today. I wish to enter closed-door training in the Kong Heavenly Clan for a period of time. Might that be possible?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;For little friend Chu Feng to plan to enter closed-door training here would mean that little friend Chu Feng is confident in our Kong Heavenly Clan. As such, there&#x2019;s definitely no issue at all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured, and enter closed-door training here at ease. I guarantee&#x2026; that regardless of whether it might be people from our Kong Heavenly Clan or others, none of them will bother you again,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng clasped his fist.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng and Kong Shunlian continued to chat for a moment. When Kong Shunlian and the others left, the inside and outside of the palace that served as Chu Feng&#x2019;s residence became very quiet.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, today has t-truly been to e-everyone&#x2019;s satisfaction. T-that guy by the name of Kong Ruozeng must&#x2019;ve n-never thought that he would s-suffer this e-enormously in his o-own territory. Hahaha, satisfying, truly immensely s-satisfying.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I t-truly want to s-see w-what sort of a-appearance he will h-have when u-undergoing t-that so-called medicinal punishment,&#x201D; At that moment, Wang Qiang was laughing in an extremely delighted manner.</p><p>However, Wang Qiang soon said, &#x201C;Merely, I s-saw that Kong R-Ruozeng look a-at you with an e-expression filled with g-grievances when he was d-dragged away. I&#x2019;m a-afraid that he will not l-leave the matter at that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He is but a brainless impertinent fellow that has been pampered for so long that he no longer knows the immensity of heaven and earth. There is simply no need to worry about someone like him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rather, we should be on guard against his father. Merely, I think they will not dare to do anything again in the Kong Heavenly Clan. Thus, at the very least, we&#x2019;ll be temporarily safe here,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, are w-we to&#x2026;&#x201D; Wang Qiang said.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, it is like you thought. We are going to finish the grand formation,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>After Chu Feng said those words, he revealed a smile of anticipation on his face.</p><p>He was not only looking forward to the treasures, he was also looking forward to the spirit formation itself. After all, that grand spirit formation was the most difficult and also the most amazing spirit formation Chu Feng had ever challenged so far.</p><p>In fact, that spirit formation was one that surpassed one&#x2019;s cultivation. After all&#x2026; that spirit formation was capable of avoiding the detection of even True Immortals.</p><p>Soon, the Kong Heavenly Clan released the news that Chu Feng and Wang Qiang had entered closed-door training.</p><p>After Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were announced to have entered closed-door training, even though there were still people coming to pay respects to them, they were all refused by the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>However, those people that came to pay respect to Chu Feng and Wang Qiang did not wish to journey here in vain. Thus, those with high statuses decided to directly stay in the Kong Heavenly Clan as guests.</p><p>Those with inferior levels of status who weren&#x2019;t qualified to stay in the Kong Heavenly Clan as guests decided to wait outside the Kong Heavenly Clan for news of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang exiting their closed-door training.</p><p>All of a sudden, a large group of people were gathered outside the Kong Heavenly Clan. It was a scene that was rarely seen.</p><p>Upon thinking of how those people had not gathered here for the Kong Heavenly Clan, but rather for two people from the younger generation, one could inevitably feel how extraordinary Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were.</p><p>Before this, there had only been a single member of the younger generation capable of causing all these seniors to come and pay him respect -- the exceptional genius Young Master Li Ming.</p><p>After Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were able to focus on setting up the spirit formation, their speed increased enormously.</p><p>Merely, that spirit formation was extremely powerful, so powerful that it could even avoid the detection of True Immortals. As such, it was naturally very difficult to set up.</p><p>Thus, even though Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were working together, it still took them several days to finish setting up the spirit formation.</p><p>Fortunately, they still managed to succeed.</p><p>At that moment, two golden-bright and dazzling bodies of light were floating on Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm.</p><p>They resembled two stars, and although their size was very small, they contained an unbounded amount of power.</p><p>This was the result of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&#x2019;s joint efforts of the past several days, the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.</p><p>As its name implied, once one donned this spirit formation, not even True Immortals would be able to detect them even if they were to walk right past them.</p><p>&#x201C;T-these t-two t-tiny things a-actually took us s-so long to make,&#x201D; Looking at the two bodies of light on Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm, Wang Qiang gasped with admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a spirit formation that can evade even True Immortals, naturally it will require a bit more time to complete,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;S-say, w-wouldn&#x2019;t we be a-able to sell these two items for a g-great amount of wealth if we were to sell them?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. Merely, we have no proof of our words. I fear that no one will trust us. After all, the effect of this spirit formation is quite unbelievable,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It can only be said that they are stupid and ignorant then. If they a-are unable to believe this Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation to be r-real, th-then wouldn&#x2019;t it mean that they would be s-scared to death once we b-become Snake Marked Immortal-cloak World Spiritists and set up that Immortal Burying Formation?&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with an expression of anticipation.</p><p>Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s successors. The two of them had obtained many powerful spirit formations from Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance.</p><p>Among the spirit formations they obtained was one by the name of Immortal Burying Formation. As its name implied, once the Immortal Burying Formation was set up, even True Immortals would end up losing their lives should they enter it. The Immortal Burying Formation was extremely powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;The Immortal Burying Formation is extremely hard. If we attempt to set it up as only Snake Marked Immortal-cloaked World Spiritists, I fear that it will be extremely difficult to set up. The amount of time it will take us to set it up would be immeasurable. Furthermore, even if we were able to successfully set it up, its might would definitely be limited,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;If t-the three of us a-are to join hands, I f-feel that it will be f-feasible.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;F-furthermore, if we r-really d-do set up that Immortal B-Burying Formation, no one in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would dare to disrespect us, no?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A-at that time, w-who would provoke us?&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with a face filled with resentment. It could be seen that Wang Qiang deeply remembered the times he was bullied by others.</p><p>&#x201C;Although there are very few Immortal-cloak World Spiritists in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, there are still Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, in terms of setting up a grand formation that can kill True Immortals, I reckon there is no one other than the Golden Crane True Immortal that is capable of doing that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we are truly able to set up the Immortal Burying Formation, we will definitely shock all the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Is t-that Golden C-Crane True Immortal really that powerful that he could set up something akin t-to the Immortal Burying Formation?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I feel that he is unfathomable. His strength is not something that the four tier one powers could compare to. However, strictly speaking, he is not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng had only met the Golden Crane True Immortal once, he believed the Golden Crane True Immortal to be extremely powerful. In fact, Chu Feng felt that the Golden Crane True Immortal might not only possess the cultivation of a True Immortal. After all, the title &#x2018;Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019; was only given to him by others, and not himself.</p><p>Of course, Chu Feng felt that the plain-clothed old monk should also be able to set up a spirit formation like the Immortal Burying Formation, or even one more powerful than the Immortal Burying Formation.</p><p>However, regardless of whether it might be the Golden Crane True Immortal or that plain-clothed old monk, the two of them would likely not setup those sorts of spirit formations even if they were capable of doing so. After all, the two of them possessed such overwhelmingly powerful cultivations; there was simply no need for them to set up a spirit formation, they would be able to kill True Immortals merely by relying on their martial cultivations.</p><p>Merely, as Chu Feng looked to the spiraling spirit formation in his hand, he still felt very excited.</p><p>After all, he was not a powerful True Immortal-level expert. Instead, he was a weak individual with the mere cultivation of a Half Martial Ancestor.</p><p>Suddenly, Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s voice was heard. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong? Why have you been staring at that spirit formation the entire time?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Eggy, before this, I truly never expected that I would be able to set up such a powerful spirit formation. I am still only a Half Martial Ancestor. Yet, I am now able to avoid the detection of True Immortals. It would appear that the power of world spiritists is truly amazing,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Eggy.</p><p>&#x201C;World spiritists are naturally amazing. Martial cultivation is something that everyone can accomplish. However, not just anyone can become a world spiritist. As such, world spiritists should naturally be more powerful than martial cultivators.</p><p>&#x201C;The reason why you did not notice the greatness of world spiritists before was because you were too weak as a world spiritist, and the spirit formations that you knew were too weak as well.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I can tell you with certainty. From what I&#x2019;ve heard, world spiritists are extremely powerful. As long a world spiritist is given a sufficient amount of time, they will not even be afraid of expert martial cultivators much more powerful than them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you have yet to encounter a world spiritist that powerful. They are existences far beyond you. Thus, regardless of how much I describe them to you, you will not necessarily be able to understand. However, you merely need to think of your mother. By thinking of your mother, you should be able to realize what sort of strength the powerful world spiritists possess,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;My mother?&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was moved.</p><p>According to Xue Ji, his mother had been capable of tearing the Asura Spirit World apart and snatching world spirits from there by force.</p><p>What sort of place was the Asura Spirit World? It was the strongest of the seven spirit worlds. The world spirits in that place were extremely powerful.</p><p>It was precisely because of that that it showed how powerful Chu Feng&#x2019;s mother was.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
