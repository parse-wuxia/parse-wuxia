<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1787 - Killing Intention</strong></p><p>&#x201C;If that boy Zhang Tianyi wants to obtain the title of the Strongest of the Younger Generation, it will not be that easy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That Underworld Palace&#x2019;s Underworld Messenger Kuang cannot be considered to be much. His greatest opponents would be you and Leng Yue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Especially you. If you were to be serious, and not lose on purpose, it would be impossible for that Zhang Tianyi to defeat you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the outcome of this battle will determine whether or not Zhang Tianyi will be able to make progress in his cultivation. With how loyal to one&apos;s friends you are, you will definitely try to help him attain victory.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you were to deliberately lose to him, it would be disrespectful toward him. Thus, it would be better for you to withdraw from the battle beforehand.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if you were to withdraw, you would be afraid that Zhang Tianyi might not be a match for Leng Yue. Thus, you plan to pull Leng Yue down with you by being disqualified from the competition by breaking the rules with her.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, you plan to avenge Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang at the same time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In addition, you had made this decision before this Queen even woke back up,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of Milady Queen. You&#x2019;re truly sharp,&#x201D; Chu Feng was truly feeling the urge to clap his hands in applause to his Queen.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;ve said that you&#x2019;ve made your decision, would this queen&#x2019;s advice even be of use?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Depends on the subject,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What if it&#x2019;s this matter?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng laughed mischievously. He did not answer Eggy directly. However, he had made it known what his attitude was toward this matter.</p><p>As this matter concerned Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s future, even though he would be placed in a difficult situation should Eggy advise against it, he would still go and do it.</p><p>Eggy sighed. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve gotten used to it. You&#x2019;re someone who cares about your nonsense camaraderie enormously.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This Queen is very displeased, because by doing so you are giving up on your own interests.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, I am still against your decision even now. But, you are, after all, my master. As such, I should respect your decision.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do as you wish, I&#x2019;ll support you,&#x201D; Eggy said those words with a tone of helplessness.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, Milady Queen,&#x201D; Seeing that Eggy did not try to stop him, and was instead supporting him, Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief. Like this, he would be able to go and do what he wanted without worries.</p><p>&#x201C;The one I&#x2019;m fighting this time is not an ordinary person. Instead, she is Leng Yue, the number one disciple of the Heavenly Law Palace, someone who plays a critical role in the Heavenly Law Palace.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I am to avenge senior brother Zhang and little brother Wushang, I must humiliate her. However, she is also someone who cannot be humiliated.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I must possess an absolute certainty of success before doing anything. As for this&#x2026; I will need Milady Queen&#x2019;s help,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;So you already have a plan?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;You can start then. This Queen has wanted to do some stretching and move her limbs after having been asleep for so long,&#x201D; Impatience appeared on Eggy&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Afterward, Chu Feng spent two entire hours setting up a spirit formation. Then, using treasures to conceal it, he changed the appearance of the spirit formation into that of a ring, and placed it on Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s finger.</p><p>After observing that unremarkable-looking ring on her finger, Eggy asked skeptically, &#x201C;Merely this will do?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s also this,&#x201D; Chu Feng took out a spittoon-shaped item. There was another spirit formation within it. An unknown substance was sealed within the spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;What is this?&#x201D; Eggy asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll know,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile.</p><p>&#x201C;These two items are the absolute certainty of yours?&#x201D; Eggy asked skeptically.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, they&#x2019;ll be sufficient,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he had Eggy return to his world spirit space. After that, he walked out of his pagoda and began to proceed toward the location that Leng Yue had designated.</p><p>Although they were in the central region of the fort, there were still secluded places. Although Leng Yue was prepared to be disqualified, she did not wish for others to disturb the battle between her and Chu Feng. Thus, she had chosen a relatively hidden location.</p><p>After Chu Feng arrived in the hidden forest, he looked to the little brook before him.</p><p>Suddenly, he said, &#x201C;No matter what, you are still the disciple of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. Is there a need for you to be this sneaky? If there&#x2019;s something that you wish to say, go ahead and say it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; After Chu Feng said those words, a slight snort sounded from the forest behind him. Soon, a figure walked out from the forest. Sure enough, it was the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&#x2019;s disciple, Baili Xinghe.</p><p>&#x201C;For you to follow me this sneakily, what matter might you have?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I know the relationship you have with junior sister Zi Ling and junior sister Su Rou,&#x201D; Baili Xinghe said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Chu Feng was rather surprised. Then, he asked, &#x201C;What about it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I feel that you do not suit them. Thus, I wish that you sever your relationship with them. From today on, you are to not disturb them,&#x201D; Baili Xinghe said.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. A trace of chilliness flashed through his eyes.</p><p>Chu Feng was very smart. After hearing those words, he already knew Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s intentions. The reason why this guy had such great hostility toward him was because he had taken a fancy to Chu Feng&#x2019;s women, Zi Ling and Su Rou.</p><p>The reason why he came to find Chu Feng and said those words to him was evidently because he had been rejected by Zi Ling and Su Rou. Without any alternative, he had decided to come and threaten Chu Feng.</p><p>It was one thing for him to fall for his women. After all, regardless of what Zi Ling and Su Rou&#x2019;s cultivations might be, they were two exceptional beauties.</p><p>Noblemen fancied sweet, fair and graceful ladies. This was nothing major.</p><p>However, this Baili Xinghe actually, for the sake of obtaining Chu Feng&#x2019;s women, came to threaten Chu Feng.</p><p>As a man, how could Chu Feng endure this?</p><p>As such, the anger in Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was surging already, and on the verge of exploding. However, Chu Feng did not reveal any of that.</p><p>Instead, with a light smile on his face, he said, &#x201C;Baili Xinghe, go and take a piss, then use that as a mirror to look at yourself. After that, use your brain that is filled with dogshit to think about it. How are you qualified to come and say these words to me, Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s gaze flashed, and he began to tightly clench his fists. Although he was extremely angry, he involuntarily recalled the scene of being rejected by Zi Ling and Su Rou.</p><p>It was the first time in Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s life that he had experienced such ruthlessness. Before them, not a single woman had ever rejected him.</p><p>Thus, his feelings for Zi Ling and Su Rou were one-sided. As for Zi Ling and Su Rou, they were dead set on Chu Feng. Indeed&#x2026; he did not have the qualifications to say those words to Chu Feng.</p><p>However, the things that he, Baili Xinghe, wished to obtain must be obtained. This included women.</p><p>As for now, the only way for him to obtain them was through Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;d best do as I say,&#x201D; Baili Xinghe said with a cold snort. His tone was filled with threat.</p><p>&#x201C;What if I don&#x2019;t?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Then I&#x2019;ll kill you,&#x201D; Upon saying those words, coldness flashed through Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s eyes. A boundless killing intent smashed into Chu Feng.</p><p>This Baili Xinghe was not joking around. He was really planning to kill Chu Feng for the sake of obtaining Zi Ling and Su Rou.</p><p>&#x201C;Come, give it a try then,&#x201D; The corners of Chu Feng&#x2019;s mouth were raised slightly. However, behind his smile was a deep killing intent.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
