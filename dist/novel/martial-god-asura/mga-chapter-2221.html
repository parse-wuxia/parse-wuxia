<p><strong> Chapter 2221 - Provocation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Jiang Hao, what are you saying?! They are my friends! Furthermore, Chu Feng is not a part of the Red Butterfly Society,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said in a displeased manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone not from the Red Butterfly Society was actually capable of obtaining an invitation? It seems that you&#x2019;re very rich?&#x201D; That Jiang Hao said to Chu Feng in a very mocking manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Jiang Hao, you are truly too ill-informed and narrow-minded. It seems that you have never heard of brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s past achievements,&#x201D; Right at that moment, another of the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s male disciples stepped forward.</p><p>Chu Feng knew that the person that spoke was called Li Rui.</p><p>However, different from Jiang Hao, this Li Rui did not emit any hostility toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, merely someone from a third tier power. I am not interested in their past achievements,&#x201D; Jiang Hao said with contempt. He was emitting his superiority of a tier two power&#x2019;s management elder&#x2019;s personal disciple all over.</p><p>The three Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s female disciples began to chuckle. Although they did not say any mocking words, it could be seen that they also looked down upon Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli.</p><p>As for those four elders, it remained that they were experienced individuals. Thus, they remained very calm and collected. It was as if they were mere observers. They neither said anything, nor displayed any mocking behavior.</p><p>However, at the same time, they also did not reprimand Jiang Hao for his rudeness. Even that Elder Ning Shuang did not reprimand Jiang Hao.</p><p>&#x201C;Not interested? You&#x2019;re not interested in even an Asura World Spiritist?&#x201D; Li Rui said.</p><p>&#x201C;Asura World Spiritist?&#x201D; Upon hearing those words, that Jiang Hao&#x2019;s expression immediately changed. Then he chuckled and said, &#x201C;You couldn&#x2019;t possibly be implying that Chu Feng is an Asura World Spiritist, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t conceal this from you. Brother Chu Feng is indeed an Asura World Spiritist. Right now, not many people know about this yet. However, it will definitely spread through the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm in the future,&#x201D; Li Rui said.</p><p>&#x201C;Asura World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you really an Asura World Spiritist?&#x201D; At that moment, the three women who had had expressions of contempt on their faces immediately changed their expressions and began to voluntarily attempt to communicate with Chu Feng.</p><p>Even those four elders had a change in their expressions. Involuntarily, they began to size Chu Feng up seriously.</p><p>&#x201C;You all do not have to ask anymore. Chu Feng is indeed an Asura World Spiritist. Furthermore, his world spirit is extremely powerful. Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion&#x2019;s Hong Xi was killed by Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, so what if that is the case? There are countless promising young geniuses. However, the great majority of them end up dying young or prematurely. Only the geniuses that are able to grow up are the true geniuses. Else, they&#x2019;re nothing more than dog farts,&#x201D; Jiang Hao said.</p><p>&#x201C;Jiang Hao, why do your words seem to contain such a great amount of grievances? Could it be that you&#x2019;re jealous of Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, everyone knows that you like Junior Sister Yiyi. You&#x2019;re afraid that Junior Sister Yiyi will be snatched away by Chu Feng, and decided to attack him, right?&#x201D;</p><p>Before Xu Yiyi and Li Rui could say anything, those three female disciples already began to speak on behalf of Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng felt helpless toward this change. They only had such an enormous change in their attitudes because of the fact that he was an Asura World Spiritist.</p><p>Snobbish. They were definitely doing this for their own self-interest. Thus, even though they were helping him, Chu Feng did not feel any sense of gratefulness toward them.</p><p>It was not that Chu Feng was an ungrateful person. Rather, Chu Feng knew that they were people that would not help him should he encounter actual troubles.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph. I&#x2019;m telling you all, this place is Mount Cloud Crane. What we compare here are one&#x2019;s world spirit techniques. If one&#x2019;s world spirit techniques are insufficient, even if one is an Asura World Spiritist, it is of no use.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That place, do you all see that? Don&#x2019;t you think that you will definitely be able to enter Mount Cloud Crane just because you hold an invitation title plate. If your strength is insufficient, you will still be asked to leave,&#x201D; Jiang Hao declared as he pointed to Mount Cloud Crane&#x2019;s entrance.</p><p>That place was very far away, and very difficult to see with the naked eye. However, all the people present were world spiritists. After using their special observation methods, they were able to see that there was a row of spirit formations before the entrance.</p><p>Each one of the spirit formations was an entrance. There were a total of several tens of such spirit formation entrances.</p><p>If one wished to pass through the spirit formation entrance, one must hold an invitation title plate. However, strangely, even though everyone was holding one such invitation title plate, some people were able to successfully enter, whereas others were sent back. Furthermore, after being sent back, their invitation title plates also disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Why are those people all being sent back? Could it be that their invitation title plates were fake?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;No, their invitation title plates are not fake. Rather, those spirit formations possess special requirements. Likely, only those that satisfy the requirements are allowed to enter Mount Cloud Crane.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that just having an invitation title plate is not enough for one to enter that place to train,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What? There&#x2019;s actually such a rule? Why didn&#x2019;t they say this beforehand? This is truly bullshit,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi had a displeased expression.</p><p>After all, she knew very well how strong her world spirit techniques were. If one truly had to satisfy a certain requirement to enter, she felt that she would definitely not be able to pass through the spirit formation entrances. Even though she possessed an invitation title plate, she would&#x2019;ve come in vain.</p><p>&#x201C;You all see that, right? Even if one is a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist and possesses an invitation title plate, you will still be refused entrance if your world spirit techniques are insufficient.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mister Asura World Spiritist, let me ask you, are you still that confident now? C&#x2019;mon, tell me frankly, are you scared witless now?&#x201D; Jiang Hao said to Chu Feng provocatively.</p><p>&#x201C;Scared? You should be the one that&#x2019;s scared, no?&#x201D; Chu Feng replied calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Me, scared? I, Jiang Hao, started learning world spirit techniques since when I was ten years old. Right now, I have meticulously studied world spirit techniques for eighty-one years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have relied on my actual abilities to become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for you, haha&#x2026; it is not that I am looking down on you but, becoming a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist at your age, I believe you should know best whether or not you&#x2019;ve obtained assistance from others.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although your world spirit techniques might appear to be on par with us, the difference will show immediately the moment you use them,&#x201D; Jiang Hao said to Chu Feng with a face filled with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;Jiang Hao, if you dare to act rudely towards my friend again, do not blame me for becoming impolite,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said in a very annoyed manner. She was truly angry.</p><p>&#x201C;Yiyi, it is truly not that I am trying to act rude towards your friend. Rather, I just want him to know the truth, and not become overly conceited, because that will end up delaying his future prospects,&#x201D; Jiang Hao explained.</p><p>&#x201C;Conceited? The way I see it, you&#x2019;re the one that&#x2019;s conceited, no?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said without the slightest trace of politeness.</p><p>&#x201C;What Junior Sister Yiyi said is extremely reasonable.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Jiang Hao, you are the one acting high and aloof from the very beginning. Chu Feng has been extremely low profile compared to you,&#x201D; Those three women chuckled.</p><p>What caused Chu Feng to feel the most speechless was that while those three women were speaking on his behalf, they were also throwing flirtatious glances at him. They were nearly on the verge of brazenly telling Chu Feng that they wanted him.</p><p>&#x201C;If you all do not believe me, I shall prove it to you all now. I, Jiang Hao, am someone with actual abilities. It will be extremely easy for me to pass through that entrance. As for you, Chu Feng, hehe&#x2026; good luck,&#x201D; Jiang Hao cast a glance at Chu Feng, then rapidly flew toward the spirit formation gate with his invitation title plate in hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Truly a crazy fellow. What does him being able to enter or not have anything to do with Chu Feng?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior Sister Yiyi, Jiang Hao is only acting this hostile towards Brother Chu Feng because he likes you. After all, you were truly enthusiastic when you saw Brother Chu Feng,&#x201D; Li Rui laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;Pah! Don&#x2019;t disgust me with that. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that his master was a fellow apprentice to my master, and has maintained a decent relationship with him the entire time, I would&#x2019;ve already asked my master to kill him with a palm strike. How could I continue to allow him to buzz around me like a housefly all day?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi was so furious that her little face turned deep red. It could be seen that she was extremely fed up with Jiang Hao.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
