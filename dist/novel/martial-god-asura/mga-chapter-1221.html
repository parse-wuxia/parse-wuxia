<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1221 - You Were Lying</strong></p><p>When the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram appeared before the crowd, everyone became extremely excited. Only Chu Feng was a bit absent-minded, feeling indifferent and not as focused on the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.</p><p>As he had trained in the Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes for such a long time, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes had become a lot more sensitive. Even if he did not use his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, his eyesight still surpassed that of ordinary people.</p><p>Thus, even without using his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram was no ordinary item, and that it would require one to pay quite a bit of a price to activate it, even if one was to use royal-level spirit energy to do so.</p><p>Even though Sima Huolie was powerful, it was likely that he would not be able to make the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram display what it actually possessed by himself.</p><p>Sure enough, after a short moment, Sima Huolie was already sweating profusely. He turned over to Elder Hong Mo and loudly shouted. &#x201C;Old fellow Hong Mo, stop watching from the sidelines. Quickly, come over and lend me a hand!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You, I knew that you would not call me over without ulterior motives. Sure enough, you wanted me to exert myself, you called me over so that I could do laborious work for you.&#x201D; Elder Hong Mo seemed to have already anticipated this.</p><p>However, he did not complain excessively. Instead, with a movement of his body, he arrived in the air and sat down in a cross-legged position. A boundless amount of royal-level spirit energy began to surge out of his body and enter the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.</p><p>After four whole hours, the two royal-cloak world spiritists poured a great amount of their spirit energy into the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram and were covered with sweat. Even their expressions turned pale.</p><p>Yet, even though great change had occurred within the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram, it had yet to show its profoundness; it had yet to be completely activated.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s no good, Huolie. This Nine Spirits Divine Diagram is like a bottomless pit. There seems to be no limit to its ability to devour our spirit energy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The vilest thing is that it seems to be deliberately making us feel that we will be able to activate it, should we pour more spirit energy into it. This feels exactly like a trap. A trap to lure us in.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It was like this back then, and it is still like this now. Even though the degree is much less, its nature remains the same.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huolie, didn&#x2019;t you say that you&#x2019;d already managed to unseal the protective screen on this Nine Spirits Divine Diagram? In that case, why is it still acting like this? Like this, it&#x2019;s simply impossible for us to see its true colors.&#x201D; Elder Hong Mo stopped and spoke of words of complaint.</p><p>&#x201C;Sigh, old fellow Hong Mo, you cannot blame me for this. Over these past years, I have truly been researching this Nine Spirits Divine Diagram incessantly. Furthermore, I did manage to make some progress.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I originally thought that I had succeeded, and that we could break apart the protective screen and activate the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram as long as we provided with it enough spirit energy. However, it would appear that it&#x2019;s still no good.&#x201D; Sima Huolie scratched his head in an embarrassed manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Huolie, so it turned out after all this that you&#x2019;re also uncertain about the outcome. In that case, what do you plan to do now? Have we come here in vain?&#x201D; Elder Hong Mo was a bit uneasy. He felt as if he had been scammed.</p><p>As the matter stood, Chu Feng and the others finally understood that even though the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram contained profound mysteriousness, it was not that easy for them to see the contents within. At the very least, the two royal-cloak world spiritists did not possess the capability to open it.</p><p>When they thought of this, everyone present, including Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen, displayed expressions of disappointment.</p><p>&#x201C;Old fellow Hong Mo, don&#x2019;t be so anxious. Since I&#x2019;ve called you over, I naturally hold a certain amount of certainty.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Come, come, come. If you don&#x2019;t trust me, then look at this diagram here. If we are to set up the formation according to this, I&#x2019;m certain we&#x2019;ll be able to open the protective screen.&#x201D; As Sima Huolie spoke, he took out an ancient and unadorned scroll diagram from his bosom and handed it over to Elder Hong Mo.</p><p>Originally, Elder Hong Mo was skeptical about this. However, after he saw the contents of the scroll diagram, his eyes immediately shone. He said, &#x201C;Huolie, where did you obtain this formation diagram? Could it be you&#x2019;ve asked the World Spiritists Alliance for help?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As a grand royal-cloak world spiritist, how could I possibly go and ask someone for help? This scroll diagram is something that I obtained in the Nine Spirits Paradise. I suspect it is most definitely something that the master of this Nine Spirits Divine Diagram left behind. Merely, I discovered it a bit late.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What do you think? Do you want to stay here for a couple more days and set up this formation with me? As long as this formation is completed, I&#x2019;m certain we will be able to open the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram and see the mysteriousness contained within it,&#x201D; Sima Huolie said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, this formation is indeed very profound, and seems to be a match for the Nine Spirits Divina Diagram&#x2019;s protective screen.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since I&#x2019;ve come all this way, staying a few more days would not amount to much,&#x201D; Elder Hong Mo nodded and agreed.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and the other members of the Medicine Concocting Department were also very happy. They had journeyed far and long to this place, all for the sake of seeing the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram. If they were to leave like this, it would truly have been too fruitless of a journey.</p><p>However, if the chance to see the profound mysteriousness of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram was there, then even if they were to stay for several more days, none of them would object to it.</p><p>After the decision was made, Chu Feng and the others all stayed. However, because Sima Huolie and Elder Hong Mo needed to remain in the cave to set up the formation, and Sima Ying felt that it was beneath herself to entertain Chu Feng and the others, it fell to the Nine Spirits Paradise&#x2019;s servants to arrange Chu Feng and the others&#x2019; residences.</p><p>By the arrangement made by the servants, Chu Feng was assigned to a residence with pretty decent scenery. It was a bamboo house located on an overhanging cliff. Across from it was a waterfall. The scenery was truly charming.</p><p>However, at this moment, Chu Feng did not have the heart to enjoy the beautiful scenery. That was because he needed to entertain three guests. One of them was Bai Ruochen. As for the other two, they were Elder Wei and Elder Zhou Quan.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, this old man here was ignorant before and felt prejudice against you. I hope that you will not take offense to my previous actions,&#x201D; Elder Zhou said with an ashamed expression.</p><p>After he saw Chu Feng&#x2019;s medicine concocting techniques, he already held a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng, and felt a great amount of regret for his previous conduct and deeds. He had come to Chu Feng&#x2019;s place precisely so that he could apologize to him.</p><p>As a grand management elder, he was actually able to lower his head down to a disciple. He was simply filled with sincerity.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Zhou, what sort of words are those? You are an elder, it is natural for you to speak if this disciple is in the wrong. Thus, it is actually I who am in the wrong because I did not learn properly.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng pandered to Elder Zhou Quan with a smile. It was not because he feared Elder Zhou Quan. Instead, it was because he managed to feel the change in Elder Zhou Quan&#x2019;s attitude toward him; Elder Zhou Quan was sincerely trying to befriend Chu Feng.</p><p>As the saying goes, &#x2018;where it is possible to let people off, one should spare them.&#x2019; As Elder Zhou Quan was sincerely trying to befriend Chu Feng, there was no reason for Chu Feng to refuse him. After all, Elder Zhou Quan was a management elder, and also a member of the Medicine Concocting Department. It would be a good thing for them to pacify their relationship.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhou Quan, it&#x2019;s enough. Chu Feng is not a narrow-minded individual. There&#x2019;s no need for you to mention these things again.&#x201D; Elder Wei laughed out loud. He was also very happy that Elder Zhou Quan thought so highly of Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I truly never imagined that your medicine concocting techniques would be this amazing. Especially in your ability to concoct High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets, it surpasses even Old Wei and I. May I know where you learned them from?&#x201D; Elder Zhou Quan asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Chu Feng, where did you learn it from? Where did you learn such an exquisite medicine concocting technique that allows you to actually be able to concoct so many High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets in such a short amount of time?&#x201D; Elder Wei also asked curiously.</p><p>Seeing this, Chu Feng felt a bit embarrassed. However, when faced with the expressions of anticipation from the two elders, he had no choice but to answer.</p><p>After considering it over and over again, he said, &#x201C;Actually, it was a coincidence. This junior managed to obtain a medicine concocting technique from a certain location. As for that medicine concocting technique, it just so happened to be for concocting High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As Chu Feng is fond of world spirit techniques, I ended up wholeheartedly learning this medicine concocting technique after obtaining it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, I was fortunate that Sima Ying decided to compete with me in concocting High Quality Strength Restoring Pellets. If it had been anything else, I fear that I might have been the one losing instead.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? Such a thing actually happened? In that case, it was simply the will of the heavens! It is the heavens that wanted that girl Sima Ying to lose. Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Elder Wei and Elder Zhou Quan burst into loud laughter. They were laughing extremely happily. The two of them felt that Sima Ying had lost because she had been unlucky. Furthermore, they were pleased by her misfortune.</p><p>After this, the two elders chatted with Chu Feng for quite a while before leaving. As for Bai Ruochen, she had been standing to the side the entire time.</p><p>Only when the two elders left did Bai Ruochen squint her eyes. She looked at Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you were lying.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
