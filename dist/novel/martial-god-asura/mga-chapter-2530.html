<p><strong> Chapter 2530 - Farewell</strong></p><p>After approaching, Chu Feng began to see the grand formation that had trapped Young Master Li Ming more clearly.</p><p>That grand formation was a very powerful slaughtering formation.</p><p>Although that slaughtering formation was visible at the moment, from the traces surrounding it, Chu Feng was able to determine that it should have been hidden before.</p><p>Not to mention Young Master Li Ming being trapped by the slaughtering formation, if Chu Feng had not obtained the safe route from Ying Mingchao, he likely would not have been able to discover that slaughtering formation either.</p><p>At that moment, the slaughtering formation had trapped Young Master Li Ming within it, and its various mechanisms and traps were also activated. Countless sharp swords formed by the slaughtering formation had surrounded Young Master Li Ming with the intention of skewering her.</p><p>Those sharp swords were no ordinary swords. If one were to be struck by them, it would be very difficult to heal the injuries they would cause. Even one&#x2019;s soul would suffer damage. One would truly and inevitably die should one be struck by those swords.</p><p>Furthermore, the slaughtering formation was extremely powerful. Unless one&#x2019;s cultivation had reached True Immortal realm, regardless of how strong one&#x2019;s martial power might be, it would be useless.</p><p>Fortunately, that Young Master Li Ming was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. By relying on her world spirit techniques and spirit formations, she was still barely able to deal with the slaughtering formation. Else&#x2026; she would really end up suffering a calamity.</p><p>It could be said that, Young Master Li Ming was trapped in a crisis. She was currently going all-out with her world spirit techniques to confront the crisis before her. As such, she did not notice Chu Feng&#x2019;s approach.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, girl, what are you doing?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.</p><p>Hearing those words, Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s expression changed instantly. She cast her extremely sharp gaze to Chu Feng.</p><p>At the beginning, it was only a gaze of alertness. However, Chu Feng was able to sense that the moment Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s gaze landed on him, her gaze turned from one of alertness to one filled with killing intent.</p><p>However, she merely took a single glance at Chu Feng before retrieving her gaze. She did not even bother to utter a word. She was reacting as if she hadn&#x2019;t seen him.</p><p>&#x201C;Girl, it will be very difficult for you to escape from this spirit formation by yourself. However, if I am to help you, you&#x2019;ll be able to escape much more easily.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While I can help you out, you must disregard your former hatred towards me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Young Master Li Ming was still completely silent. It was as if she could not hear Chu Feng.</p><p>Although Young Master Li Ming was ignoring Chu Feng, Chu Feng continued with a smile on his face, &#x201C;This slaughtering formation is no small matter. It&#x2019;ll be very difficult for you to break free relying only on your own strength.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need for your concern,&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming spoke coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Apologies, you cannot determine what I want to do,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s expression changed. Then, she swept her gaze filled with overwhelming killing intent toward Chu Feng.</p><p>However, upon seeing Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s reaction, the smile on Chu Feng&#x2019;s face grew more and more concentrated. Then, he began to move his arms, and waves of spirit power started to emerge from his body.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit power was like a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses whereas, Chu Feng himself was like the commander of that magnificent army.</p><p>Under Chu Feng&#x2019;s control, the vast amount of spirit power soon started to change form. It turned into a hundred dazzling golden rhinoceroses.</p><p>Those one hundred golden rhinoceroses were all several tens of meters tall. There were chains on their bodies that connected them with one another.</p><p>This was a grand formation, a grand formation that specialized in breaking through slaughtering formations.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s expression changed. As a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, she was naturally able to tell how amazing Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation was. Chu Feng&#x2026; was planning to help her.</p><p>&#x201C;If you want to break free from this slaughtering formation, you must cooperate with me to attack it from both sides. Else&#x2026; it will produce the opposite of the desired result,&#x201D; Chu Feng reminded.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if you are to help me, I will not be grateful towards you,&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming said coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t need you to feel grateful towards me,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he set his grand formation in motion.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The hundred golden rhinoceroses formed by Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation seemed to be living creatures as they roared.</p><p>Then, the horns of those hundred golden rhinoceroses started to shine brightly. At that moment, their horns seemed greatly increased in size.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;...</p><p>Then, loud consecutive explosions began to be heard. The hundred golden rhinoceroses had all smashed into various locations on the slaughtering formation.</p><p>In response, that Young Master Li Ming immediately started to cooperate with Chu Feng from the inside. She increased the strength of her own spirit formations.</p><p>With the joint effort from the two, the slaughtering formation was finally breached after a loud explosion was heard.</p><p>&#x201C;Prepare to die!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, that Young Master Li Ming suddenly shot forth a palm strike directly toward Chu Feng.</p><p>Once that palm strike was shot forth, it brought with it overwhelming martial power. The martial power turned into an enormous hand ten meters tall that moved toward Chu Feng to oppress him.</p><p>It was like a golden-bright and dazzling little mountain was about to crush Chu Feng alive.</p><p>That Young Master Li Ming was trying to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>That said, Chu Feng was not startled, nor was he afraid when faced with the situation before him. Instead&#x2026; he had a very confident expression. It was as if he had anticipated all of it.</p><p>&#x201C;Zzzzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Lightning flashed as radiance filled their surroundings. Chu Feng&#x2019;s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared on his body together.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation was no longer that of a rank eight Martial Ancestor. In fact, it had even surpassed that of ordinary rank nine Martial Ancestors.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng waved his sleeve. With merely that simple move, Chu Feng had managed to instantly shatter the incoming enormous golden hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Girl, I&#x2019;m afraid that it will be very difficult for the current you to kill the current me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Young Master Li Ming with a beaming smile.</p><p>Young Master Li Ming was very powerful. Her cultivation was that of an actual peak Martial Ancestor, a rank nine Martial Ancestor.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he was only a rank eight Martial Ancestor. When compared to Young Master Li Ming, his cultivation was an entire level lower.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was a Heavenly Bloodline possessor. Thus&#x2026; while he might only be a rank eight Martial Ancestor, once he utilized his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, his battle power became a level above that of Young Master Li Ming.</p><p>This was one of the reasons why Chu Feng had decided to save Young Master Li Ming knowing fully that she would try to kill him afterward.</p><p>That is, Chu Feng was certain that she would not be able to kill him.</p><p>&#x201C;What makes you think that I cannot kill you?&#x201D;</p><p>After Young Master Li Ming finished saying those words, nine-colored lightning began to flicker in her eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Zzzzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The next moment, Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings emerged on Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s body.</p><p>At that moment, Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s battle power had surpassed Chu Feng&#x2019;s by a level.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re actually also a Heavenly Bloodline possessor?&#x201D; Chu Feng was greatly astonished.</p><p>Before that, he had truly never anticipated that Young Master Li Ming would also be a Heavenly Bloodline possessor.</p><p>&#x201C;I never once said that I wasn&#x2019;t a Heavenly Bloodline possessor,&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming spoke indifferently.</p><p>&#x201C;This is embarrassing then,&#x201D; Chu Feng scratched his head with a smile. Then, he said to Young Master Li Ming, &#x201C;Could you pretend that I&#x2019;ve never been here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What do you think?&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming replied coldly. The killing intent in her eyes grew even more intense.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, it would seem that&#x2019;s a no then. It can&#x2019;t be helped then.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this, Chu Feng clenched his fists. Then, he began to move, and explosions began to be heard from all over his body.</p><p>Seeing Chu Feng like this, Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s gaze also changed. Being experienced in battle, she knew that Chu Feng was warming up his body, that he was planning to fight her.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, an azure dragon suddenly appeared below Chu Feng&#x2019;s feet.</p><p>With a move of that azure dragon&#x2019;s tail, and with Chu Feng still standing atop it, it began to flee toward the depths of the Demon Elimination Cave.</p><p>&#x201C;Girl, farewell!!!&#x201D;</p><p>It turned out that Chu Feng did not plan to fight Young Master Li Ming. Instead, he planned to escape.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Young Master Li Ming grew extremely furious. How could she be willing to allow Chu Feng to escape? With overwhelming killing intent, she began to chase after Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
