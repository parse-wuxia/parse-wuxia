<p><strong> Chapter 2506 - Voluntary Exploration</strong></p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s enough, there&#x2019;s no need for you to be this courteous here. It would be fine for you to just address me as Golden Crane,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal spoke in a somewhat annoyed manner.</p><p>Compared to his attitude toward Chu Feng, the Golden Crane True Immortal was not at all polite toward Chu Xuanlang.</p><p>However, Chu Xuanlang did not reveal the slightest big of displeasure. Instead, he nodded his head respectfully. His appearance could be said to be extremely humble.</p><p>&#x201C;Lead the way,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Chu Xuanlang nodded again.</p><p>Then, the Golden Crane True Immortal and Chu Feng started to follow Chu Xuanlang toward the location where Wang Qiang was.</p><p>Upon arriving, the Golden Crane True Immortal requested that he not be disturbed when healing Wang Qiang&#x2019;s injuries. Thus, Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Chu Xuanlang could only wait outside.</p><p>At that moment, Zhao Hong was walking back and forth high in the sky atop the clouds. An expression of unease filled her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Seems like your relationship has grown much closer,&#x201D; Chu Feng said jokingly upon seeing how worried Zhao Hong was.</p><p>&#x201C;If Wang Qiang had not tried to save me, he would not have ended up like this. The one to be injured should have been me. It was him who moved before me to block the attack, to suffer for me. If something is to truly happen to him, I&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>As Zhao Hong spoke, her eyes started to grow red as sparkling and translucent teardrops began to roll down her beautiful face.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Hong, don&#x2019;t worry too excessively. Since Senior Golden Crane is willing to help, Wang Qiang will definitely be fine,&#x201D; Seeing Zhao Hong&#x2019;s reaction, Chu Feng stopped trying to joke around and began to immediately comfort her.</p><p>&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; Zhao Hong was still doubtful. It was not because she did not believe in Chu Feng. Rather, it was because she was truly too worried for Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;If even the Golden Crane True Immortal cannot save Wang Qiang, then there will not be anyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm capable of saving Wang Qiang,&#x201D; Chu Xuanlang said.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, the space before them started to tremble slightly. Then, the Golden Crane True Immortal walked out.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, how was it?&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing him, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong hurriedly rushed forth.</p><p>At that moment, the Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s expression was slightly ugly. He shook his head, sighed and said, &#x201C;The situation is bad.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, could it be that even you are unable to save Wang Qiang?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng and Zhao Hong immediately became extremely worried. Even that Chu Xuanlang revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>No matter what, Wang Qiang was only injured by the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan. They felt that the Golden Crane True Immortal would definitely be able to treat him. After all, the Golden Crane True Immortal was someone with status in the Upper Realms.</p><p>Yet now, the Golden Crane True Immortal had actually declared that the situation was bad. How could Chu Feng and the others not be surprised by this?</p><p>&#x201C;The reason why Wang Qiang&#x2019;s injury has been unable to heal is mainly because of that poison,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;That poison?&#x201D; Chu Feng and the others had all diagnosed Wang Qiang&#x2019;s injury before. Thus, they all knew that Wang Qiang had been poisoned.</p><p>&#x201C;That poison is so powerful that even senior is unable to cure it?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;One will naturally need an antidote to cure poison. As for this poison&#x2019;s antidote, I do not possess it,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Even senior does not possess the antidote to this poison? There&#x2019;s actually such a powerful poison in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&#x201D; Chu Xuanlang asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It is naturally not a poison from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Not a poison from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm? Then, it&#x2019;s a poison from the Upper Realms?&#x201D; Chu Xuanlang asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I have seen this poison before. It is rare even in the Upper Realms. Thus, its antidote is very hard to obtain.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although it is not a very strong poison, it is very hard to bring it under control.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, all I can do is stabilize Wang Qiang&#x2019;s condition so that he will not be in fatal danger. However, if you all want to cure his poison, you will have to obtain that antidote,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, where must we go to obtain this antidote?&#x201D; Zhao Hong hurriedly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Where you go to find the antidote is your business,&#x201D; As the Golden Crane True Immortal spoke, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Although I&#x2019;ve promised you that I will treat Wang Qiang, I will not go and help you find the antidote.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The reason for that is because it is very possible that one must fight to obtain the antidote. And I&#x2026; do not plan to involve myself in the struggles of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s intention was clear. He was willing to treat Wang Qiang&#x2019;s injury, but would not help Chu Feng and the others settle their grudges in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>This was a question of principle.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior&#x2019;s agreement to come treat Wang Qiang is already a great kindness to us. This Chu Feng will not make excessive requests,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That said, you can rest assured. Before you all obtain the antidote, I will ensure the safety of this Wang Qiang,&#x201D; After the Golden Crane True Immortal finished saying those words, he looked to Chu Xuanlang and said, &#x201C;It would be safer for this Wang Qiang to stay at my place.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; Chu Xuanlang hurriedly agreed. He had realized the Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s intentions. That is, he planned to bring Wang Qiang into Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>Although the Golden Crane True Immortal would not involve himself in the grievances and grudges Chu Feng and the others had with the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, for Wang Qiang to be with him, he would definitely be safe.</p><p>After all, no matter how powerful the various powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm might be, not a single one of them were willing to provoke the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng and Zhao Hong both expressed their thanks.</p><p>They felt that it was already very rare for someone neutral like the Golden Crane True Immortal to be willing to go this far for them.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s decided then. After you&#x2019;ve obtained the antidote, come find me at Mount Cloud Crane. As for Wang Qiang, I&#x2019;ll bring him away for now,&#x201D; As the Golden Crane True Immortal spoke, he disappeared.</p><p>Right after he disappeared, he immediately reappeared. When he reappeared, there was one extra individual next to him. As for that person, he was none other than Wang Qiang.</p><p>Wang Qiang was still unconscious. However, when compared to before, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s aura was much better.</p><p>Apart from his complexion still being a bit pale, he only resembled someone who had fallen asleep. One could not tell that he had been injured and poisoned.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that even though the Golden Crane True Immortal was unable to completely cure Wang Qiang, he had indeed managed to stabilize Wang Qiang&#x2019;s condition and save his life.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the Golden Crane True Immortal spread open his palm. Then, light started to shine from his palm. It was a medicinal pellet.</p><p>This medicinal pellet was a bit special. It was sparkling and translucent, like a bead of crystal. However, in the center of this bead was the image of a blade of grass.</p><p>Even though it was clearly formed by the Golden Crane True Immortal with his world spirit techniques, that medicinal pellet not only possessed a life-like appearance, it also emitted an aura and fragrance. It was as if that medicinal pellet was real.</p><p>At that moment, even Chu Feng and Zhao Hong revealed expressions of admiration.</p><p>They realized that there was no end to learning on the path of world spirit techniques.</p><p>&#x201C;If the antidote is finished, it should resemble this. If it is a medicinal herb, then it should resemble the herb in the medicinal pellet. Remember this, do not be deceived,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng and Zhao Hong said in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, I will wait for you all at Mount Cloud Crane.&#x201D;</p><p>After the Golden Crane True Immortal finished saying those words, he started to float off into the distance. Soon, he disappeared into the vast white clouds.</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal was flying while bringing Wang Qiang with him. They were currently flying toward Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>He looked at the sleeping Wang Qiang and moved his palm to the Cosmos Sack on his waist. A flash of light emerged as a medicinal pellet appeared on his palm.</p><p>That medicinal pellet was actually exactly the same as the medicinal pellet he had formed through world spirit techniques earlier. Merely, it was real now.</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal fed Wang Qiang the medicinal pellet and helped him swallow it.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s mouth opened as a layer of deep green stinky gas emerged from his mouth.</p><p>The next moment, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s pale complexion turned rosy.</p><p>Although Wang Qiang was still sleeping, the poison on his body had been completely removed.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t understand. Since you have the antidote, why must you deceive Chu Feng and the others and demand that they seek the antidote themselves?&#x201D;</p><p>A figure appeared. He was none other than the plain-clothed old monk.</p><p>He had been hidden the entire time. Although Chu Feng and the others had not discovered him, he had witnessed all that had happened.</p><p>&#x201C;This poison is something that the Kong Heavenly Clan should not possess. As for where it came from&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I feel like there are some answers that I need Chu Feng and the others to find,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. Merely, there are already people from the Upper Realms involving themselves in this Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&#x2019;s mess. Furthermore, they are targeting Chu Feng and the others. The path that Chu Feng and the others have to follow will be hard to walk,&#x201D; The plain-clothed old monk said.</p><p>&#x201C;The path to become an expert has never been an easy path. If you&#x2019;re afraid that something will happen to them, you can act to help them. In that case, all of the crises here will be solved,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; The plain-clothed old monk chuckled. Then, he entered the void. No one knew what exactly that chuckle meant.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
