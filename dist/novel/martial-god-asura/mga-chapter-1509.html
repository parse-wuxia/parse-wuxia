<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1509 - A Rude Request</strong></p><p>&#x201C;The Cyanwood Mountain is indeed no match for the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. However, in this Cyanwood Domain, the Cyanwood Mountain is the ruler. It is a power that not even you, Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, that live here dare to provoke,&#x201D; Chu Feng continued.</p><p>Xian Kun pointed to the symbol on his chest and loudly shouted, &#x201C;You are truly arrogant. I might as well tell you this. I am not an Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf from this place. I, your father, am from the Elf Kingdom! Look carefully at this, what the fuck do you think this is?! Do you recognize this symbol?!&#x201D;</p><p>It was as if he were afraid that others would not know that he was an Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf from the Elf Kingdom.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, so you&#x2019;re actually from the Elf Kingdom. It&#x2019;s no wonder you&#x2019;re this arrogant. However, I wish to ask you this. Since you&#x2019;re from the Elf Kingdom, instead of staying in the Elf Kingdom, why did you run all the way over here? Could it be that you&#x2019;ve made some sort of mistake and have been kicked out of the Elf Kingdom?&#x201D; Chu Feng sneered.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Xian Kun&#x2019;s complexion instantly turned green from anger. He nearly lost breath and died of anger.</p><p>That was because what Chu Feng said was correct. With a single sentence, Chu Feng had jabbed him right at his sore spot. Indeed, he had been driven out of the Elf Kingdom.</p><p>Back then, after Xian Kun successfully triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle in the Elf Kingdom, he obtained unbounded glory. He was declared a genius, and followed the Elf Princess everywhere to search for the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flower.</p><p>Back then, when he had arrived at the Cyanwood Domain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond, even the Southern Elf Lord in charge of this region had treated him with the utmost respect. In fact, he had even asked him to trigger their Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle.</p><p>However, to Xian Kun&#x2019;s dismay, he had failed. Not only did he not successfully trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle, it was instead triggered by a human.</p><p>This came as an utter disgrace to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. After news of this matter was spread to the Elf Kingdom, out of anger, the Elf Kingdom kicked Xian Kun out, and made it so that he could only stay in the Cyanwood Domain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond for the rest of his life, unable to return to the Elf Kingdom ever again.</p><p>Afterwards, Xian Kun came to find out that the person who had triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle had entered the Cyanwood Mountain. This was why he disliked the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain this much.</p><p>However, if he were to find out that the person who had actually triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle, who had made him get kicked out of the Elf Kingdom and ruined his future prospects was actually Chu Feng who was standing right before him, who knows what sort of wonderful expressions he might make and thoughts he might have. Likely, he might even have the intention to kill Chu Feng on the spot.</p><p>&#x201C;Two sirs, please give me some face and stop fighting, no?&#x201D; Right at this moment, Yan Lei spoke. As the person holding the gathering, he naturally did not wish for Chu Feng and Xian Kun to fight.</p><p>Furthermore, he felt that if the two of them were to fight, Chu Feng would be absolutely no match for Xian Kun at all. Thus, he stood before Chu Feng when he spoke those words. His intention was clear; he was trying to say that he would protect Chu Feng and wanted Xian Kun to exercise restraint.</p><p>At this moment, Xian Kun was enormously enraged. However, due to the fact that this was the Yan Clan, he had no choice but to give Yan Lei face. As such, he waved his sleeve and returned to the direction that he had come from.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, before Xian Kun came here, he had asked me if I had invited the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain. I had told him that I did not know any of the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s disciples and did not invite any.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I do not have any intention of looking down on the Cyanwood Mountain. Thus, Brother Chu Feng, you must, by all means, not take offense from this,&#x201D; Yan Lei feared that Chu Feng would bear a grudge, and so began to explain to him why he had not invited the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s alright, I understand,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled. He was able to tell that Yan Lei did not bear any malice toward him. In fact, the majority of the people present did not bear any malice toward him.</p><p>At this moment, only four people present bore malice toward him. They were the three Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves led by Xian Kun, and the self-declared soon-to-be royal-cloak world spiritist Tian Liang.</p><p>Of the twenty people present, only four people thought Chu Feng to be a thorn.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng is truly a highly principled person. Since you&#x2019;ve already come, let&#x2019;s enjoy ourselves. First, allow me to introduce you to my friends,&#x201D; Yan Lei smiled and then began to lead Chu Feng toward the crowd.</p><p>When Chu Feng approached, before Yan Lei could introduce them, those people walked toward Chu Feng of their own accord and began to greet him.</p><p>All of them possessed powerful cultivations. The majority of them were between rank six Martial Kings and rank eight Martial Kings; they were all stronger than Tian Liang.</p><p>However, all of them were very good-natured toward Chu Feng. Not only were they not conceited, they instead had some reverence for Chu Feng. There were two reasons as to why they acted in this sort of manner.</p><p>Firstly, Chu Feng was the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s disciple. Furthermore, Dugu Xingfeng was also present in the Yan Clan. Thus, they were afraid of Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts.</p><p>Secondly, Chu Feng&#x2019;s own strength was not weak. He possessed sufficient qualifications for them to respect him.</p><p>While this was known to be a gathering, it was actually merely a chat, a discussion among people of the same generation.</p><p>Some people knew that the Nine Powers Hunt had just ended. Thus, they had come to inquire of Chu Feng as to which power&#x2019;s disciple had obtained first place in the Nine Powers Hunt.</p><p>Furthermore, some others knew that the Ten Thousand Flowers Garden&#x2019;s Nie sisters were very powerful, and asked Chu Feng if they had obtained first place in this year&#x2019;s Nine Powers Hunt.</p><p>Faced with these sorts of question, Chu Feng began to avert them as if he were practicing Taiji.</p><p>[1. Taiji&#x2192; Tai Chi in the west. The way they fight is basically to avert your opponent&#x2019;s attack and then have them hit themselves. Using soft to fight against hard and slow to fight against fast.]</p><p>It was not that Chu Feng did not wish to answer them. Merely, he found it embarrassing to tell them that he was the one who had obtained first place in the Nine Powers Hunt. If he were to do so, it would truly be boasting about his own accomplishments, blowing his own trumpet. Chu Feng was not Tian Liang; he was not someone fond of boasting or showing himself off to be extremely amazing. That was the reason why he did not want to answer their questions.</p><p>If the individual who obtained first place in the Nine Powers Hunt wasn&#x2019;t him, Chu Feng would have told the crowd without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>However, on the whole, Chu Feng got along well with the crowd. Furthermore, due to the fact that the crowd was fond of chatting with Chu Feng, the three Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves ended up being isolated.</p><p>After being silent for a long time, Xian Kun said to Yan Lei, &#x201C;Brother Yan, I&#x2019;ve heard that your Yan Clan has a special technique by the name of Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That technique greatly surpasses ordinary Earthen Taboo Martial Skills. If used, it could turn a region into a boundless sea of flames, and is capable of even burning up the waters in the sea. Back then, Lord Flame Master used precisely that technique leaving behind the Purgatory Sea of Flames, that forbidden area. However, that martial skill is something that I&#x2019;ve only heard about and never seen before. Might Brother Yan be able to show me that martial skill?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What Lord Flame Emperor used back then was not the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique. Instead, it was a different martial skill by the name of Earthen Taboo: Burning Heaven Technique.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That Earthen Taboo: Burning Heaven Technique is comparable to Heaven Taboo Martial Skills. It is extremely powerful. However, due to the fact that it&#x2019;s very difficult to learn, and one could set oneself on fire and dig one&#x2019;s own grave if one isn&#x2019;t careful while learning it, this Earthen Taboo: Burning Heaven Technique is also a taboo in our Yan Clan. Unless one becomes a Martial Emperor, no one is qualified to train in it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While I have not learned that Earthen Taboo: Burning Heaven Technique, I have learned the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique that Brother Xian Kun spoke of. If brother Xian Kun wishes to see it, I am able to display it to you,&#x201D; Yan Lei said.</p><p>&#x201C;Great. In that case, we shall trouble Brother Yan Lei,&#x201D; Hearing those words, the crowd all began to applaud.</p><p>The Yan Clan had been hidden away for a very long time, and had not fought against others. Thus, their methods were things that very few people had seen before. Today, Yan Lei was willing to display his skill. Naturally, the crowd would be filled with anticipation.</p><p>Yan Lei did not hesitate. He soared into the sky and stopped in midair. As his clothes fluttered, he was about to display the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique.</p><p>However, right at this moment, Xian Kun spoke. &#x201C;Wait a moment.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Xian Kun, is there something else you need?&#x201D; Yan Lei asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I think Brother Yan Lei has mistaken my intention. By seeing, I do not mean to see you display the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique. Instead, I wish to personally see the cultivation method for the Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique,&#x201D; Xian Kun said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say?&#x201D; Once Xian Kun&#x2019;s words left his mouth, the expressions of Yan Lei and Yan Ru took a huge change. Deep anger filled their faces.</p><p>Xian Kun had purposely made an extremely rude request.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>Below are Bee&#x2019;s afterwords for this chapter. I felt like translating this...</p><p>Ps; There are some readers that asked me if I will stop updating should I stop receiving flowers. My answer to them is &#x2018;definitely not.&#x2019; Even if no one was to send me flowers, I will still continue updating because this is my work.</p><p>Merely, if the reader&#x2019;s support is insufficient, I will definitely not put forth as much effort in updating as I am now. Instead, I will choose to strike a balance between work and rest. I will choose to update at the appropriate time and rest at the appropriate time.</p><p>Writing a book is a very tiring work. To write for an entire day is akin to carrying bricks for an entire day. However, carrying around bricks would strengthen one&#x2019;s body. Yet, one must always sit in front of a computer to write and will not be able to exercise. Thus, writing is detrimental to one&#x2019;s health.</p><p>That is the reason why many writers have illnesses, why their bodies are all weak and bad. In fact, many writers died from overwork. I am not playing around. There are many news online regarding that. If everyone doesn&#x2019;t believe me, you can go and search about them. [2. Yes, this happens. Especially in asian countries with businessmen. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar%C5%8Dshi I should consider working less or getting a better schedule to get a better work-life balance myself :/]</p><p>The reason why I am working so hard is not because I do not want to live. Rather, the power that everyone had given me made me feel not that tired. When my heart doesn&#x2019;t feel tired, my body naturally also stopped feeling tired. If one&#x2019;s heart is strong, one&#x2019;s body will become strong too. This is the power of spirit.</p><p>None of this is mysterious, they are all supported by science. It&#x2019;s just like when someone&#x2019;s ill but has a good mental state and maintains an optimistic mindset will be able to defeat the illness. However, if the person that&#x2019;s ill does not have a good mental state, they will die extremely fast.</p><p>Everyone&#x2019;s support is the encouragement to my spirit. They are what allows my mental state to be very good, allows me to have sufficient energy and fighting strength.</p><p>I hope that everyone understands what I meant by that. Your support is truly the greatest power. I am not joking. Lastly, I will like to thank you all for your support.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
