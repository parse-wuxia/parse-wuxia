<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 941 - Choosing the Sect Head</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, be calm! Revenge must be exacted, but before that, we must still decide on a sect head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure everyone must feel that I, Xue Xiyue, and Fu Liansheng are the most fitting to lead the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Actually, from the start, our thoughts were the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, we&#x2019;re old. Even if one of us does become sect head, how many years could we last for?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, after careful discussion, we decided to abandon this position and instead choose to develop a substitute sect head from an entirely new generation,&#x201D; You Mingdeng said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Choose a substitute sect head?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But other than the Three Protectors, who else is qualified to hold this position?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Five Elemental Kings? No, that&#x2019;s not right. They too are not young, so if the Three Protectors aren&#x2019;t going to strive for that position, then they wouldn&#x2019;t either!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">You Mingdeng&#x2019;s words made the crowd very shocked. They started discussing amongst themselves, and some people even started panicking. They felt the Three Protectors were the most suitable, but if they refused this position, then there would be no one else who would be suitable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. Let me see what sort of tricks you are playing.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng on the other hand was very calm. He had already understood You Mingdeng&#x2019;s nature. He was not a person who&#x2019;d give up power so easily. If Chu Feng was not mistaken, You Mingdeng would think of a way to seize the authority of sect head into his hands. His words regarding a substitute sect head had already stated his intentions as clear as day.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The substitute sect head must be a young person, one that has both ability and potential.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of all the people in the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s younger generation, Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming are the most suitable nominees. So, I first suggest them three.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, regarding this decision, we must make it absolutely fair: as long as it is a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s younger generation, anyone can participate in this.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As for the method of selection, it&#x2019;s very simple. The Demon Sealing Sword is the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s most valuable treasure. When Sect Head was alive, he had left a few words behind: no matter who it is, as long as they are able to pull out the Demon Sealing Sword, they could inherit his position and become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. The members must all listen to that person&#x2019;s orders as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, the Demon Sealing Sword is too powerful. Other than Lord Sect head, there is simply no one who is qualified to grasp it. Even us three, and Big Brother Qiu Canfeng as well, were unable to pull it out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, the Crippling Night Demon Sect is facing an unprecedented danger. We must quickly select a sect head, so we have no choice but to alter Lord Sect Head&#x2019;s wishes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We will borrow the power of the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation and lay a new formation. There are ten layers in total, and the closer one approaches the Demon Sealing Sword, the greater the pressure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Within the formation, whoever advances the most will become the substitute sect head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. That person will be developed by me, Xue Xiyue, and Fu Liansheng until he becomes a true sect head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, the sect head selection will officially begin. Any person in the younger generation can attempt this formation.&#x201D; You Mingdeng shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">A bit of ruckus arose immediately after he spoke. Xuan Xiaochao and the others were the publicly acclaimed geniuses of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. If a substitute sect head were to be chosen from the younger generation, then only the three of them were the most qualified.</span></p><p><span style="">Besides, putting aside personal strength, they even had the backup of the Three Protectors. There was truly no one who was worthy to contest against them.</span></p><p><span style="">As a result, those who knew their limits didn&#x2019;t stand out to challenge the position. However, there were always exceptions. Though most people were logical, there would always exist some fearless people, or perhaps some strong people. People like them were always brimming with confidence, and they would never submit to others.</span></p><p><span style="">In fact, after a few brief moments of dead silence, there were a few young people who came out.</span></p><p><span style="">They were all Martial Lords, and their cultivations were not weak either: the lowest was a rank three Martial Lord. Including You Tonghan and the others, there was a total of eighteen people who prepared to run for sect head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not bad. Applaudable courage. Our Crippling Night Demon Sect needs exactly brave youths as yourselves.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">On the surface, You Mingdeng appeared very happy towards the young people who were with his own disciple, but from his smile and squinting eyes, Chu Feng saw one word: overestimation. From the bottom of his heart, You Mingdeng looked down on those people who came forth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lord Protectors, Seniors, this untalented Zhao Hu will go first.&#x201D; A brawny young man clasped his fists at the Three Protectors and their disciples. Then, he went straight for the formation.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* His steps were stable, and he was quite robust. However, in the instant he stepped into the tenth layer, his expression changed greatly as an enormous pressure fell upon him.</span></p><p><span style="">But he did not give up just like that. Gritting his teeth with widened eyes, he advanced forward one step at a time.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom*</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, he slipped and let out a cry. Blood sprayed straight out of his mouth, and simultaneously he lost control of his body. He shot out from the formation and flew out.</span></p><p><span style="">He was whizzing through the air so fast if he were to collide into something, he would receive a heavy injury.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">You Mingdeng seemed to have expected that. He waved his big sleeve, and a gentle breeze flew over, slowing the male and landing him down safely, thus avoiding any serious injuries.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, Lord Protector, for saving me. This untalented Zhao Hu is unable to pass even one layer,&#x201D; he shamefully said as he wiped the traces of blood on the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No matter. This formation is very powerful. Being able to successfully enter already means you have great aptitude. Work hard and you will have extraordinary results,&#x201D; You Mingdeng consoled with a smile. He spread open his palm, and a healing pellet flew into Zhao Hu&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, Lord Protector.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Zhao Hu received the pellet and thanked with a bow and a clasp of his hands. Before the gazes of the crowd, he returned.</span></p><p><span style="">After Zhao Hu, others continuously stepped into the formation. However, most of them were like Zhao Hu. They could not even safely pass through the tenth layer, and the one with the best result could only reach the eighth layer but was still unable to enter the seventh.</span></p><p><span style="">One after the other, outstanding youths were shot out by the power of the formation. When the observing crowd saw that, they finally knew of the formation&#x2019;s strength, and also of the Demon Sealing Sword&#x2019;s power.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, everyone left with failures, leaving behind only Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they were looking at each other as they wore complicated emotions on their faces. It seemed as if they didn&#x2019;t want to take even a single step. They didn&#x2019;t want to fight over this position of sect head.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
