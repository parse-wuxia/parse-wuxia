<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 927 - The Father of the Holy Daughter</strong></p><p><span style="">Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s words were not spoken in private via mental messages. So, nearly everyone within the palace heard them crisp and clear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This Jiang Qisha is too terrifying. At such a young age, his thought progress is already so elaborate. I&#x2019;ve never had a feeling of safety in his hands. Instead, I feel even more dangerous,&#x201D; Su Mei said a bit worriedly as she sent mental messages.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He is indeed not a good person at all, but at least temporarily, we are safe in his hands. If Murong Mingtian truly brought us away, Murong Xun wouldn&#x2019;t have let us go,&#x201D; Su Rou replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I heard that you&#x2019;ve got a Divine Body?&#x201D; Just at that moment, Jiang Qisha cast his gaze towards Zi Ling. Moreover, with a light smile, he walked towards her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh. Divine Body? It&#x2019;s the first time that I&#x2019;ve seen such a weak Divine Body. She&#x2019;s even less than trash.&#x201D; Zhao Yuetian also walked over and he looked at Zi Ling with a face full of disdain.</span></p><p><span style="">However, after he carefully examining Zi Ling&#x2019;s countenance, he curled his lips vilely. He said with an odd smile, &#x201C;Although her cultivation&#x2019;s a bit weak, she doesn&#x2019;t look too bad. This face is truly the most beautiful I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, Zhao Yuetian looked at Jiang Qisha, then said, &#x201C;Senior, how about you take this girl? Although she&#x2019;s very weak, with that face alone, you can invoke quite a few people&#x2019;s admiration if you bring her back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Zhao, Senior Jiang is not someone who greeds over beauty. If you ask me, </span><i><span style="">you</span></i><span style=""> want to take this Zi Ling back, right?&#x201D; Wu Kunlun walked over, then said to Jiang Qisha, &#x201C;Senior, I&#x2019;ve asked around, and she is indeed a Divine Body. When she was born, the sight she triggered had caused quite the scene. Many people had personally witnessed it, so the fact that she&#x2019;s a Divine Body should be true.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, I just don&#x2019;t know why her aptitude in cultivation is this weak. She&#x2019;s the weakest out of all these people.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The exact reason why can be known through an examination.&#x201D; As Jiang Qisha spoke, she willed a door to open in the Spirit Formation cage that locked Zi Ling and the others. He then strode in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing? Stay away from my Sister Zi Ling!&#x201D; Su Rou and Su Mei leapt forth, wanting to stop Jiang Qisha.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was such a huge distance in cultivation between these two groups. How could the two of them possibly stop him? In the instant they started moving they were enveloped by Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s aura, and were completely frozen. At the same time, Jiang Qisha had grabbed Zi Ling&#x2019;s wrist as he began seriously observing her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha, the heavens are helping me, the heavens are helping me! Murong Mingtian, you old fox, you&#x2019;re quite vicious! But sadly, your preparations have been a gift for myself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Jiang Qisha let go after a brief moment. On his face, an elated smile emerged. He started loudly laughing, and could not calm himself for quite a while.</span></p><p><span style="">Zhao Yuetian and Wu Kunlun felt confused at such an outburst. However, they definitely knew it was something good. So, they asked at the same time, &#x201C;Senior Jiang, what did you discover?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, I cannot leak a divine secret, but in short, this girl is mine.&#x201D; Jiang Qisha looked once again at Zi Ling. It didn&#x2019;t seem as if he was looking at a beauty, but instead, at a treasure.</span></p><p><span style="">Zi Ling and the others tightly knitted their brows. They knew why he said that. He must have discovered the secret of the Heaven Gripping Pellet, and wanted to take Zi Ling&#x2019;s power for himself.</span></p><p><span style="">Time flew past, and after a blink, several days had elapsed.</span></p><p><span style="">Within a certain forest in the Eastern Sea Region, there was a worn out little temple. Inside were Chu Feng, Qiushui Fuyan, and Lady Piaomiao.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng and Qiushui Fuyan were in quite a decent state, but worry was worn all over their faces. They looked with extreme anxiousness at Lady Piaomiao who lay on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">Ever since Lady Piaomiao lost consciousness, she had yet to awaken. Moreover, her aura kept on sliding downward. She, initially a rank six Martial King, had now become a rank five Martial King. Her cultivation was shrinking.</span></p><p><span style="">Not to mention Chu Feng, even Qiushui Fuyan could do nothing about that. They were out of ideas.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sister Fuyan, if this continues, Senior Piaomiao&#x2019;s cultivation will keep dropping, and it&#x2019;s likely she won&#x2019;t be able to survive either. We cannot await her death at a place like this, and we should think of something,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with concern.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;She&#x2019;s used a technique she shouldn&#x2019;t have used, so we can&#x2019;t do anything about it. There is only one person who can save her. Looking at the time that has passed&#x2026; He should be arriving soon,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Someone&#x2019;s coming? Who?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked curiously.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You know this person,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I know him?&#x201D; Chu Feng was even more puzzled.</span></p><p><span style="">Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s expression abruptly changed slightly, then she rubbed the necklace on her neck and she said, &#x201C;Speak of the devil; he&#x2019;s here.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng quickly cast his gaze outside the little temple, and as expected, a person soon appeared and quickly flew in.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Taikou?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, after seeing that person, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed greatly. His eyes were full of surprise, because Chu Feng truly did know that old man. He not only knew him, this person had helped him many times before. He was the powerful and famous person in the Four Seas Academy, Taikou, whose origin was mysterious and whose cultivation was unfathomably deep.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuyan, how&#x2019;s your mother&#x2019;s condition?&#x201D; Taikou&#x2019;s face was one of anxiety after he entered. He didn&#x2019;t greet Chu Feng as he directly asked Qiushui Fuyan a question.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Mother?&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was shocked. That word truly frightened him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go in yourself and take a look.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan did not reply, and instead cast her gaze at Lady Piaomiao.</span></p><p><span style="">Taikou didn&#x2019;t bother with any more questions. He leapt forward and immediately appeared in front of Lady Piaomiao. He sat on the ground cross-legged, and observed Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s present state.</span></p><p><span style="">After a while, Taikou took out several medicinal pellets with special properties and put them in Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s mouth. After helping her refine them, he looked back at Qiushui Fuyan and Chu Feng, and said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. Although she used a forbidden technique, causing serious damage to her body, at least her life is not at peril.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, he didn&#x2019;t pay any more attention to them. He directly used a Mysterious Technique, laid a formation, and started healing Lady Piaomiao with special methods.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s go. Don&#x2019;t disturb him.&#x201D; As Qiushui Fuyan spoke, she walked out the little temple. After glimpsing at Taikou and Lady Piaomiao, Chu Feng followed her out because he knew Qiushui Fuyan had something she wanted to say to him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve made a guess or two, right?&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan asked with a smile after coming to a peaceful corner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng was a bit hesitant, and ultimately, did not respond.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You are correct, Lady Piaomiao is my mother, and Taikou is my father,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said with a bit of sorrow.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng sucked in a deep breath of air. Although he had guessed it already, Chu Feng still felt very shocked when he confirmed it from Qiushui Fuyan herself. In an instant, the emotions in his heart surged and he could not remain calm.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
