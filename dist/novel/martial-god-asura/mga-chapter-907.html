<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 907 - Forced to Ask for Assistance</strong></p><p><span style="">Tens of millions of monsters with strength of peak Martial Lords stood straight in the air. That number was the exact same as the number of people in the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans; however, their strength in total was more uniform and powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, every single one of them seemed as if they had true life. No matter appearance or their inside, it did not seem like they were made by a formation. It truly appeared as if they were living beings that had their own intelligence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In this world, there&#x2019;s a formation like this? It&#x2019;s able to create such lifelike entities&#x2026;&#x201D; Even Chu Feng, who was very skilled in Spirit Formations, frowned. He didn&#x2019;t expect Jiang Qisha to be able to create such a masterful formation.</span></p><p><span style="">Although Jiang Qisha had used the power of tens of millions, it was truly quite horrifying for him to summon tens of millions of powerful monsters with cultivation of peak Martial Lords.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh, I&#x2019;ve finally seen a technique from the Holy Land of Martialism. However, you underestimate me too much if you want to break through my formation with merely this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The corner of Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s mouth curled up slightly, then her eyes lit up as the golden swords of the Immortal Sword Formation, as if they received an order, stopped spinning around the peak and instead, pointed their tips in all directions. They looked as if they would massacre any invaders.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Jiang Qisha disdainfully smiled at the change occurring to the Immortal Sword Formation. He pointed his hand at the Misty Peak, then shouted, &#x201C;Kill&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*aoo&#x2014;* After his words, the tens of millions of monsters pounded their chests and stamped their feet as they let out a world-shaking roar. Like inverted meteors, they densely flew straight towards the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, many people within the Misty Peak were terrified. Other than Lady Piaomiao, Chu Feng, and the others, a large portion of people backed away in fright. They were afraid the monsters would break through the formation and instantly kill them.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh* However, the Immortal Sword Formation was obviously not something useless. When the army of monsters reached a certain range, the countless huge golden swords shot towards them with light-like speed and a might that could crush anything.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom boom boom boom*</span></p><p><span style="">Explosions rang out, and shock waves were endlessly created. It didn&#x2019;t matter how powerful the monsters were; they were unable to withstand the attacks from the huge golden swords. As long as they were struck, they would shatter immediately. There was no chance for them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the monsters were not simple either. As long as they weren&#x2019;t struck by the golden sword, it didn&#x2019;t matter how horrifying the shock waves were. None would harm them, and like unstoppable arrows, they shot straight past the golden swords, into the defensive formation.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom, boom, boom, boom&#x2026;*</span></p><p><span style="">Although the golden swords were powerful, their numbers were limited. Moreover, the monsters were very quick, and they also had intelligence, leading to their guile.</span></p><p><span style="">So, the golden swords simply could not destroy them all. The monsters started to unendingly pass through the Immortal Sword Formation, and after doing so, they did not blindly advance. Instead, with some sort of self-destruction technique, they diminished the power of the defensive formation.</span></p><p><span style="">Although their cultivations were only of peak Martial Lords, their self-destruction power was very terrifying, to the point every time they blew up, the entire defensive formation slightly trembled. That strength was even comparable to the strongest attack from a Martial King.</span></p><p><span style="">And with the increasing number of monsters that passed through the defensive line of the Immortal Sword Formation, the trembles began increasing in frequency. The entire defensive formation was in a very perilous spot.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;He does possess a bit of skill&#x2014;he knows he cannot destroy the Immortal Sword Formation, so he directly attacks the defensive formation. It seems that I&#x2019;ve underestimated him.&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao knitted her brows. She knew that person was no simple character.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Piaomiao, there are special talismans on those monsters, and the reason their self-destruction strength is so powerful is due to the talismans.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Although the strongest attack from a Martial King cannot threaten this formation, since there are so many attacks unendingly occurring, the power of this defensive formation doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore! It can&#x2019;t completely resist their attacks,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said worriedly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fuyan, you&#x2019;re right. Their formation is very powerful and it has truly surpassed my imagination. I won&#x2019;t be able to hold them off if this continues. We can now only plan for the worst.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, bring Chu Feng to the Altar of Exorcism. Try to make contact with the mysterious existence in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. See if it&#x2019;s willing to help us escape this disaster for Chu Feng&#x2019;s sake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If it&#x2019;s willing to, then even the people from the Holy Land of Martialism will die here today. If not, then we can only leave,&#x201D; Lady Piaomiao said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, as the guardian of this place, wouldn&#x2019;t it be better for you to go?&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan expressed confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If I could have, then I would have already. In the eyes of outsiders, I am the guardian of the Misty Peak and they feel that I&#x2019;ve gotten great things from this place.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, I myself know very well that the so-called guardian of the Misty Peak is merely a watchdog that cleans up trash for that mysterious existence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It does not care who guards this place as long as there </span><i><span style="">is</span></i><span style=""> a guard. However, Chu Feng is different. Chu Feng seems to have received its approval, so perhaps he can come into contact with it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Bring Chu Feng there. As long as the mysterious existence helps us, that will be good. However, don&#x2019;t stay there for too long. If there&#x2019;s a response, then great. If not, then don&#x2019;t force it and quickly return.&#x201D; As she spoke, Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s tone was rather helpless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan didn&#x2019;t continue asking. She turned around, grabbed Chu Feng, and flew deep into the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh* Just when Qiushui Fuyan brought Chu Feng away, the army of the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans once again channeled their power into the runic door.</span></p><p><span style="">With another activation from Jiang Qisha, the door once again shone with brilliance. Millions upon millions of horrifying monsters appeared again. They were the exact same as the ones before, and they started to continuously advance towards the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, everyone from the Misty Peak were terrified. They could tell if that continued, the defensive formation would be destroyed&#x2014;destroyed when their enemy hadn&#x2019;t even spent a single soldier. This time, they had truly entered a horrendous situation.</span></p><p><span style="">In reality, it was not only Xia Yu, Dong Xue, and the others who thought that. Even the guardian of the Misty Peak, Lady Piaomiao, frowned. However, she could do nothing. She could only use everything she had to hold up the defensive formation.</span></p><p><span style="">As she did so, she hoped Chu Feng could make contact with the mysterious existence in this place and borrow its power. If he were able to, then it could eradicated everyone outside the Misty Peak.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
