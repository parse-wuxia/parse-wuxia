<p><strong> Chapter 2468 - Forced Learning</strong></p><p>Zhan Yuanmo knelt before the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe and spoke loudly, &#x201C;We, clansmen of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan, are willing to listen and obey Lord War Axe&#x2019;s orders.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We are willing to listen and obey Lord War Axe&#x2019;s orders.&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately after, the others of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan also knelt before the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, they were ungrateful toward you and returned your kindness with malice. Are you truly not planning to look further into this?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe asked Chu Feng.</p><p>Sure enough, it had come out of Zhan Yuanmo for the sake of upholding justice for Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Although they imprisoned me, they did not cause me harm. As such, it could be considered that they have taken our friendship into consideration.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword possesses a special significance to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan. I am able to understand their unwillingness for me to bring away the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I had never planned to do anything to them from the very start,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. You are truly a heroic young man. Although you are very young, you actually possess such a vast heart. Someone like you is truly rare to come by,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe praised Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen, listen up. While Chu Feng can refuse to look further into this, we cannot let this matter end like this. Else, we will truly become unrighteous and unjust.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We must compensate Chu Feng. I propose that we bring all of our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s signature martial skills for Chu Feng to train. That will serve as our compensation to him,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah? Bring our signature martial skills for Chu Feng to train in?! This!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were all astonished. One by one, they turned their gazes to Zhan Yuanmo.</p><p>After all, their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s martial skills were meant to only be taught to people of their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you not hear what Lord War Axe said? Why are you all still standing here? Go and bring all of our signature martial skills immediately,&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo said.</p><p>Seeing that even Zhan Yuanmo was in agreement, even though the others in the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan were unwilling, they still found it difficult to refuse. Thus, soon, a group of people left to retrieve their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s martial skills.</p><p>Soon, those people returned, carrying giant steles.</p><p>Those steles were very special. They were most definitely not made of ordinary stones, as they all emitted the sensation of being indestructible.</p><p>However, most important would be the countless characters that were engraved onto the steles in a densely packed manner.</p><p>None of those were ordinary characters. One could not comprehend them using common sense. However, if one were to turn one&#x2019;s gaze to them, the characters would emit a faint glimmer.</p><p>From a single glance, Chu Feng was able to tell that the steles were martial skills. Each stele represented a single martial skill.</p><p>At that moment, thirteen steeles were present. Among the thirteen, ten were Emperor Taboo Martial Skills, and the remaining three were Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills.</p><p>All of them were martial skills that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan would only teach their fellow clansmen.</p><p>Chu Feng did not bother to carefully examine the martial skills. However, he was able to tell with mere intuition that those martial skills were no small matter at all.</p><p>To put it briefly, those martial skills surpassed all of the martial skills that Chu Feng knew at the moment.</p><p>To be honest, Chu Feng was tempted. Faced with such powerful martial skills, how could Chu Feng not be tempted?</p><p>However, he was also able to tell that many of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were merely forced by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, and were not actually willing to hand those martial skills to him to learn.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, with such a good thing before you, you must not refuse it. If you dare to refuse it, this Queen will break off all relations with you,&#x201D; Seemingly able to guess what Chu Feng was thinking, Her Lady Queen hurriedly spoke to urge him.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng was truly placed in a difficult situation. As he had already profited enormously in the Martial Comprehension Ground, he truly did not wish to make things difficult for the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen and obtain benefits from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan again.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe suddenly emitted an oppressive might. That oppressive might descended abruptly and formed a tornado. From inside to outside, it began to expand.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuahh~~~:</p><p>The next moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were all knocked flying.</p><p>Soon, they were blown several meters away. Although they looked extremely sorry-looking as they were blown away, they all landed safe and sound without any injuries.</p><p>&#x201C;This is?!&#x201D; After landing, the crowd all revealed confused expressions.</p><p>They were surprised to discover that all of their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were blown out. However, Chu Feng was not affected by that tornado.</p><p>Chu Feng was still standing there. Furthermore, the thirteen martial skill steles had also been placed before Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe emitted a ray of golden light.</p><p>Like a fort, the golden light enveloped Chu Feng and the thirteen steles.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng spoke to ask, &#x201C;Senior War Axe, what are you intending to do?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I know that you&#x2019;re an affectionate and true individual. Thus, I was afraid that you would refuse. As such&#x2026; I am going to force you to learn them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will let you out the moment you master all of these martial skills. Otherwise... I will trap you here for the rest of your life,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah? Why&#x2026; why would Lord War Axe&#x2026; why would Lord War Axe act like this?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were all stunned.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha. Never would I have expected there to be such a good thing in this world. There&#x2019;s actually someone who will force an outsider to learn the martial skills that they do not teach outsiders.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Interesting. Chu Feng, this Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe is pretty decent. I am fond of its personality.&#x201D; At that moment, Her Lady Queen was clapping her hands.</p><p>&#x201C;This senior War Axe is indeed a bit too cordial,&#x201D; Chu Feng had a wry smile on his face.</p><p>Originally, he was faced with the difficult decision as to whether or not he should accept the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe&#x2019;s kind intentions and learn those martial skills.</p><p>However, there was now no need for him to be tangled up in that matter anymore, he simply had no ability to choose any longer.</p><p>At that moment, there was only a single path before Chu Feng. That is, he would have to master all of those Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s martial skills.</p><p>&#x201C;Now then, don&#x2019;t bother standing there. Go on and quickly learn them. Don&#x2019;t tell me you want to be trapped here for the rest of your life?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen urged.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, senior War Axe and the seniors of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan, this Chu Feng will accept your kind intentions.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng clasp his fist at the crowd. Then, he turned his gaze to the steles. Starting from the first one, he began to move his gaze over one after another. Once he started observing the steles, it lasted an entire hour. After that, Chu Feng sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes. No one knew what he was doing.</p><p>&#x201C;Never would I have expected Lord War Axe to force big brother Chu Feng to learn those martial skills.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With this being the case, I&#x2019;m afraid that big brother Chu Feng will likely be trapped in there for some time,&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong said with a sigh.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. With how extraordinarily talented benefactor is, even if those martial skills are difficult to grasp, he will definitely still be able to learn them very quickly,&#x201D; Zhan Lingling said.</p><p>Zhan Lingtong was still unable to stop himself from sighing.</p><p>He naturally knew that Chu Feng possessed extraordinary talent. However, those martial skills were truly difficult to learn.</p><p>For example, one of the Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills among the thirteen martial skills took his father ten entire years to learn the basics, and a hundred years to master.</p><p>Thus, he felt that regardless of how talented Chu Feng might be, it would still take him several years to completely master all those martial skills.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly opened his tightly closed eyes. Then, he stood up and said to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, &#x201C;Senior War Axe, you said that you&#x2019;ll let me out the moment I master these martial skills, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, senior, please validate this Chu Feng today,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Zhan Yuanmo.</p><p>&#x201C;Validate? Validate what?&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo asked in a confused manner.</p><p>&#x201C;It would naturally be as to whether or not the martial skills I&#x2019;ve learned meets the standard of mastery,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s naturally not an issue. Merely, Young Hero Chu Feng, you said that you want me to validate today? But, learning those martial skills will at least take&#x2026;&#x201D; Zhan Yuanmo wanted to say that he could validate them for Chu Feng, but today would likely not do. After all, he felt that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to master all of those martial skills that same day.</p><p>&#x201C;Zzzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, golden lightning emerged on Chu Feng&#x2019;s body.</p><p>The golden lightning were like serpents of lightning. As they revolved around Chu Feng, they formed a defensive barrier composed of golden lightnings.</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens, that&#x2026; that is!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the expressions of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clans&#x2019; men all changed enormously.</p><p>Even that Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe in the sky was startled.</p><p>The reason for that was because what Chu Feng had unleashed was one of their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Emperor Taboo Martial Skills by the name of Emperor Taboo: Golden Lightning Shield.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
