<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 951 - Two Pieces of Information</strong></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng soon arrived at the floating palace with Xuan Xiaochao and the others leading the way. Qiu Canfeng had personally built it, and it was an important area for war preparations. Even they didn&#x2019;t have the qualifications to enter.</span></p><p><span style="">But Chu Feng, as the sect head, could naturally enter any place since this was a part of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">After entering, Chu Feng discovered the Four Protectors&#x2014;Qiu Canfeng, Xue Xiyue, Fu Liansheng, and You Mingdeng&#x2014;were there.</span></p><p><span style="">Other than those four, there were also two more&#x2014;Qiushui Fuyan and Taikou.</span></p><p><span style="">However, there was an unfamiliar person Chu Feng hadn&#x2019;t seen before. It was an old man with a powerful aura&#x2014;rank four Martial King. However, he wore a sickly complexion. It was quite evident he was the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s First Immortal.</span></p><p><span style="">After seeing Chu Feng, his expression was very strange. His gaze especially was very strange, as if he knew Chu Feng already.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng even saw a hint of near indiscernible fear concealed within the First Immortal&#x2019;s gaze as he looked at Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">That made Chu Feng puzzled. He could not think of anything regarding himself that made a person like him feel fear.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, get out. I want to talk to Chu Feng alone,&#x201D; the First Immortal said after looking at Chu Feng carefully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That will not do. What if you intend to harm my sect head?&#x201D; But You Mingdeng denied him immediately after he spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sect head? He&#x2019;s already become sect head?&#x201D; The First Immortal felt quite surprised, but he still resolutely said, &#x201C;If you want to have a discussion, get out. Otherwise, there will be none.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Xue Xiyue was a bit displeased. She opened her mouth, about to spit out curses.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of you, leave,&#x201D; Chu Feng interrupted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, this&#x2026;&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan hurriedly cast a glance at Chu Feng, telling him to be more careful&#x2014;the First Immortal was very dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No matter. Seniors, head out for a moment. I feel that Senior First Immortal truly hopes to cooperate with us,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a faint smile. His face was completely calm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whatever. Since Sect Head has spoken, let&#x2019;s listen to him. We&#x2019;ll step outside,&#x201D; urged Qiu Canfeng as well when Chu Feng insisted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026; Then fine.&#x201D; You Mingdeng reluctantly nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, he was very dissatisfied with Chu Feng, and wanted Chu Feng dead no matter what. However, after Chu Feng became sect head, his attitude changed completely, and he became one of Chu Feng&#x2019;s most loyal subordinates. He was absolutely convinced by his aptitude.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First Immortal, if you dare to inflict harm upon my sect head, you will wish you were dead.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But even so, Xue Xiyue and the others did not forget to fiercely warn the First Immortal before leaving. Only then did they head out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior First Immortal, although we faced each other as enemies before, I still truly feel sorry for what happened to Ya Fei.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng clasped his hands towards the First Immortal after everyone left, representing his apology. He believed the First Immortal had seen Ya Fei already. Even though she was only a Consciousness, if she were still awake, she would still retain her memories. Perhaps she had already told the First Immortal that Murong Xun killed him. And likely also what Chu Feng did to her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No need for that. Everything was Murong Xun&#x2019;s fault. It&#x2019;s unrelated to you.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve come here today to ask you only one thing. If I help you deal with the Immortal Execution Archipelago, will you truly be able to help Fei&#x2019;er rebuild her body? Will you truly revive her?&#x201D; the First Immortal asked gravely. As he presented that question, he fixed his eyes closely on Chu Feng, his gaze filled with desire.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ya Fei&#x2019;s physical body has been destroyed. Her Source Energy has been cut, and I&#x2019;m afraid other people&#x2019;s bodies may not be compatible. Even if a body were created out of nowhere, it will still be very difficult to recombine her Consciousness with the new body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;From antiquity, there have been countless examples of destroyed bodies but surviving Consciousnesses. However, if it were that easy to recreate a physical body and thus revive, there would be no such thing as death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be honest: I cannot guarantee Ya Fei&#x2019;s resurrection. However, I will say that there are many profound techniques on the Misty Peak. Since Lady Piaomiao had spoken in such a manner, perhaps she truly does have a way to help Ya Fei,&#x201D; Chu Feng said truthfully.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2026; My poor Fei&#x2019;er!&#x201D; The First Immortal heaved a long sigh as the grief on his face became greater.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in the end, he still said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, I will help you. But I will only help you reach the stone tablet. Whether you&#x2019;ll be successful is your own business. I have nothing to do with that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, even though it was Murong Xun who killed Fei&#x2019;er, I will not kill him. Similarly, I will not kill a single person from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I can betray them, but I will not kill them.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, senior.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng rejoiced in his heart. Although the First Immortal held quite a position in the Immortal Execution Archipelago, from his words and actions, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t feel he was being lied to.</span></p><p><span style="">For Ya Fei, his precious granddaughter, he was truly preparing to help Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">After concluding, Chu Feng called in Qiu Canfeng and the others. They started to discuss the specifics regarding their plan to deal with the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Of course, when doing these things, the First Immortal was asked to leave with Taikou accompanying him.</span></p><p><span style="">The First Immortal had already promised to help them. However, Chu Feng could tell, regardless of the First Immortal&#x2019;s hatred towards the Immortal Execution Archipelago, he couldn&#x2019;t bear attacking them due to his own kindness.</span></p><p><span style="">So, when they started planning how to attack the Immortal Execution Archipelago, naturally it&#x2019;d be better to exclude him from the conversation. Otherwise, even if he could accept doing such things, there would be even greater guilty feelings in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, we&#x2019;ve heard two pieces of information when we were heading here. I feel that we must tell you this,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan suddenly said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sister Fuyan, what are they?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A few days ago, an abnormal scene occurred above the Eastern Sea Region&#x2019;s Fertile Continent. Its usual scalding summer atmosphere became a chilling air full of snow and ice.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, the snow and ice only stayed in the sky and didn&#x2019;t fall down. It stretched outward for several thousands of miles. There were even roars akin to wild beasts that came from the snow,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A phenomenon? Does that mean it&#x2019;s the descent of a Divine Body?&#x201D; Xue Xiyue asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure. But from what I&#x2019;ve heard, when a Divine Body appears, there will be indications. However, that scene suddenly appeared, then suddenly disappeared. No one knows what it meant.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, there&#x2019;s only been so many occurrences like this that have appeared in the Eastern Sea Region. I feel it&#x2019;s not normal for something to appear so suddenly,&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I agree, it&#x2019;s not normal at all. Sister Fuyan, what&#x2019;s the second news?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
