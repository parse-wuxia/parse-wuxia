<p><strong> Chapter 2453 - Sharp Weapon For Killing</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, run away immediately. Even if you are to rely on yourself, you must not resign yourself to fate. Isn&#x2019;t this simply throwing away your life?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Her Lady Queen was nearly driven mad with worry.</p><p>After all, with Chu Feng just standing there, the Death Sword would soon approach. With his actions, Chu Feng was simply waiting for death.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Sure enough, the Death Sword instantly arrived. It carried with it a dazzling golden light, as well as overwhelming killing intent, as it moved to pierce through Chu Feng&#x2019;s back.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when the Death Sword was about to piece into Chu Feng&#x2019;s back, Chu Feng suddenly shifted his body and dodged the sword.</p><p>&#x201C;You dodged it?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng had dodged the sword, a trace of joy appeared in Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s eyes that were filled with worry.</p><p>However, the very next moment, the joy in her eyes instantly disappeared.</p><p>The reason for that was because Her Lady Queen was surprised to discover that Chu Feng had actually extended his arm toward the Death Sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng grabbed the hilt of the Death Sword.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Her Lady Queen wanted to lash out at Chu Feng.</p><p>However, right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve actually managed to accomplish it.&#x201D;</p><p>It was the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword. This was the voice of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword.</p><p>Not only did Chu Feng come into contact with the Death Sword, but he had also grabbed it by the hilt. Yet, Chu Feng was actually not dead.</p><p>&#x201C;I get it now. So this is actually what it is. Chu Feng, you are simply too amazing to be able to think of this.&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, the serious and worry-filled expression Her Lady Queen had on her face was swept clean. It was replaced with an extremely sweet and enchanting smile. Excitedly, she started to jump and hop in the world spirit space. She was truly overjoyed.</p><p>Right at that moment, the nine hundred million nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine swords down below began to disappear.</p><p>It turned out that the Life Sword was the Death Sword, that the Death Sword was the Life Sword.</p><p>If one wanted to obtain the Life Sword, one must grasp the Death Sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Tell me, how did you come to realize that the Death Sword was the Life Sword?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Firstly, the Death Sword was too fast, there was simply no time for me to search for the Life Sword from the nine hundred million nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine swords. This would be extremely unreasonable unless senior had never planned to let me pass this trial to begin with.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I felt that senior was not such a person,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very good. Boy, I quite enjoy your flattery. Continue,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, there&#x2019;s the fact that senior is a very powerful slaughtering secret skill. Since the Life Sword is you, that means that the Death Sword that emitted that overwhelming power resembled you the most, that the Death Sword was most likely to also be you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, even with the analysis I made, I was still extremely nervous and uneasy before grasping the Death Sword,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn? This is quite interesting.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With how thoroughly you&#x2019;ve analyzed the matter, why would you still be nervous? Look, weren&#x2019;t you very confident the entire time?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng laughed wryly. Then, he said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not afraid of senior laughing at me. To be completely honest, I am also afraid of death. Earlier, it was truly a matter of life and death.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. Great! What a great &#x2018;I am also afraid of death.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone is afraid of death. Only those that are willing to put their lives on the line to bravely advance are able to obtain greatness.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The path of martial cultivation is like this. It is like rowing a boat upstream. The moment you stop moving forward, you&#x2019;ll start falling back.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen here possess very decent bloodlines, they ended up degenerating to their current state because they did not go forward.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A bunch of trash like them actually dared to think about subduing me all day long. They are simply delusional,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword said in a very resentful manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, it must be because you are dissatisfied with the people here that you ended up having no other choice but to choose me, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re right. Logically, I should be used by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen. However, not a single person here is capable of satisfying me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This includes that boy by the name of Zhan Haichuan from back then. Although he was quite talented, his personality was not to my liking.&#x201D;</p><p>The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword gave a long sigh</p><p>&#x201C;All these years, I have been awake the entire time and observing everything. I was searching for the fated individual to obtain me. But in a flash, many generations have passed. I have truly grown extremely lonely.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I was originally a sharp weapon for killing. Yet, I have become an object of worship. This is truly not what I desired, nor was it what my creator desired.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is truly rare for me to meet someone that suits my taste. Thus, I decided to not shackle myself and follow you,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword said.</p><p>&#x201C;But senior, you still put me through a trial, no?&#x201D; Chu Feng did not know whether to laugh or cry. Although he had managed to successfully pass the trial, when he recalled the trial, he remembered how dangerous it was. If he had taken one wrong step, there would only be one end for him.</p><p>Not to mention obtaining the acknowledgement from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword, he would likely have lost his life.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha. No matter what, I am still the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword, one of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Nine Great Secret Skills. As such, how could I casually allow myself to follow a mere boy? Naturally I would have to put you through a trial.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, even though I managed to witness all the things you&#x2019;ve done after you&#x2019;ve arrived in the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain, I was still unable to be absolutely certain about your nature. Thus, this final trial was needed to verify things.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And you did not disappoint me. Although I am not extremely satisfied, you are indeed qualified to wield my power,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, you&#x2019;re flattering me. Merely, senior, you mentioned Nine Great Secret Skills earlier? Weren&#x2019;t there supposed to only be Three Great Secret Skills?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, the people here are ignorant to everything, and simply could not be considered to be descendants of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan. The hell would they know?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back then, the ancestor of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan created a total of Nine Great Secret Skills. Those Nine Great Secret Skills all took the form of weapons, and were effective killing weapons. Each of them was stronger than the last. Even I am only ranked third among the Nine Great Secret Skills.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ranked third? Senior, with how powerful you are, you&#x2019;re actually only ranked third?&#x201D; Chu Feng was extremely shocked.</p><p>Chu Feng had experienced the aura of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword. It was truly something capable of startling heaven and earth and scaring away even ghosts and gods. It was simply boundlessly powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, I am only ranked third. However, the strength of a secret skill is related to its master. Thus, boy, if you turn out to be promising, I might not necessarily be on the losing side should I confront those two old fellows in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, Chu Feng, you must remember this. If you are to encounter the Nine Great Secret Skills, do not be scared if they are stronger than me, and do not be arrogant if they are weaker than me. In all cases, you must take them very seriously,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword said.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you for your advice, senior. This junior will keep it in mind,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, I will entrust my power to you. I hope that you do not disappoint me. Else, even if you are to die, I will still not let you get away with it,&#x201D; As the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword spoke, the golden sword Chu Feng held in his hand started to blossom with dazzling light.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, please don&#x2019;t rush to leave this quickly. Can you tell me where the main family of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan is, whether they still exist, how powerful they are and why the founder of this War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain arrived in this place with the Three Great Secret Skills?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, as this place was created by the War Clansmen, why would there be a Monstrous Clan here? What is the origin of the Monstrous Clan, and why didn&#x2019;t Zhan Haichuan eliminate them back then?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng knew that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword was going to pledge complete allegiance to him. However, Chu Feng was afraid that it would not be able to speak anymore should it do so. Thus, he hurriedly asked multiple questions that he had in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;In the vast world of martial cultivation, the heavenly dome struggles against the universe. If I were to tell you everything, wouldn&#x2019;t it become very boring?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, it is better that you find the answers yourself. If there is something that you wish to know, go and find it. Only then&#x2026; should one be delighted .&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s line of sight started to change. Soon, the space before him collapsed. Chu Feng had returned to the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain again, returned to where the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were.</p><p>However, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword&#x2019;s voice was still lingering in Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>&#x201C;In the vast world of martial cultivation, the heavenly dome struggles against the universe?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was still shocked by those words.</p><p>The reason for that was because those simple words once again told Chu Feng exactly how enormous the vast Outer World was.</p><p>Chu Feng was once again flooded with an irresistible attraction toward the Outer World.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
