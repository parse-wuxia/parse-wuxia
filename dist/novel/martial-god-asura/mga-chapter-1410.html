<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1410 - Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Lost?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, the crowd from the World Spiritist Alliance all sucked in a mouthful of cold air. Then, as if they had been petrified, they stood there in a stunned manner. As for their hearts, they were feeling extreme grievance.</p><p>What was the purpose of this gathering today? This day had been set up specifically so that they could defeat that mysterious woman and retrieve their World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s lost dignity.</p><p>However, at this moment, they were actually going to lose again. The feeling of expectations being shattered, hopes being shattered and hearts being broken filled their entire bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;Lost? You are truly indulging in fantasy!!!&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this time, the number one genius of the World Spiritist Alliance, Lin Yezhou, did not plan to give up.</p><p>He shouted angrily, and his boundless spirit power formed a protective formation around him. That protective formation was rapidly increasing in size. He was planning to break free from the golden snakes with force.</p><p>&#x201C;You are truly one who refuses to be convinced until you are faced with the grim reality. Very well, I shall give you want you want.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the time when Lin Yezhou was giving his all to resist, the woman snorted lightly. Then, she waved her sleeve and made a cross with her hand. After that, the golden snakes began to emit a frantic attractive force.</p><p>When the attractive force was unleashed, it was as if they were capable of devouring even the sun and the moon. The protective formation that Lin Yezhou had formed with his royal level spirit power was completely devoured by the golden snakes without anything being left behind.</p><p>Furthermore, at this very moment, the golden snakes were still frantically devouring Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s stamina, spirit power and even martial power.</p><p>&#x201C;Eeaaahhh~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Lin Yezhou uttered a scream. It turned out that as the golden snakes began to absorb his power, they also began to bind even tighter. Many of his bones were snapped apart by how tightly the snakes were binding. He was about to be crushed to death.</p><p>&#x201C;This strange formation, it seems to be that Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation from back then!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Miao Renlong&#x2019;s eyes shone. He turned his gaze to the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master.</p><p>As for the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master, he also came to a sudden realization after hearing what Miao Renlong said. A trace of unease and shock appeared on his previously calm face. Immediately afterward, he said, &#x201C;Stop.&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing that &#x2018;Stop&#x2019;, the mysterious woman stopped her attack. Merely, at this moment, all of Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s strength had been absorbed. He had a pale complexion and was powerless from head to toe. It was as if he was suffering from a serious illness.</p><p>Compared to Lin Yezhou, Fu Feiteng was relatively fine. Even though the golden snakes had also bound him tightly, they had not absorbed his strength and energy.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, you can stop. You&#x2019;ve already won,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master said once again.</p><p>After hearing those words, the mysterious woman waved her sleeve once again and dispersed her golden snakes.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior brother Lin!&#x201D; After the snakes were dispersed, Fu Feiteng immediately rushed to lend an arm to Lin Yezhou. That was because Lin Yezhou was truly too weak at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve lost like this?&#x201D; The crowd from the World Spiritist Alliance seemed to be unable to accept this sort of ending.</p><p>&#x201C;To be able to master the legendary Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation, little friend&#x2019;s attainments in world spirit techniques are truly universally shocking,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master added.</p><p>&#x201C;Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation? What she used earlier was that legendary spirit formation?&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing what the Alliance Master said, the expressions of many of the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Elders changed greatly. When they looked to the mysterious woman and the mysterious old man again, there was even more fear in their eyes. For some of them, they were so scared that they started to shiver.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s actually the legendary Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation? No wonder it&#x2019;s that strange. Who exactly are they? What sort of relationship do they possess with Reverend Golden Snake?&#x201D; At this moment, even Sima Ying&#x2019;s expression was filled with shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation? Reverend Golden Snake? Lil Sis Ying&#x2019;er, exactly what do you mean by that?&#x201D; It was the first time that Chu Feng had heard those names. However, he was able to tell that that formation was extremely powerful. Thus, he turned to ask Sima Ying about it.</p><p>&#x201C;Over eight thousand years ago, a royal-cloak world spiritist by the name of Reverend Golden Snake appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He had relied on a single unrivalled formation technique to defeat countless world spiritists. As for that formation technique, it was the Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Reverend Golden Snake traveled all over to challenge world spiritists. In his journey, he was never once defeated. In the end, he came to our World Spiritist Alliance and challenged our management world spiritists.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, not to mention our World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s management world spiritists, not even the seniors from our World Spiritist Sacred Assembly were a match for Reverend Golden Snake.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t for our World Spiritist Sacred Assembly&#x2019;s old ancestor coming out to save the day, it is likely that our World Spiritist Alliance would have been utterly defeated.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, after Reverend Golden Snake was defeated by our old ancestor, he vanished from society. It has been over eight thousand years since then, and no news of Reverend Golden Snake has been heard.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for his Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation, it too had disappeared for over eight thousand years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the spirit formation that girl used truly resembles the Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation,&#x201D; Sima Ying explained.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, it&#x2019;s very likely that she&#x2019;s Reverend Golden Snake&#x2019;s successor?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That old man&#x2026; in that case, that old man, could it be that he&#x2019;s Reverend Golden Snake?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that they have returned to avenge their loss?&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing Sima Ying&#x2019;s explanation, Chu Feng started to frown. He finally realized why the people from the World Spiritist Alliance would be this nervous after discovering that the spirit formation used by that mysterious woman was the Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation.</p><p>After all, that Reverend Golden Snake had been an extremely powerful character. If this old man was truly Reverend Golden Snake, it was likely that everyone present, including even the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong, would not be a match for him.</p><p>Right at this moment, that mysterious woman asked, &#x201C;Are there anymore geniuses from your World Spiritist Alliance who wish to compete against me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, you&#x2019;ve won. Currently, our World Spiritist Alliance does not possess any member of the younger generation capable of contending against you,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master said. Although his tone gave off a sense of helplessness, he was not very depressed.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, then we shall take our leave,&#x201D; That mysterious old man said. As he spoke, he prepared to bring the mysterious woman with him to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait a moment,&#x201D; Seeing this, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master immediately stood up and spoke to stop them.</p><p>&#x201C;Is there something else you need?&#x201D; The mysterious old man said those words slowly. Contained within his voice was a trace of impatience.</p><p>&#x201C;May I know if the two of you might be related to Reverend Golden Snake?&#x201D; Sure enough, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master asked that question.</p><p>&#x201C;If you had won, we would&#x2019;ve told you who we are. However, since you didn&#x2019;t win, we are not required to inform you of our identities. Farewell.&#x201D; After the mysterious old man finished saying those words, his body shifted, and he soared into the sky with the mysterious woman.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz.&#x201D; Right at this moment, golden light suddenly covered the sky. After that, a boundless world spirit power suddenly appeared like a giant net, sealing the entire vast plaza completely.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;ve come, why rush to leave?&#x201D;</p><p>Following that, two old men appeared in the sky. As for these two old men, they were the elders from the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly, Chen Sanyuan and Zhao Qinghen.</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that you all never planned to let us leave safely to begin with,&#x201D; Seeing this scene, the mysterious old man did not show any fear. Instead, he let out a mocking laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;We apologize for our actions. Merely, we wish to know exactly who we have lost to.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, that little friend there has used Reverend Golden Snake&#x2019;s Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I believe you should also know that Reverend Golden Snake possessed a special significance to our World Spiritist Alliance. Thus, we truly wish to know what sort of relationship the two of you have with Reverend Golden Snake,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master said. His tone remained extremely amiable.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, what if we refuse to tell you?&#x201D; The mysterious old man asked.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, do not blame us for being rude,&#x201D; Chen Sanyuan who stood in the sky spoke in a very impatient and aggressive manner.</p><p>His tone was very tyrannical. As an elder of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly, he was very proud of himself. Thus, he did not place the mysterious old man in his eyes at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; Surprisingly, after Chen Sanyuan said those words, the mysterious old man burst into loud laughter.</p><p>Then, he said, &#x201C;Rude? I wish to see exactly how rude you can be.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
