<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1638 - Paying The Price</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What is the meaning of this? Chu Feng is a guest invited here by me. Since when did his personal liberty become something that you all can decide on?&#x201D; Aunt Lian asked coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Nangong Lian, rest assured, I will not do anything to Chu Feng. While it is fine for you to take him away with you, the Water Immortal Profound Technique is the possession of our Nangong Imperial Clan. That he cannot take away with him,&#x201D; Nangong Huayi said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say? Cannot take away the Water Immortal Profound Technique? Are you implying that you want to kill Chu Feng?!&#x201D; At this moment, Aunt Lian was completely enraged. Even though she already knew that Nangong Huayi and the others had the intention to kill Chu Feng, she did not anticipate that they would come this quickly.</p><p>It was as Chu Feng had declared before. This Secret Skill Inheritance Assembly was simply a test. As long as he was capable of obtaining the Water Immortal Profound Technique, what awaited him would only be a path to death.</p><p>Even though Nangong Lian had anticipated this too, when all of this actually happened, she was truly unable to accept her own clan acting this shamelessly.</p><p>&#x201C;Nangong Lian, what are you thinking? Who said that one must kill another to deprive them of the secret skill? Do not forget that the White-browed Immortal is currently a nominal elder of our Nangong Imperial Clan. With his old self present, it is totally possible to strip Chu Feng of the secret skill without killing him,&#x201D; Nangong Huayi said.</p><p>&#x201C;What makes you think that we will believe you?&#x201D; Aunt Lian had an expression of disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;If you do not believe me, you can come with us,&#x201D; Nangong Huayi said.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng spoke. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Aunt Lian was startled.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian, I believe that they will not harm me. After all, this is the Nangong Imperial Clan. I believe they will not do something like bullying the weak,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Look, even Chu Feng is speaking like this. Are you still going to stop us?&#x201D; Nangong Huayi asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, I&#x2019;ll go with you all,&#x201D; Aunt Lian said.</p><p>&#x201C;No problem,&#x201D; Nangong Huayi smiled lightly. Then, his body started to move as he began to lead the way.</p><p>As for Nangong Rongsheng, he did not leave with Nangong Huayi right away. Instead, he continued to stand beside Chu Feng and Aunt Lian. It was only when Chu Feng and Aunt Lian began to follow Nangong Huayi that Nangong Rongsheng started to follow too.</p><p>Even though the Nangong Imperial Clan was located within a city wall, it was actually extremely vast. Not only were there gorgeous buildings built with gold, there were also boundless lakes, extremely long and continuous rivers and unbroken mountain ranges.</p><p>Nangong Huayi brought Chu Feng and Aunt Lian to a mountain range. Then, he stopped.</p><p>After Chu Feng landed on the mountain range, he began to inspect his surroundings. He discovered that this was a very good location to silence someone. Thus, he started to laugh grimly in his heart.</p><p>Aunt Lian&#x2019;s gaze turned sharp as she asked cautiously, &#x201C;Where is the spirit formation that you all spoke of? Where is White-browed Immortal?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; something like this does not require Immortal to act personally,&#x201D; Nangong Huayi said.</p><p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke with a cold voice. &#x201C;Enough of your rubbish. If you wish to kill me, go right ahead.&#x201D; As he spoke, he secretly placed his two hands in one location. There was only a slight distance between his palms.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what do you mean by that? Why is it that I am confused?&#x201D; Nangong Huayi asked in a manner feigning puzzlement.</p><p>&#x201C;A bunch of untrustworthy people, yet you still pretend to be confused? You don&#x2019;t understand what I meant? That&#x2019;s no issue, I&#x2019;ll tell you all what I meant.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Firstly, it is not I, Chu Feng, who wanted to participate in the Secret Skill Inheritance Assembly. It is you all who invited me there.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What was the intention behind your invitation? Wasn&#x2019;t it just so that you could give me a chance to obtain the secret skill? And now, after the secret skill has chosen me, you all decided to refuse to acknowledge that fact, and want to strip me of the secret skill.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would be one thing if you were to really to strip the secret skill from my body. However, is there a need for you to find such a hidden location to do so? It is simply clear that you all consider me to be a thorn and want to eliminate me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Do it,&#x201D; After Chu Feng said those words, Nangong Huayi&#x2019;s expression turned cold. He waved his sleeve, and a dazzling golden-bright whip appeared in his hand. Then, he aimed at Aunt Lian and explosively lashed his whip at her.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; Seeing this scene, Aunt Lian wanted to dodge. However, Nangong Rongsheng was grabbing onto her unwaveringly. In the end, she watched as the golden-bright and dazzling whip wrapped itself around her, binding her tightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Nangong Huayi, Nangong Rongsheng, what are you two doing?! Release me immediately! Else, I&#x2019;ll have you two suffer the consequences of your actions!&#x201D;</p><p>Aunt Lian was struggling with her all. However, all of her struggles were useless. That whip possessed the power to bind her. Furthermore, Nangong Rongsheng was sending Emperor-level martial power to that whip nonstop. Thus, Aunt Lian was simply unable to break free.</p><p>At this moment, Aunt Lian was filled with regret. She felt that she had been foolish. She clearly knew that Nangong Rongsheng and Nangong Huayi could not be trusted. Yet, she had still brought Chu Feng to this place. In the end, she had ended up harming Chu Feng.</p><p>Nangong Huayi completely ignored Aunt Lian&#x2019;s curses. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng and laughed, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you are very smart indeed. You actually managed to guess that we will not let you get away.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I&#x2019;m confused. Since you already knew that an imminent catastrophe was about to befall you, why would you still cooperate with us and come to this place? Could it be that you really do not fear death?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who wouldn&#x2019;t fear death? Merely, I do not fear you all,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What arrogance! Even when facing a great catastrophe, you actually dare to talk back.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I know that you possess an extraordinary origin, and that you are a guest invited to our Nangong Imperial Clan by Nangong Lian.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How about this? If you are to voluntarily renounce the Water Immortal Profound Technique and remove it from your body, I will leave you with an intact corpse,&#x201D; Nangong Huayi said.</p><p>&#x201C;Voluntarily renounce it? Why would I renounce it? The Water Immortal Profound Technique has chosen me. That means that it has acknowledged me. How could I possibly betray its kind intentions?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Moreover, when the Water Immortal Profound Technique chose me today, your Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s younger generation was also present. Yet, the Water Immortal Profound Technique still chose me. Why is that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The way I see it, it isn&#x2019;t that my talent is too outstanding. Rather, it is that your Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s younger generation is too useless.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Especially those three princes and that princess who has altered her appearance. Not only do they lack talent, their moral quality is extremely lacking too. If the Water Immortal Profound Technique were to follow them, wouldn&#x2019;t it be wronging the great secret technique?&#x201D; Chu Feng mocked and ridiculed.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I know that you only dare to spout falseness because you know that you will not be able to live. However, I&#x2019;m telling you this, those who dare to insult our Nangong Imperial Clan will have to pay the price.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will not let you die peacefully. I will make you endure suffering, make you beg me to kill you. That is the price that you must pay for insulting our Nangong Imperial Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; Suddenly, Chu Feng burst into loud laughter. His laughter was extremely loud, so loud that he scared all of the birds in a thousand miles radius into the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you laughing about?&#x201D; Nangong Huayi asked coldly. He was truly unable to understand the young man before him. This Chu Feng simply had the appearance of fearlessness. However, the more Chu Feng acted this way, the more Nangong Huayi felt that he could not be left alive. The reason for that was because this child was emitting an aura from head to toe, the aura of danger.</p><p>&#x201C;Price, what a price.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I possess neither grievance nor hatred with your Nangong Imperial Clan. Yet, you all want to kill me. You all are simply people who cannot be reasoned with, people who totally disregard the lives of others.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, let me tell you this. I, Chu Feng, am not someone who is easily bullied. You wish to kill me, Chu Feng? I will also make your Nangong Imperial Clan pay the price.&#x201D; At this moment, an expression of anger and ruthlessness flashed through Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
