<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1633 - Battle Power That Surmounts Four Levels Of Cultivation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Since you&#x2019;ve decided, let&#x2019;s do it like this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. How do you feel right now? Did you manage to obtain a new power from the Divine Lightnings?&#x201D; Eggy asked curiously.</p><p>Chu Feng extended his hands and spun around in a circle. Then, he asked with a smile on his face, &#x201C;What sort of change do you see?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no change. Other than becoming a rank one Half Martial Emperor from rank nine Martial King, there&#x2019;s no change whatsoever,&#x201D; Eggy said after she carefully inspected Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, try receiving a fist of mine,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Come, this Queen doesn&#x2019;t fear you,&#x201D; Eggy said with confidence.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng attacked. His fist strike was faster than lightning, heavier than a mountain. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>However, this sort of fist strike was unable to reach Eggy at all. Before it could touch her, a layer of black gaseous flames stopped it.</p><p>&#x201C;Milady Queen, it is truly fortunate that you are not my enemy. Your power is too frightening.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng retrieved his fist while smiling. This was the first time he had exchanged blows with Eggy. It was also the first time he had felt the power of Asura. This power was extremely frightening. Even though Chu Feng had become a Half Martial Emperor and obtained new strength, he still felt extremely inferior when facing Eggy.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re pretty good yourself. A battle power that surmounts four levels of cultivation. Likely, in the Holy Land of Martialism, other than that so-called little princess from the Elf Kingdom, only you are capable of accomplishing this,&#x201D; Eggy said with a beaming smile.</p><p>She had already known what sort of new strength Chu Feng had obtained. Even though what Chu Feng had obtained was not the same sort of thing as the Thunder Armor or the Thunder Wings, two abilities similar to martial skills that could instantly increase his cultivation by one level, he had obtained heaven-defying battle power.</p><p>In the past, Chu Feng had possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. As a rank one Half Martial Emperor, he was able to contend against ordinary rank four Half Martial Emperors.</p><p>However, now that Chu Feng had obtained a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, it meant that the current Chu Feng was capable of contending against ordinary rank five Half Martial Emperors with his cultivation of rank one Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>In the Holy Land of Martialism, all of the first-rate geniuses possessed heaven-defying battle power. This sort of heaven-defying battle power ranged from being capable of surmounting one level of cultivation to being capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p><p>However, even the peak geniuses would only possess battle prowess capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. For example, Tantai Xue, Nangong Ya and Nangong Baihe all possessed battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p><p>In fact, even the current Su Mei, Su Rou and Zi Ling possessed battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p><p>However, the current Chu Feng possessed battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. In other words, even if he were to face the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s peak geniuses, as long as they were at the same level of cultivation as him, Chu Feng would be able to easily crush his opponents.</p><p>Furthermore, reportedly, other than the Elf Kingdom&#x2019;s little princess, there was no one in the current Holy Land of Martialism who possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p><p>However, this was not the important matter. Most importantly, heaven-defying battle power was something that could generally be determined easily. Oftentimes, one could tell what sort of battle power another possessed with a single glance.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was different. On the surface, he still only gave off the appearance of someone with heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Only when one really fought him, and only when he was willing to reveal his heaven-defying battle power that was capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation would others be able to discover his actual battle power.</p><p>This was also the reason why Eggy was only able to tell that Chu Feng possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation after receiving a fist strike from him.</p><p>&#x201C;Other than this heaven-defying battle power, did you manage to gain anything else?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I came to have a bit better of an understanding of the Divine Lightnings in my body. If I were to use One Shot Lightning again, it would likely not be as strenuous as before. The burden on my body will be lessened,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s pretty good. If we calculate it according to this, then when you become a Martial Emperor, wouldn&#x2019;t you be able to possess heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation? At that time, Martial Emperors at the same level of cultivation as you will be no match for you. Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Eggy laughed very happily. There was actually a reason why she was laughing this happily.</p><p>Peak geniuses all possessed heaven-defying battle power. As Chu Feng came in contact with more experts, it was not hard to discover that, at this moment, the only people of his generation capable of contending against him were people who possessed heaven-defying battle power.</p><p>In fact, of all those who were able to become Martial Emperors, who among them did not possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation? If one did not even possess that bit of talent, how could one become a Martial Emperor?</p><p>In other words, once one reached the Martial Emperor realm, heaven-defying battle power would become meaningless. The reason for that was because everyone would possess the same heaven-defying battle power.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was different. Chu Feng had now obtained a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. When facing geniuses of the same level of cultivation as him, he would be able to gain dominance over them with his additional heaven-defying battle power. In the future, when he became a Martial Emperor, Chu Feng would still be able to gain dominance over others.</p><p>Furthermore, after Chu Feng became a Martial Emperor, the dominance he possessed might be even greater. After all, with the way things seemed now, Chu Feng would be able to obtain even stronger heaven-defying battle power after becoming a Martial Emperor. Like Eggy had said, Chu Feng might obtain a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation after becoming a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Even though all Martial Emperors possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation and could cancel out Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power with theirs, Chu Feng would still be able to gain dominance over them with the additional two levels of cultivation that he could surmount with his battle power.</p><p>Just thinking about how Chu Feng would be able to contend against rank three Martial Emperors when he became a rank one Martial Emperor would definitely stun a lot of people.</p><p>This enormously powerful strength was something bestowed to Chu Feng by his Divine Lightnings. In the end, it was still his bloodline, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Inherited Bloodline that was too powerful.</p><p>This had predestined it from the very beginning that Chu Feng would continue on growing. Sooner or later, he would leave the people from the Holy Land of Martialism far far behind. Only the people from the Outer World would be able to keep pace with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Creak~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, the door to Chu Feng&#x2019;s room was pushed open. It was Aunt Lian.</p><p>Even though it was Aunt Lian, Eggy still hurriedly returned to Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit space.</p><p>&#x201C;Is Chu Feng here?&#x201D;</p><p>Aunt Lian was a world spiritist. She was able to tell with a single glance that there was a spirit formation around Chu Feng&#x2019;s room. Thus, she did not force her way in, and instead asked about Chu Feng&#x2019;s presence.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng waved his sleeve, removed his spirit formation and revealed himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Sure enough, you&#x2019;ve managed a breakthrough. Congratulations!&#x201D; Aunt Lian spoke with a beaming smile when she saw Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian, I believe I&#x2019;ve stirred up trouble, no?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Stirred up trouble? What do you mean by that?&#x201D; Aunt Lian pretended that nothing had happened.</p><p>&#x201C;The abnormal sign I caused from my breakthrough should have had some effect on the Nangong Imperial Clan. Could it be that no one felt me to be a threat?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course there are. However, it is not a major issue,&#x201D; Aunt Lian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Is it really not a major issue? In that case, if I wish to leave here right now, will I be allowed to?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; At this moment, Aunt Lian started to hesitate. Then, she removed her smile and said, &#x201C;Really, I cannot hide anything from you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, the current situation is special. However, please do not blame them. After all, as the upper echelons of the Nangong Imperial Clan, they must consider the greater good, they must take responsibility for the future of the Nangong Imperial Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if you do as I say, I guarantee you that you&#x2019;ll be safe and sound, and that no one in the entire Nangong Imperial Clan will harm you,&#x201D; Aunt Lian said.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
