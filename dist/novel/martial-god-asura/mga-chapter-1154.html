<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1154 - Firmament Adamantine Metal</strong></p><p>Before the two&#x2019;s anticipating gazes, the gate slowly opened. At the same time, a different world appeared before their eyes.</p><p>It was a space. However, it appeared more like a palace hall, a palace hall that was not very large, yet still exceptionally refined.</p><p>The walls of this palace hall were neither gold nor silver; they were actually made of crystals. Furthermore, even though they were made of crystals, they were no ordinary crystals. Even though they were dazzling, they were not enough to blind one&#x2019;s eyes. The only sensation that those crystals gave them could be described with a single word: breathtaking.</p><p>However, if one mentioned breathtaking, then the things in the palace hall would be enough to astonish both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.</p><p>There were all kinds of fruits of different shapes and sizes. Some appeared like mangos, some like apples, and some were even as large as watermelons. However, none of them were ordinary fruits.</p><p>That was because not only were they shining with different colored lights, they also contained very dense natural energy. As for the natural energies, the most dense among them would be Martial Energy. This was no ordinary Martial Energy, it was king level Martial Energy. All of these fruits were cultivation resources, Natural Oddities.</p><p>&#x201C;What a great amount of Natural Fruits[1.technically, it said natural odd fruit; natural oddities in fruit form?].&#x201D; At this moment, it was not only Chu Feng who was displaying a face of joy, even Bai Ruochen was the same. That was because, to them, what they needed the most was not money or valuables. Instead, what they needed were the Natural Fruits that could assist with their training.</p><p>&#x201C;This is truly great. These Natural Fruits, they should all be king level Martial Medicines, right?&#x201D; gasped Chu Feng with admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re not only king level Martial Medicines, they&#x2019;re top quality king level Martial Medicines. Even though they contain very dense king level Martial Energies, those energies are not very frantic. Thus, it would be much easier to refine them. To us Martial Kings, these are the most precious cultivation resources,&#x201D; replied Bai Ruochen.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh.&#x201D; Right at the moment when Bai Ruochen was speaking, Chu Feng suddenly moved. A suction power was explosively shot forth and countless king level Martial Medicines started to float into the air. In the end, they were all sucked into Chu Feng&#x2019;s Cosmos Sack.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not take all of them. He had only taken half of the king level Martial Medicines in the palace hall; half still remained.</p><p>&#x201C;Half each, there&#x2019;s no complaint, right?&#x201D; said Chu Feng with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;My intentions exactly.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen smiled lightly. After that, she also took out a Cosmos Sack. Like Chu Feng, she began to suck the king level Martial Medicines into her Cosmos Sack.</p><p>Even though what Chu Feng needed the most were cultivation resources like this, he did not feel any unwillingness as he saw Bai Ruochen gathering the remaining half of the king level Martial Medicines.</p><p>Firstly, these were indeed things that Bai Ruochen deserved. After all, these were originally left behind by the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s ancestor for the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s descendants. Chu Feng was not a descendant of the Ascension Sect; thus, it was already a great benefit for him to be able to obtain half.</p><p>Besides, Chu Feng was able to tell from Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s joyous reaction that she appeared to need these cultivation resources very much too. Otherwise, with her temperament, it was impossible for her to become this excited. Thus, Chu Feng felt that he should allow her to get her share.</p><p>&#x201C;That is?&#x201D; However, right at this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes shone. Then, he became stunned. After Bai Ruochen gathered up the remaining king level Martial Medicines into her Cosmos Sack, the palace hall did not become empty. There were actually things remaining in the palace hall.</p><p>Three items appeared in the center of this palace hall. Those three items appeared to be steel, but were abnormally structured. All three of them were rectangular-shaped, two feet thick, one meter wide and three meters long. They were placed there in an orderly manner.</p><p>Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that even if these three items were steel, they were no ordinary steel. Even though they did not emit any kind of exotic shine, and appeared like scraps as they were placed there, Chu Feng was able to sense that these pieces of steel were indestructible. They were simply frighteningly tough and sturdy. However, what surprised Chu Feng the most was that these three pieces of steel actually contained spirituality; it was as if they possessed life.</p><p>&#x201C;What are those?&#x201D; At this moment, Bai Ruochen also noticed them. Furthermore, she had arrived before the three steel-like items. In a surprised manner, she said. &#x201C;There are words written on them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng hurriedly walked toward the three steel-like items as well. Only then did he discover that there were indeed words written on the three lumps of steel.</p><p>&#x201C;Firmament Adamantine Metal. Originally Adamantine Metal buried in the depths of the underground. Due to having absorbed the Firmament energy for tens of thousands of years, they have ultimately evolved into Firmament Adamantine Metal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Firmament Adamantine Metal&#x2019;s entire body is indestructible. It is capable of breaking through everything in its path. It is one of the rare steels in this world, and can be used as a foundation for Imperial Armaments.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Firmament Adamantine Metal could be considered to be a priceless treasure. If a descendant from my sect was to obtain these, then they must not expose them to the world, nor should they sell them. They can only use them for themselves. If these metals cannot be used in their lifetime, then they must be saved for the later generations and not wasted.&#x201D;</p><p>These words were extremely strong and powerful. It could be seen that the person who had written these words had possessed a very powerful cultivation. However, even though that was the case, these words were only shallowly imprinted on the Firmament Adamantine Metal, and not carved deeply into it.</p><p>From this, one could tell that these pieces of Firmament Adamantine Metal were truly indestructible and were rare treasures.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re actually treasures used to craft Imperial Armaments.&#x201D; When he discovered the origins of these three lumps of metal, Chu Feng was unable to contain his shock.</p><p>That was because he was able to tell the worth of these pieces of Firmament Adamantine Metal without even thinking about it; they were much more precious than the king level Martial Medicines that he and Bai Ruochen had collected. In other words, these pieces of Firmament Adamantine Metal were the true treasures that the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s ancestor had wanted to leave for his descendants.</p><p>After all, Imperial Armaments were extremely exceptional. It was likely that anything that was related to Imperial Armaments would be capable of enticing countless experts. It was even more so for foundation materials used to craft Imperial Armaments.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz.&#x201D; Right at this moment, Bai Ruochen suddenly moved. Using her Cosmos Sack, she directly absorbed one piece of Firmament Adamantine Metal into it.</p><p>After that, she looked to the two remaining pieces of Firmament Adamantine Metal on the floor, then turned to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;The ancestor&#x2019;s intentions are very clear. He wanted his descendants to be capable of utilizing this Firmament Adamantine Metal to craft an Imperial Armament.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if his descendants were incapable of crafting an Imperial Armament, then he wanted them to not waste these priceless treasures. However, selling them was also prohibited, and they must be saved for the descendants of the Ascension Sect.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are you capable of accomplishing the requests laid out by my Ascension Sect&#x2019;s ancestor?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will most definitely not fail to live up to the expectations of the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s ancestor.&#x201D; Chu Feng replied with full confidence.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, these remaining two, you can take them both.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen left these words and then proceeded to walk toward the entrance of the palace hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Lil Sis Ruochen, are you certain? You&#x2019;re planning to leave two for me? This is not too good, is it?&#x201D; Chu Feng was surprised. Treasures like these, if Bai Ruochen was to give him a single one, she would already be showing a great consideration toward him. However, she actually decided to give him two. This caused Chu Feng to be truly humbled.</p><p>&#x201C;What I need the most right now are cultivation resources. Although these pieces of Firmament Adamantine Metal are precious, one is enough for me. As for those two, just accept them both. Your spirit formation techniques greatly exceed mine; your future accomplishments in that would most definitely be greater than mine. I believe that sooner or later, you will end up using those pieces of Firmament Adamantine Metal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Moreover, for us to be able to find this place, your contributions greatly surpassed mine. If it wasn&#x2019;t for you, I might not even have had the chance to see this palace hall, much less obtain the treasures within it. In all sense and reason, you should have a greater share than me,&#x201D; said Bai Ruochen.</p><p>After hearing what Bai Ruochen said, Chu Feng smiled a relieved smile. Since Bai Ruochen had already spoken like that, if Chu Feng continued to modestly decline, it would turn to him being in the wrong. Thus, Chu Feng received the two remaining pieces of Firmament Adamantine Metal.</p><p>&#x201C;Firmament Energy, could it be related to the Firmament Medicinal Herbs?&#x201D; At this moment, another question emerged in Chu Feng&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>However, this was merely a question. Chu Feng did not try to think too deeply into it, as he had already obtained his share of profit.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
