<p><strong> Chapter 1904 - The Situation Turning Bad</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, do you dare to accept my challenge?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal asked again.</p><p>&#x201C;Avaricious Immortal, you are, no matter what, a senior. Please mind your words and actions so that you do not disgrace yourself,&#x201D; Princess Lingyue said coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Princess Lingyue, you don&#x2019;t understand. This old man is currently protecting his dignity as a world spiritist. Else, I will have no face to continue existing in the Holy Land of Martialism,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal defended his actions.</p><p>&#x201C;Face? Someone like you needs face? You should know your own conduct and deeds the best. I might as well tell you the truth. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that the Immeasurable Immortal insisted on bringing you to assist him with making the Blood Devouring Armor, our Elf Kingdom would never associate ourselves with someone like you,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said without the slightest trace of politeness.</p><p>Regardless of how thick-skinned the Avaricious Immortal might be, he was on the verge of being unable to endure such open humiliation by Xian Miaomiao. His complexion turned ashen and his expression became extremely ugly.</p><p>Thus, he turned to Chu Feng and said again, &#x201C;Chu Feng, are you a man or not?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng did not answer and instead burst into cold laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you laughing about?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal asked loudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Am I muddle-headed? Why is it that the things happening today resemble what happened yesterday that much?&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he took a glance at Xian Yuyin.</p><p>Yesterday, when Xian Yuyin was challenging Chu Feng, he had the exact same attitude as the Avaricious Immortal. However, in the end, he suffered a crushing defeat.</p><p>What Chu Feng meant by those words of his was that the Avaricious Immortal&#x2026; would end up suffering the same conclusion as Xian Yuyin.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, I knew that you wouldn&#x2019;t dare,&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng had refused to accept his challenge even now, the Avaricious Immortal smiled coldly. Then, he took a glance at the crowd and said, &#x201C;Princesses, Young Masters, Milords, you have all seen it. Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques are simply inferior to my own. His questioning my decision is simply slander to my name.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Avaricious, never did I mention that I wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you saying that you will compete with me?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Compete, of course we must compete. If we do not compete, you wouldn&#x2019;t know how weak you really are. However, if we must compete, then we must set some conditions. Merely, I fear that you will not dare to accept them,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What jest. What would I not dare to accept? What is the condition? Speak away,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;We shall bet our lives. Do you dare to accept?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say? You wish to gamble your life with me?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal was startled upon hearing those words. He was originally planning to use that to scare Chu Feng. Never had he thought that Chu Feng would use that condition to scare him instead.</p><p>In fact, at that moment, the crowd present was completely startled.</p><p>What sort of situation was this?</p><p>No matter how enormous the hatred between Chu Feng and the Avaricious Immortal might be, there shouldn&#x2019;t be a need to gamble their lives with world spirit techniques, no? With Chu Feng&#x2019;s current strength, he was simply capable of using his own martial cultivation to kill the Avaricious Immortal. There was simply no need for him to take that risk.</p><p>Or could it be that Chu Feng really possessed sufficient confidence in being able to surpass the Avaricious Immortal even in world spirit techniques?</p><p>The crowd began to have all sorts of speculations. However, at the same time, they all held a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng. This young man&#x2019;s courage was simply too astonishing.</p><p>&#x201C;Sure, let&#x2019;s compete. I shall see how you could possibly surpass me!&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal shouted. He accepted Chu Feng&#x2019;s condition.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. How do you want to compete? You decide.&#x201D; Chu Feng handed the responsibility of deciding the subject of the competition to the Avaricious Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh, there&#x2019;s no need for you to tell me to decide. As your senior, it is only natural that I decide,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal did not appreciate Chu Feng&#x2019;s gesture.</p><p>However, his words caused the crowd to shake their heads repeatedly. He truly lacked the demeanor of a senior. When comparing him with Chu Feng, Chu Feng&#x2019;s conduct in every deed appeared better than the Avaricious Immortal all around.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll set up a formation, and you shall attempt to break through it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You will do the same, and set up a formation for me to attempt to break through.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No more than six hours can be used to set up the formation. No more than one hour can be used to break through the formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you cannot break through my formation, it&#x2019;ll be your loss.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I cannot break through your formation, it&#x2019;ll be my loss,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Six hours to set up a formation and one hour to break through it? How could one possibly break through it?&#x201D; Hearing what the Avaricious Immortal said, the crowd members were all astonished. The rules which he gave were truly too unreasonable.</p><p>However, compared to the others, Chu Feng only smiled lightly. With an indifferent expression on his face, he said, &#x201C;What if I manage to break through your formation, but you cannot break through mine?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That would mean that I, Avaricious, am inferior to you. I will publicly kneel on the spot and call you granddaddy,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal said resentfully. Even though he was surprised by Chu Feng deciding to bet with their lives, he was still absolutely confident in himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. Come,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled slightly and indicated to the Avaricious Immortal to start.</p><p>&#x201C;The palace hall is too small. Let&#x2019;s go outside,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal snorted coldly and then began to fly outside.</p><p>Chu Feng followed closely behind him. The others in the palace hall also flew after them.</p><p>At that moment, the grand characters were all standing in the sky. Their gazes were bright and their expressions were serious.</p><p>Although they, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, possessed extremely powerful battle power, their world spirit techniques were generally only average. For two Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists to compete, and in a life and death match on top of that, they all knew that it was a great show that was not to be missed.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the Avaricious Immortal started to act. His hands began to move back and forth. As his hands gave birth to winds, golden-bright and dazzling Dragon Mark Royal-level world spirit power ended up being controlled by him.</p><p>He was setting up a formation, a very powerful grand spirit formation. While this grand spirit formation was a defensive formation, it was most definitely no ordinary defensive formation.</p><p>This grand formation was separated into eighty-one smaller formations. However, even for the smaller formations, they each covered several thousands of meters. With the eighty-one smaller formations crisscrossing one another, they created this enormous formation that covered several tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>The Avaricious Immortal was truly worthy of being a world spiritist ranked higher than the World Spiritist Immortal and the White-browed Immortal among the Ten Immortals. His world spirit techniques were indeed extremely profound.</p><p>However, even for him, a very powerful world spiritist, it still required a total of six hours to set up that enormous spirit formation. He finished his spirit formation right at the six hour mark.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, go ahead and attempt to break it,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal said as he pointed to the enormous spirit formation shining with golden light behind him. Confidence filled his aged face.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; how is one to break through that formation?&#x201D; Seeing that formation, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves all started to frown.</p><p>Even though none of them were very proficient with world spirit techniques, they were able to tell that the Avaricious Immortal&#x2019;s spirit formation was especially useful against world spirit techniques.</p><p>In other words, it would actually be extremely easy to break through the formation with martial power. With Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation, it would be as simple as waving his sleeve.</p><p>However, if one were to use world spirit techniques, it would be extremely difficult, so difficult that it was simply impossible.</p><p>&#x201C;Truly despicable,&#x201D; At this moment, the grand characters of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves that were generally very calm were unable to contain themselves, and began to audibly despise the Avaricious Immortal.</p><p>The Avaricious Immortal declared that six hours would be the time limit to set up the formation. Furthermore, it just so happened that he had finished setting up his spirit formation in six hours. Evidently, he had already planned this beforehand.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng was too careless. He shouldn&#x2019;t have allowed that Avaricious Immortal to give his conditions. Look at it now, that Avaricious Immortal possesses an advantage all around,&#x201D; At that moment, Princess Lingyue&#x2019;s gaze was flickering. She had a worried expression on her face.</p><p>The way she saw it, the situation was extremely bad for Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
