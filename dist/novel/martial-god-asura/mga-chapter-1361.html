<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1361 - Staying Behind To Enjoy The Show</strong></p><p>&#x201C;You wish to bribe me with wealth? I&#x2019;m sorry, my dignity is not something that can be purchased,&#x201D; Chu Feng snorted coldly and refused the Village Chief&#x2019;s offer through voice transmission.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, this old man is truly doing this because I have no other choice. Please accept the grievances for a short period of time, this old man will definitely return your innocence later,&#x201D; The Old Village Chief said. Not only was his tone extremely sincere, it was also very apologetic.</p><p>At this time, Chu Feng was slightly moved. If this Old Village Chief was a despicable person like Zhou Sitian, there would be no reason for him to say these things to Chu Feng through voice transmission.</p><p>No matter what, he was the master of the Sealing Ancient Village, an unfathomably strong expert. As for Chu Feng, he was only a person from the younger generation with a low level of cultivation.</p><p>In truth, there was simply no need for him to lower himself and say these things to Chu Feng. The fact that he actually spoke to Chu Feng like this meant that he felt ashamed in his heart and was forced to wrongly accuse Chu Feng because he had no other choice.</p><p>&#x201C;Bro, bro, brother Chu Feng, is tha, tha, that old fart cr, crazy or what? Af, after he wr, wrongly accused us, he actually secretly sen, sent a voice transmission to ap, apologize to me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He ev, even said that he would se, secretly give me the re, rewards for the sec, second place and ev, even double them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Say, do you th, think that this old fart is plan, planning to secretly dea, deal with us? Ex, exactly what is he trying to do?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this time, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s voice transmission suddenly entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears. It turned out that that the Old Village Chief had not only said these words to Chu Feng, he had also said them to Wang Qiang.</p><p>Likely, he really was ashamed in his heart. Else, there would be no reason for him to say these things to Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you want the compensation that he&#x2019;s offering?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked Wang Qiang via voice transmission.</p><p>&#x201C;Of, of, of course. On, only a fool would not wa, want it. Me, merely, I do not kn, know whether or not thi, this old fart is tr, trustworthy,&#x201D; Wang Qiang replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Let me discuss it with him,&#x201D; After Chu Feng finished saying these words to Wang Qiang, he turned to the Old Village Chief and said via voice transmission, &#x201C;When are you planning to return our innocence?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I cannot guarantee when. However, I can guarantee that I will definitely return your innocence,&#x201D; The Old Village Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, Wang Qiang and I will accept your compensation. When do you plan to give it to us?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>In truth, Chu Feng also wanted to obtain the compensation. No matter what, the compensation was a large amount of wealth. Furthermore, it would be doubled.</p><p>Earlier, Chu Feng had refused because he had felt that the Old Village Chief was bribing him with the compensation of twice the reward so that he would accept what had happened.</p><p>Naturally, Chu Feng was unwilling to do that. After all, to Chu Feng, his dignity was the most important matter; it was not something that he would allow others to trample upon.</p><p>However, the situation was different now. The Old Village Chief had promised that he would return their innocence in the future. This meant that he was not trying to present Chu Feng with a compensation of twice the reward to bribe him. Instead, he was only trying to make up to Chu Feng.</p><p>With that being the case, there would be no reason for Chu Feng to not accept the compensation. After all, he had been wronged already. Even if he was promised to be able to obtain his innocence in the future, he could not accept being wronged in vain. Only by obtaining some compensation would he not be totally in the loss.</p><p>It was as Wang Qiang said, only a fool would not want the compensation.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friends, after the two of you leave, please stay around the outside of the village. Do not go too far, I will come and find you,&#x201D; The Old Village Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, I hope that you do not go back on your word,&#x201D; After Chu Feng finished saying these words, he sent a voice transmission to Wang Qiang informing him about the matter.</p><p>&#x201C;Ar, are you cer, certain that he wi, will not se, secretly kill us to si, silence us?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked with great worry.</p><p>&#x201C;He won&#x2019;t. If he truly wished to kill us, we would not be able to escape anyways.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let alone, if we are to die here, then once the news of our death is spread, people will definitely think that it was the Sealing Ancient Village who killed us. I do not believe they will dare to do that,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with confidence.</p><p>&#x201C;O, o, okay then. I&#x2019;ll do as you say. Let, let, let&#x2019;s leave and wa, wait for that old fart,&#x201D; As Wang Qiang spoke, he caught up to Chu Feng and prepared to leave alongside him.</p><p>&#x201C;Yooah, this place is truly bustling with noise and excitement,&#x201D; However, right at this time, a voice suddenly sounded from outside the village.</p><p>From where Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were standing, they were able to clearly see that five young people were walking toward them.</p><p>They were three men and two women. The men possessed robust statures and handsome appearances, whereas the women possessed beautiful faces. They were simply a group of handsome men and beautiful women.</p><p>All five of them were wearing golden world spiritist cloaks. Walking over here together, they were extremely eye-catching.</p><p>That was because not only did they have handsome and beautiful appearances, their cultivation was also very strong. Among them, the two women were the same as Chu Feng, both being rank five Martial Kings.</p><p>As for the men, two among them possessed the same cultivation as Wang Qiang, both being rank seven Martial Kings. As for the final man, he was relatively older than the rest, being in his thirties. As for his cultivation, he was actually a rank eight Martial King.</p><p>Furthermore, their auras were also extraordinary. They were definitely not simple people. Even though they were all world spiritists, they all possessed heaven-defying battle power.</p><p>With their cultivation at their age, they were definitely geniuses. However, this was not the most important matter. The most important matter was that they all had a title plate hanging on their waists. It was the title plate of the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>These three men and two women were all people from the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>&#x201C;People from the World Spiritist Alliance? Why did they come here?&#x201D;</p><p>When they saw these five young people, the crowd present were all surprised. This was especially true of the people from the Sealing Ancient Village, because unease appeared on all of their faces.</p><p>At this time, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were standing next to one another. Confused by the reaction of the people from the Sealing Ancient Village, Chu Feng asked, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Why does it seem like the people from the Sealing Ancient Village fear the people from the World Spiritist Alliance?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yo, yo, you do, don&#x2019;t even know about this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If one as, asks who the Se, Sealing Ancient Village fears the most, then it w, w, would definitely be the Worl, World Spiritist Alliance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the pa, past, the World Spiritist Alliance he, held a lot of fier, fierce world spirit technique contests against the Sealing Ancient Village. Ev, every single time, they wo, would ob, obtain victory over the Sealing Ancient Village.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Fu, furthermore, ev, every time, they wo, would make the Sealing Ancient Village pay bi, bitterly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As ma, matters stand, the Sealing Ancient Vi, Village is extremely pas, passive. No, not only have many of their treasures ended up in the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s hands, the pe, people from the Wo, World Spiritist Alliance also do not have to go thr, through the trials to enter here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Th, they possess special pr, privileges an, and can com, come and go as they please in the Se, Sealing Ancient Village.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ho, however, eve,every time they come, they will al, always bring misfortune with them. Th, this time, they&#x2019;ve come during the ancestral wor, worship ceremony. How could the people from the Sealing Anc, Ancient Village not be afraid?&#x201D; Wang Qiang said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case. In that case, let&#x2019;s not rush to leave. Instead, let&#x2019;s stay and enjoy the show. What say you?&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Wang Qiang with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehehe, t, that&#x2019;s what I w, was thinking too,&#x201D; Wang Qiang&#x2019;s laughter was truly vulgar, truly shameless.</p><p>Thus, neither Chu Feng nor Wang Qiang left the Sealing Ancient Village. Instead, they returned to the crowd. Because of the arrival of the five young people from the World Spiritist Alliance, no one had the time to pay attention to Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&#x2019;s actions.</p><p>At this time, everyone&#x2019;s gazes were focused upon the five young people from the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
