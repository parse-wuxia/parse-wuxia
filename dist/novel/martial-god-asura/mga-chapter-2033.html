<p><strong> Chapter 2033 - Begin The Counterattack</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng is giving it to you. Thus, just accept it. Don&#x2019;t forget, it is your responsibility to guard the safety of this place,&#x201D; The Elf King said.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Your Majesty. Little friend Chu Feng, thank you for your enormous gift,&#x201D; The Elf Lord cautiously accepted the title plate. Smiles completely filled his aged face.</p><p>Even though he did not dare to accept it, he actually deeply wanted it, as it would allow him to be able to command that stone army. Without a doubt, with the stone army, their battle power here would increase enormously.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Majesty, for the Dark Hall to attack your Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; various territories this frequently, they most definitely have camps where they station their troops.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Have you not managed to find those locations?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>Chu Feng had been to over a dozen of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; territories before coming to this territory.</p><p>He knew from them that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves were forced into an extremely passive state ever since the battle against the Dark Hall had started.</p><p>The reason why they had to act so passively was because they could only defend against the Dark Hall&#x2019;s attacks, and not fight back. As for why that was the case, it was because they did not know where the Dark Hall&#x2019;s camps were.</p><p>&#x201C;The Dark Hall is extremely cunning. Furthermore, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master possesses brilliant world spirit techniques. Not to mention knowing where their camps are, they disappear rapidly after every attack,&#x201D; The Elf King said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s indeed the case. While His Majesty is still able to chase after them, we, on the other hand, are simply unable to even catch up to them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This time around, it was that woman by the name of Xue Ji that decided to give up on the Dark Hall&#x2019;s army that came to attack us. Else, they would likely have been able to escape unscathed,&#x201D; The Elf Protector said.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case,&#x201D; Chu Feng pondered for a moment. Then, he said to the Elf King, &#x201C;Your Majesty, could you help me get in contact with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and senior Zhang Ming?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng knew that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and Zhang Ming were special among the reinforcements that had come to help the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. Other than being powerful, they were also Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists.</p><p>Thus, after they joined the battle, they were not dispatched to help protect the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; territories. Instead, they were tasked to discover the whereabouts of the Dark Hall.</p><p>&#x201C;I can.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, little friend Chu Feng, I cannot leave the Elf Kingdom for too long. My coming to this place was also done secretly. We will likely have to return to the Elf Kingdom immediately,&#x201D; The Elf King said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s fine,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>As the matter could not be delayed, they began their journey to return to the Elf Kingdom immediately. Merely, before Chu Feng left, he turned his head around and to take a glance at the battlefield behind him. His gaze was rather complicated.</p><p>&#x201C;Xue Ji?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng started to ponder after saying those two words. Even though that Xue Ji had escaped from the battle and Chu Feng could be said to have seized total victory, Chu Feng kept feeling that that woman by the name of Xue Ji was even more dangerous than the World Devastator Immortal.</p><p>The reason for that was because even after Chu Feng arrived leading the stone army, that Xue Ji did not reveal the slightest bit of fear in her eyes.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng felt a faint trace of that Xue Ji&#x2019;s aura from those Ancient Era&#x2019;s ferocious beasts.</p><p>Chu Feng had seen the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master before. He was extremely powerful and capable of fighting against the Elf King. However, Chu Feng did not sense the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master&#x2019;s aura on those Ancient Era&#x2019;s ferocious beasts.</p><p>As Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, he guessed that the Dark Hall&#x2019;s ability to control those Ancient Era&#x2019;s ferocious beasts was definitely related to that woman called Xue Ji.</p><p>In short, the existence of that woman caused Chu Feng to feel extremely uneasy.</p><p>However, as that woman had already escaped, what Chu Feng must do now was to return to the Elf Kingdom quickly to meet up with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others.</p><p>After some time passed, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and Zhang Ming, the three Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, arrived at the Elf Kingdom in succession.</p><p>At that moment, the Elf King, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and Zhang Ming were all gathered.</p><p>They still did not know what it was that Chu Feng wanted to tell them. Although Chu Feng was the first to arrive at the Elf Kingdom, he had entered closed-door training right after arriving.</p><p>Calculating the time, Chu Feng had already been in closed-door training for some days now.</p><p>Finally, after they waited for a long while, Chu Feng finally emerged from his closed-door training.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you have truly broadened our horizons.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Never would I have expected for the treasures of the Five Elements Secret Skills to be the stone army. To our current situation, they could be said to be the most useful,&#x201D; At that moment, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was extremely cheerful. He had heard about the matter regarding the stone army from the Elf King. However, after he carefully looked to Chu Feng, he asked, &#x201C;Hm, where&#x2019;s the Immeasurable Immortal? Where did he go?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, I have called you all here mainly because I have two things that I wish to tell you all,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Hearing those words, the expressions of the crowd present all turned serious. They were able to tell that what Chu Feng planned to tell them was something important.</p><p>&#x201C;For the first matter, the Immeasurable Immortal is a part of the Dark Hall. Furthermore, he possesses another identity by the name of Zhan Cangtian.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He completely revealed himself at the Wonderstone Dao Ground. He admitted to everything, and even tried to kill me together with the World Devastator Immortal. Fortunately, I was prepared. That was why I managed to escape the calamity,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What? The Immeasurable Immortal is Zhan Cangtian?&#x201D;</p><p>After learning of this matter, it was not only the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and Zhang Ming were shocked, even the Elf King started to frown. Evidently, none of them had expected the Immeasurable Immortal to possess such a dangerous identity.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it. No wonder no one could find Zhan Cangtian even though he possessed countless enemies. So he actually had another identity as the Immeasurable Immortal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And I, I actually knew that guy for so long. This is truly disgusting!&#x201D; At that moment, the Snow-haired Immortal started to voice her complaints. It could be seen that the Snow-haired Immortal also deeply loathed Zhan Cangtian.</p><p>&#x201C;Truth be told, I was only able to obtain the Five Elements Secret Skills because of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master&#x2019;s deliberate planning. The Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace have submitted to the Dark Hall. They deliberately attacked the Cyanwood Mountain on their orders.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Their attack on the Cyanwood Mountain was so that I could obtain the Five Elements Secret Skills and attempt to assimilate them,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s actually such a thing? Then what about the Underworld Palace? Could the Underworld Palace also have submitted to the Dark Hall?&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;The Underworld Palace did not submit to the Dark Hall. They should be truly planning to become our allies. Back then, I had already obtained four of the Five Elements Secret Skills. The only one that I lacked was that Underworld Palace&#x2019;s one. As such, it was reasonable for them to gift me the secret skill.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I believe the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had also considered that,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;The Dark Hall is truly treacherous,&#x201D; After knowing the truth, the crowd all started to frown. The various methods of the Dark Hall had all surpassed their imagination.</p><p>This time around, Chu Feng had already been prepared. If Chu Feng had also been deceived by the Immeasurable Immortal, the Dark Hall would&#x2019;ve gotten away with their schemes.</p><p>The people that controlled the stone army would not have been them. Instead, it would&#x2019;ve been the Dark Hall instead.</p><p>That was something that they did not dare to imagine.</p><p>&#x201C;We must announce the Immeasurable Immortal&#x2019;s identity to the world. We cannot allow him to exploit his identity to endanger others,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; The Elf King nodded. Then, he asked, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, what about the other matter?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The other matter is that we cannot continue to act this passively anymore.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We must find all of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s camps and eradicate them. We must start our counterattack,&#x201D; Chu Feng said in a serious manner.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
