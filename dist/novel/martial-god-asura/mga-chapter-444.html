<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 444 - Divine Body?</strong></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">The Fairy Spirit World World Spirit was indeed very powerful. Radiance swirled around her body and she seemed to be as holy as a saint. The golden-coloured glare of the sword endlessly danced in the air. Not only was it spectacular and eye-grabbing, the might of the attacks were exceptionally powerful as well.</span></p><p><span style="">But it was useless. Zhang Tianyi also had exceptional sword skills. While holding the Heaven power gold sword condensed by the Bow of Hundred Transformations, he had used only one hand to block the attacks of the Fairy Spirit World World Spirit.</span></p><p><span style="">Also, he was very quick. With the spin of his sword tip, he went from passive to aggressive and counterattacked the Fairy World Spirit. His sword techniques were unique and extremely overbearing. Very quickly, he continuously forced the Fairly Spirit World World Spirit back and dangers started to surround it.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eggy, lend your power to me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that, Chu Feng explosively yelled and Eggy also did not hesitate. She hurriedly lent her cultivation of the 9th level of the Profound realm to Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">After receiving Eggy&#x2019;s cultivation, in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes, golden-coloured lightning flashed and his aura rapidly rose. It infinitely neared the Heaven realm.</span></p><p><span style="">Quickly afterwards, blue-coloured lightning appeared and after the blue-coloured lightning appeared, it quickly interweaved with the golden-coloured lightning and formed a strange pattern on Chu Feng&#x2019;s pupils. At the same time, Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura had broke into the Heaven realm.</span></p><p><span style="">According to logic, with Chu Feng&#x2019;s lightning power and while borrowing Eggy&#x2019;s cultivation of the 9th level of the Profound realm, he should have totally been able to break into the 2nd level of the Heaven realm, but for some reason, he could only enter the 1st level of the Heaven realm while two lightnings overlaid.</span></p><p><span style="">Facing that phenomenon, Chu Feng and Eggy, and also Zi Ling, all contemplated it for a very long time. At the end, they guessed that it was very possibly because the binding of the Heaven realm was too big, In addition, it was power that Chu Feng&#x2019;s borrowed to use and it wasn&#x2019;t his own cultivation, so it weakened the power of the lightnings.</span></p><p><span style="">If Chu Feng personally entered the 9th level of the Profound realm, perhaps that binding would be broken through and he could rely on the two lightnings to step into the 2nd level of the Heaven realm.</span></p><p><span style="">Although it was only a guess, no matter what was said, even if he was in the 1st level of the Heaven realm, Chu Feng&#x2019;s power was also not comparable to before. Especially when he grasped the Elite Armament, Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power was already comparable to the 4th level of the Heaven realm.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">So, after Chu Feng raised his cultivation, he stepped on the Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens, held the Asura Ghost Axe, and attacked Zhang Tianyi.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* He abruptly waved the axe and a black-coloured blade of light came flying over. But Zhang Tianyi was still holding the Exquisite Chariot with one hand and he used the other hand to stop Chu Feng&#x2019;s black-coloured blade of light.</span></p><p><span style="">*bang* However, Zhang Tianyi underestimated the power of Chu Feng&#x2019;s Asura Ghost Axe. In the instant the two collided together, the Heaven power gold sword in Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s hand instantly cracked. It was unable to stop the might of the black-coloured blade of light and it shattered from stress.</span></p><p><span style="">But Zhang Tianyi was absolutely not an incapable ordinary person. Although he felt quite surprised, he did not panic too much. He leaped to the side and dodged Chu Feng&#x2019;s black-coloured blade of light.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, your Elite Armament is quite nice. I&#x2019;ll take it as well!&#x201D; After dodging Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack, Zhang Tianyi loudly laughed and rushed towards Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom boom boom boom* When Zhang Tianyi came up to Chu Feng, there was an extra wooden sword that had floating light swirling around it in his hand. The power of the wooden sword was extremely strong and it was only a bit weaker than Chu Feng&#x2019;s Asura Ghost Axe. It was the foundation treasure of the Sword God Valley, the Elite Armament Divine Wood Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">*dang dang dang dang*</span></p><p><span style="">Zhang Tianyi was already ridiculously powerful. With a casual condensation of a Heaven power gold sword, he could suppress a World Spirit from the Fairy Spirit World. Currently, while holding the Elite Armament, his strength greatly increased even more.</span></p><p><span style="">Symbols of light around the sword ceaselessly appeared. One wave overlaying another, they endlessly swept towards Chu Feng and even Chu Feng could only hold them back but without any power to counterattack. He was constantly forced back by Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s suppression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Zhang, you and I were originally from the same school. Right now, we should be combining our powers to fight against the outside. Why is there a need for infighting?&#x201D; In reality, Chu Feng did not use his full power because he truly didn&#x2019;t want to fight Zhang Tianyi to the death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, a mountain cannot hold two tigers. Do you not understand such simple logic?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, in the continent of the Nine Provinces, when I&#x2019;m mentioned, you would be thought of. People always mention and discuss you and me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But let me tell you. There can only be one strongest genius in the continent of the Nine Provinces. It is me, Zhang Tianyi.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And the only way to let them know that I&#x2019;m stronger than you. There is only one way, it is to kill you.&#x201D; Zhang Tianyi was extremely ruthless. Every single strike was fatal. He was truly aiming to take Chu Feng&#x2019;s life.</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing those words, a cold glare also flashed in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes as he coldly said, &#x201C;Since it is like so, Senior Zhang, you cannot blame me for ignoring the feelings of camaraderie.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, faint green-coloured armor of radiance suddenly appeared on Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. Coincidently, white-coloured fog also surrounded him and appeared, instantly enveloping Zhang Tianyi within.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is? Illusion Formation!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, the thing that caused Chu Feng to be speechless was that even though Zhang Tianyi wasn&#x2019;t a World Spiritist, his reactions were very sharp and his will was extremely firm.</span></p><p><span style="">He had actually instantly saw what Chu Feng used was an Illusion Formation and wasn&#x2019;t deceived by it. The Divine Wood Sword in his hand shot out light in all directions and layers of even fiercer attacks started exploding out and endlessly pressed towards Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit! How is he able to break open my Illusion Formation?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Chu Feng tightly furrowed his brows. Facing Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s attacks that were getting fiercer and fiercer, the current him was indeed unable to hold them back. He hurriedly used the Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens and wanted to evade them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Want to escape? Your Asura Ghost Axe is mine!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But what Chu Feng did not expect was as he used the Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens, two lines of blue-coloured flames rose from under Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s feet and his speed had actually immediately multiplied. Like a shadow, he came up to Chu Feng, and even his Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens was unable to get rid of him.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s attacks which dazzled eyes came at him head-on, even Chu Feng&#x2019;s complexion couldn&#x2019;t help but greatly changed because at that instant, he felt the threat of death.</span></p><p><span style="">Not only was Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s battle power extremely strong, the methods he grasped was no weaker than his. He was simply the most terrifying opponent Chu Feng had ever met in his life within the young generation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">In the moment of life and death, Zi Ling appeared in front of Chu Feng like a ghost. At that instant, a purple-coloured aura surrounded Zi Ling&#x2019;s body. Although she was still in the 1st level of the Heaven realm, she was many times stronger than before.</span></p><p><span style="">Especially her purple-coloured huge bell. It already appeared from Zi Ling&#x2019;s offerings and with Divine Power, she pressed towards Zhang Tianyi.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You indeed grasp special methods, but you are still unable to block me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Facing Zi Ling who used her full strength, Zhang Tianyi was still not afraid. As he madly laughed, a blue-coloured aura appeared around his entire body. The blue-coloured aura surrounded him, and like armor, protected him within.</span></p><p><span style="">Quickly afterwards, the blue-coloured aura had actually rapidly changed and became blue-coloured flames. Correct, flames.</span></p><p><span style="">The scorching feeling did indeed belong to flames, without a doubt. They were like flames that could burn everything, and they were surging around Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">The blue-coloured flames were unable to injure him because the blue-coloured flames were originally one with him. They came out from inside his body. The most important thing was that as the blue-coloured flames appeared, Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s battle power had instantly rose again. The powerful feeling he gave off had already surpassed Zi Ling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This terrifying special power. It is possible that he is also a Divine Body?&#x201D; At that instant, Chu Feng and Zi Ling were both astonished because the special power of the blue-coloured flames was indeed extremely similar to Zi Ling&#x2019;s unique purple-coloured aura.</span></p><p><span style="">They were similarly powerful, they were similarly terrifying, they similarly had overwhelming battle power, and they similarly grasped extremely combat techniques. It simply corresponded infinitely with a Divine Body.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
