<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1119 - Overestimating Your Abilities</strong></p><p>After Bai Ruochen said those words, she immediately turned around and continued to go on her way.</p><p>However, Wang Yan, Yuan Qing and Jiang Hao felt as if a ten thousand catty sledgehammer appeared from the sky and smashed directly onto their heads. At this moment, their minds were completely blank, with only a single word echoing through them.</p><p>Scum, scum, scum, scum...</p><p>Scum? They believed themselves to be elegant and graceful geniuses, the object of admiration for many women, the object that many men bowed down to. Yet, they were actually being called scum by someone.</p><p>If it was said that Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s action before had shocked them, then the words spoken by her just now were something that they could not accept.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha, scum, so the three of you actually have such a nickname too.&#x201D; At this moment, Huang Juan was laughing in amusement. However, her laughter was truly vile, and even appeared to be adding fire.</p><p>Actually, at this very moment, the extremely conceited Wang Yan, Jiang Hao and Yuan Qing had all become angry. If it was another woman who called them scum, then not only would the three of them immediately curse back at her, they might even start to directly attack her and rape her.</p><p>However, the woman standing before them was Bai Ruochen. Although her words were extremely repulsive, just by looking at her beautiful back before them, the three of them were unable to urge themselves to do anything too excessive.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, get away from junior sister Bai Ruochen.&#x201D; Right at this moment, Yuan Qing suddenly shouted angrily. As he did not dare to do anything to Bai Ruochen, he shifted all of his rage onto Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh? Yuan Qing, you&#x2019;re actually still alive?&#x201D; To Yuan Qing&#x2019;s great surprise, Chu Feng suddenly said those words after he turned around.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Those words spoken by Chu Feng not only confused Yuan Qing, it also confused Wang Yan, Jiang Hao, Huang Juan and even Bai Ruochen.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re actually still alive?&#x2019; Was Chu Feng implying that Yuan Qing should be dead?</p><p>At this moment, only Chu Feng knew about the intention behind his words, as the person who had triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle was him, and not Yuan Qing.</p><p>For what reason did Chu Feng allow Yuan Qing to pretend so openly that it was he who had triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle?</p><p>It was because he was suspicious, and feared that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves would do something to the person who triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. Thus, he decided to allow Yuan Qing to continue on with his lie and take on the honor of being the person who had triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle for the time being. In short, Chu Feng wanted Yuan Qing to become his shield.</p><p>However, several months had passed since the triggering of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. Yet, Yuan Qing was still alive and kicking. This meant that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves did not do anything to Yuan Qing. Otherwise, with the methods of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, Yuan Qing ought to be dead already.</p><p>Thus, when Chu Feng saw Yuan Qing, he was actually secretly delighted. He felt that if the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves wanted to kill Yuan Qing, they would&#x2019;ve already done so. Since Yuan Qing was still alive, it meant that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves were willing to let him live.</p><p>Since Yuan Qing was fine, it meant that there was no need for him to continue on with the honorable title of the person who triggered the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle; it was time for Chu Feng to take back what was originally his. Thus, Chu Feng said. &#x201C;If I were you, I&#x2019;d be enjoying my current lifestyle to the fullest, instead of trying to stir up trouble everywhere and womanizing others.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What do you mean by that?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng not only did not answer his question, he instead said such unfathomable words, Yuan Qing became even more angry.</p><p>&#x201C;You will understand what I mean soon.&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly and then turned around. Intimately, he patted Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s shoulder and then, with a voice that was not loud, but was extremely clear to the ears of everyone present, said. &#x201C;Lil Sis Ruochen, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>When Chu Feng did this action and said those words, Yuan Qing, Wang Yan, Jiang Hao and even Huang Juan&#x2019;s expression changed. An indescribable expression appeared on their faces.</p><p>Actually, at this moment, even Bai Ruochen was frowning. However, she did not say anything. Instead, she sped up her movement and used a movement martial skill to rapidly disappear from everyone&#x2019;s line of sight.</p><p>After Bai Ruochen left, Chu Feng turned around and displayed a provocative and disdainful smile to Yuan Qing. &#x201C;Treasure what is before your eyes. Your happy days will not last for much longer.&#x201D; After saying those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body moved, and he rapidly chased after Bai Ruochen.</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Qing, Wang Yan and Jiang Hao&#x2019;s lungs were about to explode, and their intestines were about to break from rage.</p><p>The goddess of their hearts, Bai Ruochen, had called them scum and was unwilling to even speak with them.</p><p>Yet, that trash disciple from the Southern Cyanwood Forest not only called Bai Ruochen &#x2018;Lil Sis,&#x2019; he even dared to touch Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s sacred body with his filthy hand.</p><p>Most importantly, Bai Ruochen did not actually display an antipathic expression or any unwillingness toward Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions. It was as if she was accepting them. Could it be that this Bai Ruochen was together with that trash Chu Feng?</p><p>When they thought of this point, the three of them did not dare to think any further. One by one, they clenched their firsts. The urge to chop Chu Feng into eight pieces, skinning him and pulling his tendons out, appeared in their hearts.</p><p>&#x201C;This guy by the name of Chu Feng is truly deserving of death.&#x201D; In extreme anger, Yuan Qing, Wang Yan and Jiang Hao said those words simultaneously.</p><p>&#x201C;What, could it be that the three of you are feeling jealous?&#x201D; Seeing this, Huang Juan laughed and added oil to fire.</p><p>&#x201C;Jealous? How could he be worthy of our jealousy?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the angry expression on Yuan Qing, Wang Yan and Jiang Hao&#x2019;s faces became even more pronounced.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh yoh yoh, why are you all acting this angry toward me? It&#x2019;s not me who called you three scum. If you have the skill, then go and find that Bai Ruochen.&#x201D; Huang Juan cast a side-eye at the three of them. After that, she flew away.</p><p>However, before she left, she said. &#x201C;However, I feel that Chu Feng is pretty extraordinary. Just by the fact at how unafraid he is, and his attitude of not putting any of you in his eyes, I know that guy possesses some skills.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I advise the three of you to not go and provoke him, because the most frightening thing you can do, is to provoke someone you don&apos;t know.&#x201D; After saying those words, Huang Juan left.</p><p>However, Huang Juan&#x2019;s advice was not taken to heart by Yuan Qing, Wang Yan or Jiang Hao at all. That was because the three of them didn&#x2019;t believe Chu Feng to be powerful at all. Instead, they felt that he was useless trash.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Yuan Qing, we have countless opportunities to take care of that Chu Feng after we enter the Cyanwood Mountain. What we should do now is to use the time to search for the flags. As we do not know where the flags are hidden, it is better that we operate separately to search for them. I shall be taking my leave first.&#x201D; Wang Yan cupped his fist respectfully and then left.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Yuan Qing, take care.&#x201D; Immediately after Wang Yan left, Jiang Hao also left.</p><p>At this moment, only Yuan Qing remained. The angry expression in his eyes was not reduced in the slightest. His eyes were fixed onto the direction that Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen left in. Suddenly, his body moved; he began to follow Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.</p><p>Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were flying alongside one another. Due to the fact that the two of them had to inspect practically every stone before their path, their flying speed was not very fast.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that an ingrate is following us.&#x201D; Suddenly, Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s beautiful eyebrows frowned slightly. A displeased expression appeared on her pretty little face.</p><p>&#x201C;Go on before me. Proceed toward the depths. Take this with you, I will go and find you later.&#x201D; Chu Feng handed Bai Ruochen a talisman paper with symbols imprinted on it. This was a Tracking Talisman. Carrying it, Chu Feng was able to tell where Bai Ruochen was and easily follow after her.</p><p>&#x201C;Do not be too excessive. Just so-so will do. After all, we are in the territory of the Cyanwood Mountain.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen seemed to understand what Chu Feng&#x2019;s intention was. She received the Tracking Talisman and continued to proceed onward. Soon, she disappeared into the distant stone forest.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng turned his head around. As he sensed the aura that was approaching him, a strange smile appeared on his face. &#x201C;Overestimating your abilities and courting death.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
