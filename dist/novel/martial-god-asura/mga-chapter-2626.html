As long as you obtain that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, you will be able to curb his Evil God Sword. With his abilities, how could he possibly contend against you then?&#x201D; That old man said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Demon Armament Suppression Talisman?

His expression changed slightly. Then, he asked, &#x201C;Although this lowly one is slow-witted, I am still able to tell that the Demon Armament Chu Feng possessed is most definitely not an ordinary item. As such, how could the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief possess a treasure capable of curbing that Demon Armament?&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;He would naturally not be able to possess such a treasure.

Upon receiving the stone, the Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s Sectmaster respectfully bid his farewell to the old man and then left immediately. He proceeded to the location written on the stone.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew very well that he was only able to defeat Ying Mingchao because of that Incomplete Immortal Armament.

Those that originally did not meddle with things in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm all started to involve themselves because of that Chu Feng.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;But&#x2026; exactly who is it that gave them the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman?

It is orders from above that transferred away too many of our clansmen in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As we lack the manpower, we are unable to monitor things to a satisfactory degree. It is all within reason,&#x201D; The old man said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, the old man asked, &#x201C;Have all of our clan&#x2019;s younger generation that were sent to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm left?&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Senior, please rest assured. They have all left. After all, our clan has already canceled all missions in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.

We have no idea what sort of shenanigans the Infant Soul Sect is planning to get up to this time around. We must not allow our clan&#x2019;s younger generation to get involved in this matter. Else&#x2026; according to our clan&#x2019;s rules, even if they are to encounter danger, we must absolutely not act to save them,&#x201D; The old man said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Senior, we are not allowed to save them because they were tasked with missions. Now that all the missions are canceled, they are no longer tempering themselves in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Are we still not allowed to save them should something happen to them in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&#x201D; The middle-aged man asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Who said that all the missions were canceled?
