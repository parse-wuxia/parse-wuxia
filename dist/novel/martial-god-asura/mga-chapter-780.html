<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 780 - Follow His Instructions</strong></p><p><span style="">As they say: &#x201C;The amateurs watch the liveliness; the experts watch the skillfulness.&#x201D; The masses gazed at how majestic the Spirit Formations were, while Chu Feng observed the internal structures of these formations. Even though all three of them were laying an Opening Formation, Chu Feng could tell that the structures were completely different. They had their respective mysteriousness, and there was absolutely nothing similar.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Quick, they&#x2019;re starting! We must lay this formation in accordance with Xuan Xiaochao and the others!&#x201D; shouted Old Liu solemnly, deep underground.</span></p><p><span style="">Soon after, the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers started to nervously lay an Opening Formation that had absorbed a large amount of power from the Spirit Formation Stones.</span></p><p><span style="">When Chu Feng gazed at the formation that Xuan Xiaochao and the two others were laying, as well as at the one the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers were laying, he immediately understood everything. He muttered to himself with a light smile, &#x201C;I see.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng already knew that the Sealing Formation was supposed to be activated by the Four Protectors simultaneously, as well as the fact that they all took away a portion of the method to deactivate it. If they wanted to unseal that formation, they had to gather the four methods from the Four Protectors.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming held their respective Protector&#x2019;s methods and were unsealing the formation. As for the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, as Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s old subordinates, they clearly knew something. So, they were currently representing Qiu Canfeng and coordinating with Xuan Xiaochao and the others to unseal that Spirit Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom* Finally, Xuan Xiaochao and the others finished the formation. As it activated, three rays of light shot out, and into the boundless Spirit Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, ripples, like in water, endlessly spread from the center of the three rays of light atop the seemingly indestructible formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Powerful. Even such a powerful Spirit Formation can be deactivated?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, I heard that the </span><i><span style="">true</span></i><span style=""> Depraved Ravine is within this Spirit Formation! Can we finally see the actual remnants of the Crippling Night Demon Sect? This truly does raise one&#x2019;s expectations!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Impressive. As expected of the Three Protectors&#x2019; disciples. A technique like this really makes us feel ashamed and admirative!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, of course! They are the disciples of the Three Protectors, the representatives of the Eastern Sea Region&#x2019;s younger generation! In the future, the Eastern Sea Region will be their world!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When they gaze upon such a scene, the surrounding people starting getting excited. They all felt that this trip was worth it, that it was not a waste to risk their lives and come here, that they didn&#x2019;t wait so many days for naught.</span></p><p><span style="">However, as the people outside rose in excitement, and were even jumping and cheering, deep underground, in front of the fourth Opening Formation no one knew about, the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers were tightly furrowing their brows.</span></p><p><span style="">They did so because the deactivation effect of the fourth formation wasn&#x2019;t working. There seemed to be some issue.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait, I think there&#x2019;s something wrong here. This formation is not activating,&#x201D; said one.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should we do? The power of these Spirit Formation Stones can last only a single hour. All of them have been used, and if we don&#x2019;t hurry up, all the effort we put into this will be wasted.&#x201D; In reality, everyone else was extremely worried as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Big Brother, what should we do?&#x201D; As they had no clue what their next course of action would be, everyone cast their gazes at the head of the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, Old Liu.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; He too was in a very troubled situation, because he didn&#x2019;t know what to do either.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Liu, how about this here? It should allow this Opening Formation to activate.&#x201D; Just at that moment, Chu Feng spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">When they looked in Chu Feng&#x2019;s direction, all of them couldn&#x2019;t help being taken aback. Some were even shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">Before Chu Feng was a Spirit Formation Diagram he drew. It was an alteration of Old Liu and the others&#x2019; Opening Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Insolence! All ten of them are the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s elites in Spirit Formation techniques! Who do you think you are to doubt the formation they laid? If they change it according to your diagram, this formation will be ruined!&#x201D; shouted a middle-aged man as he pointed at Chu Feng. He had a very horrible attitude.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. I&#x2019;ve suspected that he may be a spy sent by the Immortal Execution Archipelago. It looks that I&#x2019;m correct. He wants to destroy our plan, and now, his true appearance is revealed!&#x201D; said another rather young Martial Lord. Soon after, several more people spoke&#x2014;they were all who felt displeased at Chu Feng from the very start. Finally, they found a chance to take care of Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah, words cannot be spoken like so. I feel that Wuqing has kind intentions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Besides, what is the plan of the Crippling Night Demon Sect? And what is the plan of the Immortal Execution Archipelago? They want the thing inside the Depraved Ravine.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, they have hid themselves within the crowd, impatiently waiting for Xuan Xiaochao and the others to open this formation. They are more impatient than anyone else. Why would they want to think of obstructions to stop us from unsealing this formation?&#x201D; But soon, someone stood out and spoke for Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, those who were slandering Chu Feng were speechless. As they could do nothing else, they could only say, &#x201C;Even so, he cannot doubt all ten of them. They are Gold-cloak World Spiritists, while he is at most a Purple-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The difference between their Spirit Formation techniques is millions of miles. What are his suspicions based on? This is simply mocking them&#x2014;a provocation to the Crippling Night Demon Sect!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Those who wanted to support Chu Feng now didn&#x2019;t know what to say either. So, they could only reply with, &#x201C;Wuqing, we&#x2019;ve accepted your kind intentions with our hearts. However, this is not a small matter, so it might be better if you don&#x2019;t interfere.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Seniors, I, Wuqing, am not making trouble here, nor am I overestimating myself. However, if you follow my words, it will definitely activate this Opening Formation,&#x201D; said Chu Feng confidently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shut up, you. A person like yourself dares to speak such boastful words? If it fails after following your instruction, can you bear that responsibility? It would be useless even if we kill you a hundred times,&#x201D; retorted the person that was annoyed with Chu Feng, in a furious manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t follow what I say to do, would you have a solution? Can you avoid failure? Can you change the present situation?&#x201D; Chu Feng fiercely returned a question without any wavering in his expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; That person was out of words; he didn&#x2019;t know how to refute. The formation was really too complicated. He simply did not understand it. Even the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers didn&#x2019;t know what to do, so how should he know?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Raise your head, and look. Look at Xuan Xiaochao&#x2019;s, Fu Fengming&#x2019;s, and You Tonghan&#x2019;s expression.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;See how much they hope you succeed. See what kind of pressure they are currently enduring.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you fail&#x2014;no one will know it was your fault&#x2026; because everyone will think it was </span><i><span style="">their</span></i><span style=""> fault. At that moment, they can use their faces to sweep the ground of their shame.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who do the three of them represent? The Three Protectors. Who do the Three Protectors represent? The Crippling Night Demon Sect. At a moment like that, who everyone will mock are not only them&#x2014;it is everyone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Can </span><i><span style="">you</span></i><span style=""> bear such a responsibility?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How about you?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Which one of you can?&#x201D; Chu Feng loudly questioned those who defamed him before, his attitude extremely strong and firm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The ones who furiously retorted Chu Feng before had ashen faces. They backed away in fright as they heard Chu Feng&#x2019;s questioning, and didn&#x2019;t know how to reply. They were in a very difficult situation.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Old Liu was currently doing what Chu Feng said&#x2014;raising his head, and looking. When he saw the near undetectable uneasiness on the faces of Xuan Xiaochao, Fu Fengming, and You Tonghan, he finally ordered, &#x201C;Follow Wuqing&#x2019;s instructions and change the formation.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
