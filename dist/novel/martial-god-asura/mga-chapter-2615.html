However, it remained that Zi Xunyi was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Thus, just from Chu Feng&#x2019;s descriptions of the spirit formation, she was able to make out of what it did.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, Chu Feng began to secretly set up the spirit formation together with Zi Xunyi. As for why they had to do it secretly, it was naturally because they did not want others to discover it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the allied army had already fallen apart.

Fortunately, the spirit formation techniques that Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi possessed were extremely powerful. Thus, even though it would be more difficult to quietly set up a spirit formation within their bodies, the two of them would only each have to set up half of the spirit formation should they jointly set it up. Thus, as long as they were given a sufficient amount of time, they would be able to finish setting up that spirit formation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi were extremely worried by the stalemate between Ying Mingchao and the Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s Sectmaster, those people whose eyes were blinded by greed, those people that wished to obtain martial comprehension from that Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s grand formation, were secretly delighted.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the beginning when Ying Mingchao began to fight against the Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s Sectmaster, they were all afraid, afraid that Ying Mingchao would be able to easily kill the Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s Sectmaster. After all, Ying Mingchao was the publicly-accepted number one expert in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, judging from the situation now, the two of them were actually equally matched. Furthermore, the Buddha&#x2019;s Heavenly Temple&#x2019;s Abbot and the Immortal Sword School&#x2019;s Headmaster were not planning to join the battle. Thus, the greedy crowd grew much more at ease.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a beast-like roar suddenly sounded from Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment when that roar was heard, the image of a ferocious beast appeared in the sky.
