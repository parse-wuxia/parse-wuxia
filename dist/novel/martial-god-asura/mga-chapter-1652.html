<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1652 - Seizing Items</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Ahh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Tianhu roared angrily. Then, holding the Cyan Rainbow Sword, he hacked at Chu Feng.</p><p>In an instant, a cyan blade ray sliced through heaven and earth.</p><p>Based on the might of his attack, Nangong Tianhu was indeed more ferocious than Nangong Tianshi. After all, at this moment, Nangong Tianhu did not have any sense of cowardice at all. All he possessed was overflowing killing intent.</p><p>Thus, the Cyan Rainbow Sword in his hand was many times sharper and more powerful than the Purple Rainbow Sword in Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>However, faced with the ferocious attack from Nangong Tianhu, Chu Feng actually stood there motionlessly. He was allowing the Cyan Rainbow Sword to continue to unleash fatal slashes toward him without dodging at all.</p><p>It was not because Chu Feng possessed a deathwish. Merely, Chu Feng did not expect that his battle power would increase to such a degree after using the Four Great Secret Skills.</p><p>With the combined protection of the Four Great Secret Skills, even if Nangong Tianhu were brandishing the Cyan Rainbow Sword, he would not be able to harm Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard, I refuse to believe that I cannot injure you!&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Tianhu was so enraged by Chu Feng that he was nearly driven mad. The reason for that was because Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions were simply an enormous humiliation to him.</p><p>He was unable to endure such humiliation from Chu Feng. In fury, he arrived before Chu Feng, and wanted to use the divine might of his Cyan Rainbow Sword to slice through Chu Feng&#x2019;s defense.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at the moment when the Cyan Rainbow Sword was hacked toward Chu Feng, an enormous White Tiger claw suddenly appeared and grabbed the incoming Cyan Rainbow Sword.</p><p>After the Cyan Rainbow Sword ended up being grabbed by the White Tiger claw, it was unable to break free. No matter how hard Nangong Tianhu tried, he was unable to pull the Cyan Rainbow Sword back out. It was as if the Cyan Rainbow Sword had already been embedded into the White Tiger claw.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; At this moment, Nangong Tianhu&#x2019;s expression changed enormously. After struggling, he became aware of how bad the situation was. Chu Feng was much more powerful than he had anticipated.</p><p>Facing Nangong Tianhu&#x2019;s frightened expression, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he said, &#x201C;I am not boasting here. Unless you possess the cultivation of a rank five Half Martial Emperor, forget about injuring me in the slightest.&#x201D;</p><p>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng took the initiative to attack. He shot forth many fists. &#x201C;Bang, bang, bang&#x2026;&#x201D; A series of muffled sounds. His fist strikes landed firmly onto Nangong Tianhu&#x2019;s body. After the series of fist strikes ended, Nangong Tianhu, like his younger brother, lost consciousness and fell ruthlessly to the ground. He was no longer able to continue fighting.</p><p>As for the Cyan Rainbow Sword that he possessed, like his younger brother&#x2019;s Purple Rainbow Sword, it had also ended up in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow! Big brother Chu Feng, you&#x2019;re amazing! The two of them were actually no match for you, even when joining hands. Furthermore, they both possess a cultivation one level above yours.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, exactly how powerful are you? I have simply never met someone as powerful as you are.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Our clan says that Moli is a genius. However, when Moli sees big brother Chu Feng, she really feels very inferior.&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Moli ran over while cheering excitedly. While Chu Feng had placed a defensive spirit formation around her to protect her, his spirit formation did not restrict her freedom. Thus, she was naturally able to move about.</p><p>&#x201C;Moli, you&#x2019;re being corrupted by bad examples; you&#x2019;ve actually started to joke around with your big brother Chu Feng,&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly flicked Nangong Moli&#x2019;s little forehead. Then, he began to fiddle with the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword. They were two Incomplete Imperial Armaments. Furthermore, they both possessed quality superior to Tantai Xue&#x2019;s Talismanic Soul Stealing Flute. Chu Feng was truly in love with them.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, those two Incomplete Imperial Armaments are both top quality items. Reportedly, back then, Grandmaster Rainbow used all that he had learned, and all of the resources that he had obtained in his life to refine seven Incomplete Imperial Armaments. Those seven Incomplete Imperial Armaments are collectively known as the Seven Rainbow Swords. They are the seven best weapons refined by Grandmaster Rainbow in his lifetime,&#x201D; Nangong Moli said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little girl, you know quite a bit. In that case, do you know how the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword ended up in your Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s hands?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course I do. It was not long after our Lord Clan Chief became our Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s new clan chief. At that time, he opened up an Emperor&#x2019;s Tomb alongside the Beitang Imperial Clan. From that Emperor&#x2019;s Tomb, they discovered the Seven Rainbow Swords. Among them, three became possessions of our Nangong Imperial Clan, and three became possessions of the Beitang Imperial Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, Lord Clan Chief did not bestow those three swords that we had obtained to his subordinates who had opened up the Emperor&#x2019;s Tomb together with him and the Beitang Imperial Clan that day. Rather, he kept them for himself. Never would I have expected that he would actually give them to his children. It would appear that he is truly selfish.&#x201D;</p><p>Speaking of this matter, Nangong Moli began to pout. It would seem that her impression of her Lord Clan Chief had become rather bad.</p><p>&#x201C;Seven Rainbow Swords, shouldn&#x2019;t there be seven swords? Both the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan came to possess three swords. What happened to the last one? Where did it go?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;It is not that easy to open an Emperor&#x2019;s Tomb. They invited a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist to help them open the Emperor&#x2019;s Tomb. The best sword among the seven swords was given to that world spiritist,&#x201D; said Nangong Moli.</p><p>&#x201C;That Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist must be one of the Ten Immortals, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, it&#x2019;s the Ten Immortal&#x2019;s Avaricious Immortal,&#x201D; Nangong Moli said.</p><p>&#x201C;Avaricious Immortal, why would there be such a name?&#x201D; Chu Feng was astonished. The term &#x2018;avaricious&#x2019; didn&#x2019;t appear to be fitting for an Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s extremely money-grubbing, and values money and wealth as much as his own life. That was why he was known as the Avaricious Immortal. That&#x2019;s what I guessed, at least, hehe&#x2026;&#x201D; Nangong Moli said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh you,&#x201D; Chu Feng was amused by Nangong Moli. Then, he looked to Nangong Tianshi and Nangong Tianhu on the ground and said, &#x201C;How was it? Did it manage to calm your anger? If you think that giving them a beating is not enough, I&#x2019;ll kill them for you.&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Chu Feng loathed Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi, and was itching to kill them, it remained that they were Nangong Moli&#x2019;s older brothers. Thus, he must first obtain permission from Nangong Moli to kill them.</p><p>If Nangong Moli did not wish for them to die, Chu Feng would naturally not kill them. After all, no matter what, they were still the sons of the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget about it. I am not a narrow-minded person. Let&#x2019;s spare their lives,&#x201D; Nangong Moli laughed mischievously. Then, she said, &#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, that Cyan Rainbow Sword and that Purple Rainbow Sword are treasures. You couldn&#x2019;t possibly be thinking about returning them, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course not. I am already being extremely forgiving by not killing them. How could I possibly return the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword to them? Furthermore, these two swords are a waste in their hands. It would be wronging the two swords.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Likely, if Grandmaster Rainbow were to learn about this matter in the underworld, he would also not be happy about it. Thus, it&#x2019;s better that I take care of the Cyan Rainbow Sword and Purple Rainbow Sword instead,&#x201D; Chu Feng did not even possess an actual Incomplete Imperial Armament weapon. And now, he had suddenly obtained two. How could he possibly return them?</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, I don&#x2019;t think you should return them either. In that case, big brother Chu Feng, you should seize those two weapons for yourself. Are you able to have both swords approve of you as their master? If it were other ordinary people, they would definitely not be able to do it. However, I think you might be able to.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Quickly, give it a try. Moli really wants to see,&#x201D; Nangong Moli opened her eyes widely and spoke with an expression of anticipation.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t do it. The Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword were not conquered by Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi themselves. They received the help of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Thus, the connection between them is not that easy to sever. I will require a certain amount of time to sever the connection.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, I am only able to attempt to have these two weapons recognize me as their masters after severing the connection between them,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
