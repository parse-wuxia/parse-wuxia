<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1499 - Look Carefully At Me</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Wuuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, being tormented by that sort of unbearable pain, Crazed Killer Tuoba was covered with sweat and shivering nonstop. His two legs had grown weak and he appeared to be on the verge of kneeling.</p><p>At this time, he had truly experienced the enormous gap in strength between him and Hong Qiang. This gap was not something that could be made up with external strength.</p><p>Even though he was a rank seven Half Martial Emperor and the head of the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Punishment Department, he would still collapse at the first blow from Hong Qiang. Not to mention blocking Hong Qiang&#x2019;s attack, he was unable to even withstand the pain caused by Hong Qiang&#x2019;s attack.</p><p>The pain was so tormenting that it was on the verge of taking away Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s life.</p><p>However, Hong Qiang did not feel the slightest bit of compassion for Crazed Killer Tuoba. A flash of coldness shone through his eyes as Hong Qiang asked Chu Feng, &#x201C;Chu Feng, how do you want him to die?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, although Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s conduct should be met with death, he is, after all, the head of the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Punishment Department. I think it would be better to hand him over to Lord Headmaster to handle,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Dugu Xingfeng&#x2019;s relationship with this fellow is somewhat special. If we were to hand him to Dugu Xingfeng, I fear that Dugu Xingfeng might be soft and lenient.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The way I see it, there is no need for you to worry about all that. We should carry on what we have started and kill him. Furthermore, no one will know that it was us who killed him,&#x201D; The killing intent in Hong Qiang&#x2019;s eyes grew more and more dense.</p><p>&#x201C;Hong Qiang, you dare?! Do you know that&#x2026; I, Crazed Killer Tuoba, am not only the head of the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Punishment Department, I am also the next headmaster.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Headmaster has said that he will be abdicating in a short while and that I will be the one to become the next headmaster of the Cyanwood Mountain. Furthermore, this is something that is already determined.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you dare to kill me, it will be equivalent to becoming enemies with the Cyanwood Mountain. They will definitely not let you get away.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, if you think you can kill me in secrecy, you are greatly mistaken.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is a tracking imprint on my body. With how short of a distance we are from the Cyanwood Mountain, the tracking will be extremely clear. If something were to happen to me, Lord Headmaster will definitely know about it, the Cyanwood Mountain will definitely know about it. They will know that it was you and Chu Feng who killed me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Come, kill me! If you dare to kill me, the Cyanwood Mountain will definitely not let you two get away. Did you really think that you could do whatever you wished just because you&#x2019;re a peak Half Martial Emperor? You must know that our Cyanwood Mountain is protected by Martial Emperors. Before Martial Emperors, you are nothing!&#x201D; The pain Crazed Killer Tuoba was experiencing was lessened slightly. This allowed him to become fierce once again. Surprisingly, he actually began to threaten Hong Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you think that I, Hong Qiang, am someone who grew up in fear?&#x201D; Hong Qiang did not believe what Crazed Killer Tuoba said.</p><p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t believe me, then look at this!&#x201D; As Crazed Killer Tuoba spoke, he grabbed with his hand and pulled away the clothes he wore.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng and Hong Qiang discovered that there was indeed a tracking imprint on Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s dantian area. Furthermore, that tracking imprint was even glimmering strangely.</p><p>&#x201C;This tracking imprint is something that the people from the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly set up.&#x201D; Chu Feng started to frown. With the spirit formation techniques that he had grasped now, he was able to tell with a single glance that Crazed Killer Tuoba was not lying.</p><p>This tracking imprint was truly not simple. Right now, nothing major had happened to Crazed Killer Tuoba. Thus, this tracking imprint would not do anything.</p><p>However, if Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s life were in danger, this tracking imprint would signal designated people. Not only would it inform them of the place where Crazed Killer Tuoba was killed, it would likely even transmit the final dialogue that Crazed Killer Tuoba had before his death to them.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng said that this tracking imprint had been set up by the people from the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly was because this tracking formation was extremely remarkable. Even someone like Hong Qiang would not be able to set up such a tracking imprint. It was likely that this tracking imprint was something that had been set on Crazed Killer Tuoba by a Martial Emperor-level expert from the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, it&#x2019;s no wonder that you, brat, have obtained the good graces of so many people. It turns out that you&#x2019;re quite extraordinary indeed. At the very least, your eyesight is pretty good. You actually managed to recognize the origin of this tracking imprint.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, truth be told, this tracking imprint is something that Lord Headmaster requested Lord Assembly Master to set up on me. If something is to happen to me, both Lord Headmaster and Lord Assembly Master will know about it. The two of you will not be able to escape far before they catch up to you and kill you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you should now know how important I, Crazed Killer Tuoba, am now, right? You wish to kill me? You should measure yourself first!&#x201D; Crazed Killer Tuoba said mockingly.</p><p>&#x201C;Crazed Killer Tuoba, while it is true that we cannot kill you, we can bring you to Lord Headmaster and explain what has happened. At that time, you will still not be able to escape death,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng. Do you truly think that just because Lord Headmaster has spoken good words to you, that he truly values you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I might as well tell you the truth. Lord Headmaster is only using you. You are nothing more than a chess piece. A mere disciple like you, how could you possibly be able to compare to me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not to mention that Lord Headmaster will not trust your words, even if he did, he will still not kill me. In the end, the one that&#x2019;ll be out of luck will be you. You want to fight against me? No, you don&#x2019;t have the ability to do so.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; Crazed Killer Tuoba suddenly laughed. His laughter was abnormally loud, abnormally arrogant.</p><p>At this moment, Hong Qiang was so enraged that he started to tightly clench his fists. He truly wished to smash Crazed Killer Tuoba to death with a palm strike. However, he could not do that. That was because he knew that if he were to kill Crazed Killer Tuoba like this, while he might be fine, he would end up creating a disaster for Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you all doing?&#x201D; Right at this moment, a voice sounded from a thousand meters away. Turning his gaze toward the voice, Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s expression instantly changed. Earlier, he had been extremely arrogant. However, this time around, it was as if he had eaten feces; he was no longer able to continue to laugh.</p><p>A thousand meters away, there was a person that was flying toward them. As for this person, it was none other than the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s headmaster, Dugu Xingfeng.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Headmaster, you must uphold justice for this subordinate,&#x201D; Suddenly, Crazed Killer Tuoba screamed miserably and then immediately rushed over to Dugu Xingfeng. He took the initiative to start an accusation first.</p><p>&#x201C;Crazed Killer, what happened? Do not panic, tell me from the beginning,&#x201D; Dugu Xingfeng asked calmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Headmaster, it&#x2019;s Chu Feng. That Chu Feng is truly a disgrace. He actually joined hands with that Hong Qiang so that they could kill me. If it wasn&#x2019;t for Lord Headmaster&#x2019;s prompt arrival, this subordinate would have been killed here,&#x201D; Crazed Killer Tuoba said with an expression of grievance all across his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? Chu Feng wanted to kill you? Why would he want to kill you? Furthermore, why are you in this place?&#x201D; Dugu Xingfeng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That child has harbored hard feelings for me the entire time and has long since wanted to take my life. This subordinate is here because he has been deceived by that Chu Feng,&#x201D; Crazed Killer Tuoba blurted out his lies without even thinking. It was as if he was speaking the truth.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; At this moment, Dugu Xingfeng nodded. Then, a light smiled appeared on his face. After that, he turned to Crazed Killer Tuoba, &#x201C;Crazed Killer, carefully look at me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Headmaster, wh, what do you want me to look at?&#x201D; Crazed Killer Tuoba was puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you see me as someone that is that easily deceived?&#x201D; Dugu Xingfeng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Crazed Killer Tuoba was unable to say anything. His complexion had once again turned ashen.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, Dugu Xingfeng&#x2019;s expression turned cold. He raised his foot, and with a &#x2018;bang,&#x2019; it landed on Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s body. Crazed Killer Tuoba was kicked several miles away.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
