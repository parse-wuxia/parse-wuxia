<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 460 - Within Danger</strong></p><p><span style="">Other than the Han Province, the Spirit Province was the most prosperous province in the continent of the Nine Provinces.</span></p><p><span style="">Not to mention that there were a lot more powerful people here than in the other provinces, the citizens here passed their days a lot wealthier and a lot more free.</span></p><p><span style="">But right now, the Spirit Province that other provinces yearned for had already become a huge battlefield with unwatchable misery and traces of war flying everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">The Jie clan joined up with the Yuangang School, Hidden White Sect, Free and Unrestrained Valley, and Fire God School, the four big powers, and attacked the World Spirit Guild together, causing the biggest-scale war in a hundred years on the continent of the Nine Provinces to break out.</span></p><p><span style="">The war almost spread throughout all areas of the Spirit Province as conflicts endlessly happened with the World Spirit Guild against the Jie clan and the other powers.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time they were determining victory and defeat, the ones who suffered the most were naturally the innocent commoners. The might of the experts&#x2019; strikes were frightening, and intentional or not, they would always drag down the people with no cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="">Facing the war that could affect the structure of the powers in the continent of the Nine Provinces, the overlord of the Nine Provinces, the Jiang Dynasty, didn&#x2019;t interfere.</span></p><p><span style="">It was as if that battle was unrelated to them. They only silently stayed in the Han Province, coldly observed from the side, and there was no indication that they would do anything.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, the battle was still equal. Although the Jie clan joined up with the four big powers, after all, the World Spirit Guild wasn&#x2019;t weak.</span></p><p><span style="">But it was useless. The old ancestor of the Jie clan, the exceptional genius who shocked the continent a hundred years ago, had actually come out, and his cultivation reached the 7th level of the Heaven realm.</span></p><p><span style="">With his unstoppable might of the 7th level of the Heaven realm, he led the elite army of one million and swept through the World Spirit Guild.</span></p><p><span style="">The current World Spirit Guild was already backing away one step at a time and forced back into their nest. They opened up their strongest Spirit Formation to hold the army of the Jie clan back.</span></p><p><span style="">But it could do nothing as the old ancestor of the Jie clan was not a simple character. With his Spirit Formation methods, no matter how much stronger the Spirit Formation of the World Spirit Guild was, it was only a matter of time before it broke open.</span></p><p><span style="">At such a crucial time of life and death, the old ancestor of the World Spirit Guild was still unable to come out, and that caused people from the World Spirit Guild to sink into uneasiness.</span></p><p><span style="">As they faced a dangerous situation where it was unknown whether one would live or die, they resolutely used special methods and sent out the most outstanding people of the World Spirit Guild&#x2019;s young generation away the World Spirit Guild&#x2019;s base, and wanted to let them secretly leave.</span></p><p><span style="">At least if they survived, the World Spirit Guild would still have a chance to flip the situation. If even the young generation died, then the World Spirit Guild was truly going to be exterminated.</span></p><p><span style="">But it was useless. The World Spirit Guild still underestimated the Jie clan. The Jie clan already had former preparations. As they were concentrating on breaking open the Spirit Formation, they also sent people to guard in various areas outside of the World Spirit Guild&#x2019;s base.</span></p><p><span style="">So, shortly after the young generation of the World Spirit Guild left the World Spirit Guild&#x2019;s base, they met the army of the Fire God School, Hidden White Sect, Free and Unrestrained Valley, and Yuangang School. They forced the young generation of the World Spirit Guild into an impasse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Head of the Yuangang School, head of the Fire God School, head of the Hidden White Sect, and head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley. There is no enmity between my World Spirit Guild and you. Why must you be so pressing?&#x201D; At that moment, the face of the vice-head of the World Spirit Guild was a bit pale. On his ragged clothes, there were some traces of blood. He clearly experienced a hard battle.</span></p><p><span style="">And behind him was Xu Zhongyu, Gu Bo, and the other exceptional people in the World Spirit Guild&#x2019;s young generation. There were not many people, less than one hundred, but those people were the geniuses carefully picked by the World Spirit Guild so absolutely no accidents could happen to them.</span></p><p><span style="">But it was useless. Facing four heads, even if it was the vice-head of the World Spirit Guild, an outstanding Blue-cloak World Spiritist, he was unable to defeat them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, Vice-head Gao, at this time, we no longer need to talk in circles with you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The reason why we came here is not to catch Chu Feng. It&#x2019;s to exterminate your World Spirit Guild. You ask us the reason? The reason is because we don&#x2019;t like your World Spirit Guild. Coincidentally, with large sums of money, the Jie clan wants us to help them exterminate all of you. So, we came. Do you understand if I say it like that?&#x201D; The head of the Fire God School loudly laughed and said.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the three others also similarly laughed. Before, they were very afraid of the World Spirit Guild and many times, they were pulled by the nose, but didn&#x2019;t dare to say anything. Right now, they were finally able to not fear them and refreshingly fight the people from the World Spirit Guild. Naturally, it made them feel refreshed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;School Heads, don&#x2019;t waste your breath with them. Quickly decapitate them, take their heads, then report back. My chief will definitely reward you heavily.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that time, a young man within the crowd spoke. That man was none other than the future chief of the Jie clan, Jie Qingming.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jie Qingming, if you dare to, fight me one-on-one! What are you even capable of if you ask for help from outsiders?&#x201D; Xu Zhongyu furiously bellowed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. Xu Zhongyu, don&#x2019;t be naive anymore. You want to fight me one-on-one? Can you win?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We have fought for so many years and always, the outcome of the battle was never able to be decided. You and I are both clear that we cannot win against one another.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Also, </span><i><span style="">this</span></i><span style=""> is the real battle. My Jie clan only wants the result of this victory, so there&#x2019;s no need to think about the process in the middle. Right now, the four heads can easily kill all of you. I, Jie Qingming, have no need to fight you one-on-one.&#x201D; Jie Qingming coldly smiled, then quickly after, looked at the four heads and said,</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Four heads, why aren&#x2019;t you making your moves? It would be fine if it&#x2019;s my chief, but if you don&#x2019;t hurry and my old ancestor gets angered, even I will get punished.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing the title of the Jie clan&#x2019;s old ancestor, the complexions of the four heads all changed. In these past few days, they had personally seen the scariness of the old ancestor.</span></p><p><span style="">Although their powers&#x2019; old ancestors weren&#x2019;t weak as well, and were all experts in the 6th level of the Heaven realm, only one level of cultivation away from the old ancestor of the Jie clan&#x2019;s 7th level of the Heaven realm, that single level of distance was really too big. The 7th level of the Heaven realm was truly far from being comparable to those in the 6th level of the Heaven realm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Vice-head Gao, if you have to blame something, you can only blame your inability as a person. At first, you looked down on everyone, so right now, you cannot blame us for being heartless on you.&#x201D; The four heads explosively shouted, then started their attacks at the World Spirit Guild&#x2019;s crowd.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you all!&#x201D; Seeing that, Vice-head Gao furiously bellowed, then burst out his power of the 5th level of the Heaven realm and fought against the four heads.</span></p><p><span style="">And as the several heads were fighting, the other experts from the four big powers and the Jie clan, under Jie Qingming&#x2019;s command, headed straight for Xu Zhongyu, Gu Bo, and the other people in the young generation, and started their attacks.</span></p><p><span style="">In that situation, the only person who could participate in the battle within the young generation was Xu Zhongyu himself. He held the Elite Armament fan, emanated the aura of the 2nd level of the Heaven realm, and he did indeed have the airs of an apical genius.</span></p><p><span style="">But it was useless since the one he faced was his archenemy, Jie Qingming, as well as the old generation experts from the four big powers and the Jie clan. So, very quickly, he was disadvantaged and entered danger.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
