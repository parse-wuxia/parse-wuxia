<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1656 - Forced Onto A Path To Death</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Young man, think this over carefully. I&#x2019;ll give you until the count of ten.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;One, two, three, four, five&#x2026;&#x201D; This monk was truly shameless. Immediately after he said those words, he started counting. He had not given Chu Feng any time to consider at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Take it,&#x201D; Chu Feng was forced into a state of helplessness. He had no choice but to take out the scroll and hand it to that monk.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, that&#x2019;s more like it. Young man, what you&#x2019;ve done is a sensible act. No matter how important heaven or earth might be, they are not as important as your life,&#x201D; said the monk with a vulgar laugh as he held onto the scroll.</p><p>&#x201C;You must know that woman, right? She has left behind an imprint on me. Could you remove it for me? Else, if she were to come and find me later, and I am unable to hand over the scroll to her, she will definitely kill me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Young man, I can tell that you are a man blessed by heavens. For the time being, you will not die. Thus, just rest assured. I&#x2019;m sure we&apos;ll meet again someday,&#x201D; When the monk&#x2019;s words reached Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears, he had long since disappeared.</p><p>He was truly extremely powerful. Chu Feng suspected that he was not only a Half Martial Emperor. Rather, he was likely a Martial Emperor.</p><p>However, that monk was extremely inhumane. Chu Feng felt that he would definitely be able to help him. Yet, he had refused to help him.</p><p>&#x201C;I am truly unfortunate today. What&#x2019;s with all these people I&#x2019;m encountering?!&#x201D; Chu Feng felt extremely helpless. The only bits of comfort he managed to find were in the Cyan Rainbow Sword and Purple Rainbow Sword he had obtained from Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi.</p><p>However, when he thought of those two swords, Chu Feng was truly confused by the actions of that monk. Since he knew that the scroll was with Chu Feng, he should have been able to see the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword that were placed in the same Cosmos Sack as the scroll.</p><p>Yet, he only wanted the scroll, and was not interested in anything else. Was it that he was not greedy for wealth, or was that scroll really so precious that its value greatly surpassed that all of Chu Feng&#x2019;s other treasures?</p><p>Even though the monk had not robbed Chu Feng of all his treasures and had not killed him, Chu Feng still hated that monk very much. After all, the fact that the monk had robbed him of the scroll meant that the monk had forced him onto a path to death.</p><p>In any case, Chu Feng had decided that he could not continue to stay here. Chu Feng carefully inspected the city to determine the people who posed a threat to him.</p><p>Then, he changed back into his original appearance, arrived before the city gates, publicly took out the naked Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshu from his burlap sack and hung them upside down on top of the city walls.</p><p>Furthermore, in front of everyone, he used a very large crimson writing brush to write eight large characters on Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s naked bodies: &#x2018;Defeated by Chu Feng, this is the result.&#x2019;</p><p>The crowd were all stunned to see this scene. Chu Feng was currently wanted by the Nangong Imperial Clan. Yet, he actually dared to appear in this city. One must know that this city was extremely close to the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s territory.</p><p>This was simply too arrogant, too daring. Chu Feng simply did not place the Nangong Imperial Clan in his eyes at all.</p><p>Provocation, this was an undisguised provocation.</p><p>However, at the moment when the crowd was stunned by Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions, Chu Feng had already disappeared. When people reported this matter to the Nangong Imperial Clan and brought the Nangong Imperial Clan to the city, Chu Feng was already tens of thousands of miles away. Not even his shadow was left behind.</p><p>The two princes from the Nangong Imperial Clan were not only defeated by Chu Feng, they were also stripped by Chu Feng and hung upside down on top of the city wall. When this matter was spread to the Nangong Imperial Clan, Nangong Beidou flew into a violent rage.</p><p>&#x201C;Trash! You two are utter trash! How could you two not defeat Chu Feng even when acting together?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s one thing to not be able to defeat him, but the Cyan Rainbow Sword and the Purple Rainbow Sword were also snatched away by him. Furthermore, you&#x2019;ve been hung upside down on top of the city gate. You have utterly lost all my face.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have painstakingly nurtured you all for these many years in vain. All those resources I&#x2019;ve given to you all are wasted. If I knew this would happen, I might as well have fed those cultivation resources to dogs.&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Beidou pointed at his two sons who were kneeling before him and loudly cursed at them. The finger that he pointed at them with was shivering. He was truly extremely enraged by how disappointing they were. As a clan chief, and the grand Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s clan chief on top of that, what was most important to Nangong Beidou was his face.</p><p>Furthermore&#x2026; it would be one thing if they were captured by Chu Feng and defeated by him. However, the two of them had actually gone to find Chu Feng themselves, and then been taught a lesson by Chu Feng.</p><p>They had overestimated their capabilities. This was an extraordinary shame and humiliation. The two of them had caused him to lose all face.</p><p>Fortunately, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi were his sons. If they were other people, he would&#x2019;ve already killed them with a palm strike.</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Father, it really isn&#x2019;t your sons that were incompetent. Rather, that Chu Feng is too heaven-defying. Other than the Water Immortal Profound Technique, he also controlled four other secret skills. Furthermore, he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation,&#x201D; Nangong Tianhu said.</p><p>&#x201C;Is what you said the truth?&#x201D; Nangong Beidou was shocked to hear those words.</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Father, what second brother said is absolutely true. That girl Nangong Moli was also present. She saw everything. Chu Feng only attacked us in order to save her,&#x201D; Nangong Tianshi said.</p><p>&#x201C;That Chu Feng is actually that powerful? Exactly what are his origins?&#x201D; After hearing those words, Nangong Beidou started to frown deeply. He felt extremely uneasy.</p><p>Based on the intelligence they had obtained, they had come to know that Chu Feng was an Asura World Spiritist. That Martial Emperor-level Asura Evil Spirit had most likely been released by Chu Feng.</p><p>And now, Chu Feng was revealed to be extremely powerful himself. A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, this was something that no other human possessed. This was the potential to become an era&#x2019;s overlord.</p><p>&#x201C;The two of you, excuse yourselves. Without my order, neither of you are allowed to take another step outside of the Nangong Imperial Clan. Oh, that&#x2019;s right. You are not allowed to disturb Nangong Moli again,&#x201D; Nangong Beidou said.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi hurriedly left.</p><p>After the two of them left, Nangong Beidou sat on his throne. At this moment, he appeared to be somewhat beaten. He was truly regretting his decision. If he knew that Chu Feng would be this hard to deal with, he would&#x2019;ve listened to what Nangong Lian said, and not made Chu Feng an enemy. Instead, he would&#x2019;ve befriended Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Chief Nangong, your mental state doesn&#x2019;t appear to be very good,&#x201D; Suddenly, a figure floated in. It was White-browed Immortal.</p><p>Suddenly, Nangong Beidou asked, &#x201C;Brother White-brow, say, if I try to reconcile with that Chu Feng now, would he agree to it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Chief Nangong, why would you be thinking of that? Could it be because the two princes were defeated by Chu Feng?&#x201D; White-browed Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Even now, we do not know that child&#x2019;s background. Exactly who he has supporting him behind his back is a mystery. However, based on what Nangong Lian said, there is an existence behind Chu Feng that is no weaker than me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, the way I see it, the fact that Chu Feng dares to oppose our Nangong Imperial Clan this unrestrainedly means that the person behind him is likely stronger than me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, based on what my two sons said, that Chu Feng actually possesses a battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Furthermore, other than the Water Immortal Profound Technique, he also possesses four other secret skills. Adding on the abnormal sign he triggered that day, I truly think that this child is too heaven-defying. Likely, he is someone who possesses the potential to become an era&#x2019;s overlord. I should not continue to make him an enemy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, Chu Feng attacked my two sons this time for the sake of saving Nangong Moli. This means that that child is a loyal person.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I think that if I can reconcile with Chu Feng, we will have one less great danger,&#x201D; said Nangong Beidou.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
