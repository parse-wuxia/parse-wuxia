<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1608 - Reaching The Auction</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, Aunt Lian, for your advice. While Chu Feng is not very familiar with the nature of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, Chu Feng feels that Yaojiao Tingyu does not seem to be a treacherous and cunning sort. Furthermore, I had promised her that I would go. Thus, if I can, I will have to pay the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts a visit,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s reply, Nangong Lian started to frown slightly. However, she did not say anything about it. Instead, she immediately shifted the topic and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;ve heard from Young Master Ya that you need Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, this junior is planning to set up a spirit formation. However, my own strength is insufficient. Thus, I will need Dragon Mark Spirit Stones to aid me,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones are extremely rare. If you wish to find them, the fastest method would be to go to the Heavenly Law Auction.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you could be said to have saved our clan&#x2019;s Young Master Ya, Miss Baihe and Miss Moli. Thus, our Nangong Clan owes you a favor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Therefore, we will assist you in this matter as best we can. How about this? You and Young Master Ya and the others could return to our Nangong Clan first. I will dispatch people to go to the Heavenly Law Auction to help you make inquiries about whether they possess Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones or not.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If they do, we will definitely do our best to help you obtain them. Even if they do not have any, we will wait until they do and obtain them for you when they do.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian, there is no need to trouble yourself. Brother Nangong, Miss Baihe, Miss Moli and I are friends.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To help friends is something that is only natural. It cannot be considered to be owing favors. Thus, I think it&#x2019;s better that I take care of this matter myself. Let alone, I have just arrived at the Overlord Domain. Thus, there are a lot of places that I would like to see. As for that Heavenly Law Auction, it is one such place. Thus, I wish to go to the Heavenly Law Auction personally,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case. In that case, let&#x2019;s go together. We can set off today. Little friend Chu Feng, what do you think?&#x201D; Nangong Lian said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Brother Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s go together.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Speaking of it, neither Baihe, Moli or I have been to the Heavenly Law Auction before. We also wish to experience it. Let&#x2019;s go together,&#x201D; As Nangong Ya spoke, he took a glance at Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, Moli and I have never been to the Heavenly Law Auction before. We also wish to experience it,&#x201D; Nangong Baihe hurriedly nodded. Even the little girl Nangong Moli nodded like her sister.</p><p>Chu Feng understood what Nangong Ya and the others were thinking. Chu Feng had offended the Beitang Imperial Clan. If the Beitang Imperial Clan were to find an opportunity to take care of him, they would definitely not let him go. At that time, they would likely not do something as casual as teaching Chu Feng a lesson. Rather, they would take his life.</p><p>Thus, Nangong Ya wanted to protect Chu Feng. After all, Aunt Lian was a Martial Emperor. With her present, Chu Feng would be a lot safer. As for Chu Feng, he also understood this. Thus, he did not refuse Nangong Ya and the others. Instead, he smiled and said, &#x201C;If we can travel together, it would naturally be great.&#x201D;</p><p>After this, Aunt Lian had the rest of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan return to the Nangong Imperial Clan first.</p><p>Then, Aunt Lian led Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe, Nangong Moli, Chu Feng, Hong Qiang and Tantai Xue toward the Heavenly Law Auction.</p><p>On their way there, Aunt Lian inquired about Chu Feng&#x2019;s identity. Chu Feng answered all of her questions cleverly and did not expose too much about himself.</p><p>Aunt Lian was a tactful person. When she saw that Chu Feng was intentionally hiding some things, she no longer tried to ask him about them. Instead, she began to tell Chu Feng and the others about the Overlord Domain and the many secret stories that had happened here.</p><p>As they were traveling with many people, the journey was rather interesting. A thing worthy of being mentioned was that during the time when they went through an Ancient Era&#x2019;s Teleportation Formation, Aunt Lian used her Emperor-level martial power to create a war chariot and placed Chu Feng and the others into the war chariot.</p><p>With this war chariot, not only were Chu Feng and the others able to continue to chat while undergoing the teleportation, the speed of the teleportation also increased.</p><p>Aunt Lian said that this was a special skill of Martial Emperors. She said that her cultivation was still only at the rank one Martial Emperor. If a Martial Emperor with a higher cultivation were to create a war chariot, the speed of the war chariot would be even faster.</p><p>Hearing those things Chu Feng felt admiration for a Martial Emperor&apos;s&#x2019; strength. Martial Emperors were truly worthy of being Martial Emperors. All their abilities had surpassed the limits of humans. It would not be excessive to say that they had surpassed humans and possessed divine powers.</p><p>With Aunt Lian&#x2019;s war chariot formed by martial power, the speed of the journey became a lot faster. When they walked out from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Teleportation Formation, they reached another extraordinary location.</p><p>As they looked toward the direction with people, they saw a vast city was located several miles ahead of them. Three enormous characters the size of mountains were floating atop the city. They read, Heavenly Law Auction.</p><p>Those three characters were formed by spirit formations. Thus, not only were they extremely enormous, they were also shining brightly. As they floated in the sky, they looked extremely dazzling.</p><p>That enormous city gate was separated into many smaller city gates. Each and every one of those smaller city gates was guarded by two individuals wearing white gowns and white cloaks. They were people from one of the Three Palaces, the Heavenly Law Palace.</p><p>The Heavenly Law Palace was also known to be the strongest representative among the human powers. Before it, the Four Great Imperial Clans were incapable of comparison.</p><p>The people from the Heavenly Law Palace considered themselves to be the people that inherited the heavenly law. Yet, they would rarely do things that were beneficial to society, things following the heavenly law. Rather, their conduct could be described with one word, pride.</p><p>However, while they were proud, they possessed the qualifications to be proud. At the very least, all of the people from the Heavenly Law Palace that appeared before Chu Feng right now were not weak. They were all Half Martial Emperors.</p><p>Likely, it wasn&#x2019;t that there weren&#x2019;t any people from the Heavenly Law Palace who were not at the Half Martial Emperor level. Rather, they were all training in the Heavenly Law Palace. Chu Feng knew that because he had heard things about the Heavenly Law Palace from Aunt Lian.</p><p>The Heavenly Law Palace was a power that cared greatly about their face and reputation. Thus, in order to manifest their strength, the Heavenly Law Palace had a special rule. That was, anyone underneath Half Martial Emperor level of cultivation would not be allowed to exit the Heavenly Law Palace. Even if they were to exit the Heavenly Law Palace, they would not be allowed to wear the attire of the Heavenly Law Palace, nor were they allowed to say that they were from the Heavenly Law Palace.</p><p>Thus, practically all of the people who wore the attire of the Heavenly Law Palace were Half Martial Emperor or above level experts.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng noticed that even though there were a lot of people traveling about the area outside of the Heavenly Law Auction, the number of people who actually entered it were not many.</p><p>Furthermore, all of the people that entered the Heavenly Law Auction adopted the same trait. That was, they all covered their faces.</p><p>Nangong Baihe had also noticed this. Curiously, she asked Aunt Lian, &#x201C;Why are all of the people that enter there so secretive?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The people that enter the Heavenly Law Auction are most definitely not there to stroll around. They are either selling or buying things; they are people that want to do business.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although the Heavenly Law Palace will ensure your safety in there, no one will care about your life or death once you exit that place.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Stories of people being killed after selling or buying things in the auction are numerous. In order to prevent this sort of thing from happening, people will disguise themselves before entering the Heavenly Law Auction,&#x201D; Aunt Lian explained.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, will we need to disguise ourselves?&#x201D; Nangong Baihe&#x2019;s words had a special meaning. They were, after all, people from the Nangong Imperial Clan. Furthermore, they had Aunt Lian, a Martial Emperor, with them. Thus, she felt that even if they did not disguise themselves, no one would dare to touch them.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
