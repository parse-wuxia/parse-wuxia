<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1560 - Demon Level Genius</strong></p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a storm.&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Chu Feng and the others did not pass through the crowd, Chu Feng was able to see through the crowd with his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes.</p><p>Thus, he was able to clearly see that there was a storm on the surface of the boundless sea. The storm had covered the sky and was surging toward the shore.</p><p>Inside the black hurricane were red bolts of lightning. As they rumbled, they appeared to be extremely terrifying.</p><p>The black hurricane and the red bolts of lightning did not appear without cause.</p><p>They were attacking people. They were attacking the people who had entered the sea and wanted to hurry to the Immortal Island.</p><p>Furthermore, at this moment, there were many who were unable to withstand the violent storm&#x2019;s might and began to flee in fear.</p><p>Those without sufficient strength who tried to pass through the storm by force were injured on the spot. There were even people who let out miserable screams and were killed. They died before the vast crowd. Their bodies were torn and their bones were crushed. They were met with very horrible deaths.</p><p>&#x201C;That storm is created by a spirit formation. It is something man-made. Furthermore, its attack is not something to looked down upon. Ordinary Half Martial Emperors would find it extremely difficult to pass through. Those below Half Martial Emperor practically have no way to pass through that storm alive.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This sort of method could be said to be very powerful. Could it be something that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal did?&#x201D; Tantai Xue asked.</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder so many people have gathered on the golden beach without daring to enter the sea. So they were actually afraid of the storm,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when everyone&#x2019;s gazes were fixed on that violent storm and began to display expressions of fear, quite a few people suddenly charged into the ocean.</p><p>Those people were all Half Martial Emperors. There were even three old men who were peak Half Martial Emperors. It was likely that they had not come from the same power. Yet, at this moment, they had the same intention. They accompanied a group of members of the younger generation with insufficient strength and began to cross through that storm and charge their way into the Immortal Island.</p><p>However, even though they had entered the sea, they still did not dare to travel in the sky. Instead, they stepped onto the water and began to walk on top of the water against the incoming waves. Without even bothering to look back, they charged into that frightening storm.</p><p>At this moment, that scene gave off the impression of being a magnificent sight of men going against nature.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s go too,&#x201D; Right at this moment, Hong Qiang spoke. He was showing a rare excitement.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>When even Hong Qiang had become this excited, Chu Feng was naturally even more excited. With this many experts trying to charge through that storm together, just thinking about it made him excited.</p><p>After they made their decision, Chu Feng, Hong Qiang and Tantai Xue passed through the vast crowd using their ingenious movement martial skills and began to approach the sea.</p><p>After some effort, Chu Feng and the others finally reached the sea. However, right after they set foot onto the water, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes shrunk. A change of expression appeared in his eyes.</p><p>This sea possessed an enormous pressure. To walk on the water was simply an extremely difficult task. One would have to exhaust a great amount of strength for every single step one took.</p><p>Normally, with Chu Feng&#x2019;s current ability, he could travel several miles in a flash. A distance of a thousand miles would only take him a short amount of time to travel. Even though this sea was ninety thousand miles long, it would not take him a long time to travel to the Immortal Island.</p><p>However, the pressure from the sea made it so that Chu Feng and the others would not be able to reveal their actual strength. With the current situation, based on Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength, it would take him at the very minimum more than two days and two nights to travel the distance of ninety thousand miles. Furthermore, that was assuming that he would not meet any other difficulties.</p><p>From this, it could be seen how frightening the pressure of this sea was.</p><p>Suddenly, Hong Qiang said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, Miss Tantai, allow me to lead you two,&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We will have to trouble you senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng and Tantai Xue nodded. In this sort of pressure, it would require a lot of strength and time if Chu Feng and Tantai Xue were to rely only on themselves. However, with Hong Qiang, a peak Half Martial Emperor, with them, it would save them a lot of time and effort.</p><p>Being led by Hong Qiang, the overall speed of the three of them was increased greatly. Soon, they entered the storm.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s surroundings were filled by the black hurricane and the red bolts of lightning. The whistling of the hurricane and the rolls of thunder that came with the lightning were sounding all around Chu Feng in a nonstop manner.</p><p>Fortunately, Hong Qiang was present. If not, it would have been difficult for Chu Feng to travel this effortlessly in this violent storm. He would have to be extremely careful.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, look,&#x201D; Suddenly, Tantai Xue looked back and sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.</p><p>As Chu Feng followed the direction indicated by Tantai Xue, his eyes shone. He discovered that a large group of people had arrived behind them.</p><p>Not only was that group of people wearing the same sort of outfit, there was also a special symbol on their clothes. Nangong Imperial Clan. They were from the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>The people from the Nangong Imperial Clan had arrived. There was a total of a hundred and ninety three people in that group. Compared to the other powers, the Nangong Imperial Clan could be said to have arrived with a great display.</p><p>As for the reason why they were said to have come with a great display, it was not because of the number of people. Rather, it was because of their strength.</p><p>The younger generation in the group were practically all Half Martial Emperors. They numbered a total of eighty.</p><p>The older generation actually numbered more than the younger generation. There were a total of a hundred and thirteen individuals. Among them, there were twenty who were peak Half Martial Emperors like Hong Qiang.</p><p>Furthermore, there was a black-and-white-haired woman whose actual age was unknown, but who looked like a middle aged woman; she was a Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Even a Martial Emperor came. As expected from the Nangong Imperial Clan. It could be said that they&#x2019;ve opened my eyes,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly.</p><p>Why was the Overlord Domain said to be very powerful? At this moment, not long after Chu Feng had arrived, he had experienced for himself why that was the case. That was because the people here were sufficiently powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, look at that little girl. She&#x2019;s very powerful,&#x201D; Tantai Xue indicated to Chu Feng with her gaze.</p><p>After hearing her words, Chu Feng noticed that there was indeed a little girl in the crowd. That little girl appeared to only be twelve years old. She had large, sparkling, translucent eyes and white and rosy cheeks. She was clearly a small child, yet she possessed an outstanding appearance.</p><p>However, this was not the important aspect. The important aspect was that this little girl was a rank six Martial King.</p><p>To be a rank six Martial King at her young age, it could be said to be unimaginable. Not to mention Chu Feng, even Tantai Xue appeared to be inferior when compared to her.</p><p>Genius. A true genius. This little girl was a true genius cultivator.</p><p>To be exact, this little girl could not be described with the word genius. Instead, she should be considered to be a demon level character, a demon level genius.</p><p>What does it mean to broaden one&#x2019;s horizons? This was what it meant by that. Chu Feng had come to the Holy Land of Martialism for so long, yet this was the first time he saw someone possessing this cultivation at this age.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng also discovered that the Martial Emperor-level middle-aged woman was following that little girl closely. It was evident that she was there to protect the little girl.</p><p>Under the leadership of that Martial Emperor, the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s people were extremely fast. Soon, they reached Chu Feng and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother, big sister, you are all lying. Who said only Half Martial Emperors are able to pass through this storm? Look, isn&#x2019;t that big brother over there not a Half Martial Emperor, and a rank eight Martial King instead?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, that little girl pointed at Chu Feng and spoke with a provocative tone toward a man and a woman beside her.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
