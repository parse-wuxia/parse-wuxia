<p><strong> Chapter 2157 - To Save Or Not</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Zzzzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing that, lightning flashed in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes as his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared on his body.</p><p>With the assistance of the power of the Divine Lightnings, Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation increased by two levels in succession. From rank one Half Martial Ancestor, he became a rank three Half Martial Ancestor.</p><p>After his cultivation increased, Chu Feng&#x2019;s speed also increased enormously. His speed was many times faster than lightning itself.</p><p>However, even with that being the case, he was unable to close the distance between him and that strange ferocious beast.</p><p>The speed of that ferocious beast was simply astonishing. It had already surpassed the speed that it should possess based on its cultivation.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a roar sounded from the forest, alarming the vicious ferocious beasts inside the forest and causing them to flee in all directions.</p><p>At this moment, a majestic, enormous azure dragon appeared underneath Chu Feng with overwhelming imposingness.</p><p>That was his Supreme Secret Skill, the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique.</p><p>After Chu Feng unleashed the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique, his speed immediately increased by many times.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng stood on the head of the azure dragon. The azure dragon turned into a ray of azure light that shuttled rapidly through the forest. It was so astonishingly fast that it could raise one&#x2019;s hackles.</p><p>Under this sort of situation, the distance between Chu Feng and that ferocious beast finally began to shorten. After a short moment, the distance between them was less than a thousand meters.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>However, to Chu Feng&#x2019;s surprise, right after he caught up to that ferocious beast, the ferocious beast suddenly turned around, opened its fierce mouth and shot forth many black bodies of light that appeared like black meteors at Chu Feng.</p><p>Those bodies of light all possessed very strong Ancestral-level martial power. After they approached Chu Feng, they exploded on the spot, scattering their power everywhere. Their might was extremely shocking.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank four Half Martial Ancestor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that, Chu Feng started to frown. He finally understood why that ferocious beast was so fast that he could only catch up to it after unleashing all of his strength.</p><p>It turned out that this ferocious beast&#x2019;s battle power surpassed that of ordinary Half Martial Ancestors by two levels of cultivation.</p><p>One must know that when compared to ordinary Martial Emperors and Half Martial Ancestors, Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p><p>As for that ferocious beast, it possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation, one level less than Chu Feng. This meant that this ferocious beast was a special and powerful foe. It was no wonder that it stood out.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng started to rejoice. He rejoiced at the fact that ferocious beast was only a rank four Half Martial Ancestor. If it was a rank five Half Martial Ancestor, it would be very difficult for Chu Feng should he encounter it.</p><p>After all, this ferocious beast possessed the cultivation of rank four Half Martial Ancestor, and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation. When added together, it possessed the same battle power as an ordinary rank six Half Martial Ancestor.</p><p>That level of battle power was equally matched to Chu Feng when he went all-out. If that ferocious beast possessed a higher level of cultivation, Chu Feng would be no match for it.</p><p>&#x201C;Regardless of what sort of origin you might have, your life will be mine today.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng spoke, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader appeared in his hand. Then, while standing on the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique, he brandished the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader and began to attack the ferocious beast head on.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, that ferocious beast was not to be outdone. Seeing that it could not escape Chu Feng, it brandished its two sharp claws and pounced at Chu Feng. It was planning to meet Chu Feng with force.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In an instant, rumbles and energy ripples sprang up everywhere. The ferocious power caused enormous waves that wreaked havoc through their surroundings.</p><p>The battle between the two lasted for an entire hour. The surface area of the forest that was destroyed by their battle was simply incapable of being estimated. The only thing visible were surging black smoke and enormous toppled trees.</p><p>However, in the end, that ferocious beast was still defeated by Chu Feng. One thing worthy of mentioning was that Chu Feng did not unleash his Incomplete Ancestral Armament to defeat this ferocious beast with battle power on par to him. He had used merely the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader to defeat it.</p><p>However, without a doubt, for this ferocious beast to force Chu Feng to this state meant that it was very extraordinary.</p><p>That was definitely a very powerful ferocious beast.</p><p>&#x201C;How strange. It would be one thing for a ferocious beast to not attack others of its own initiative, but its flesh is actually a cultivation resource too.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, how great it would be if I could encounter a couple more,&#x201D; Chu Feng mumbled.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, rumbling sounded from the distance. Chu Feng began to be feel trembling from his feet nonstop.</p><p>In response, Chu Feng turned around and used his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes to survey what was happening in that direction.</p><p>Under the Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, everything became clear. In a forest like this, there was practically nothing capable of blocking Chu Feng&#x2019;s line of sight. Even though the distance was very far, Chu Feng was still able to clearly see what was happening.</p><p>Upon seeing what was happening with his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze changed. He was surprised to discover that a group of ferocious beasts was pursuing several tens of martial cultivators.</p><p>At this moment, the ferocious beasts held absolute superiority. They were killing those fleeing cultivators.</p><p>While being pursued as they ran away, cultivators were dying nonstop. As for those people, they were the same ones that had gotten into a quarrel with Chu Feng outside the Radiance Immortal Mountain.</p><p>That woman who had held the whip with the intention to lash Chu Feng earlier was also among them.</p><p>The rest of the cultivators were all giving their lives to protect that woman. Merely, the difference between their strengths was too wide. If this were to continue, all of them would be eliminated by the ferocious beasts.</p><p>&#x201C;Serves you right,&#x201D; Chu Feng mocked.</p><p>From the actions of those people earlier, he was already able to tell that they were scum who would bully others using their superior status and strength.</p><p>The continued existence of these people might cause countless innocent people to suffer by their evil hands. The way Chu Feng saw it, it was better that they die.</p><p>Although Chu Feng did not act to save them, he continued to survey them with his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes. Chu Feng wished to see exactly how they would meet their deaths.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn?&#x201D; Suddenly, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze changed slightly.</p><p>He was surprised to discover that the woman was crying. Tears were rolling down her eyes and fluttering everywhere as she ran for her life. Chu Feng seemed to be able to hear the sound of her weeping. That sort of sensation caused Chu Feng to feel soft-hearted.</p><p>Had it been before, for people like her, Chu Feng would not be touched even should they start crying.</p><p>However, at this moment, when Chu Feng saw the tears filling that woman&#x2019;s face, he began to enter a mental struggle as to whether he should save them or not.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng could read the woman&#x2019;s lips as she cried. Chu Feng was able to tell that she was not crying for help, but instead urging.</p><p>That crafty and unruly woman was actually urging the people that had pledged their lives to protect her to escape without her.</p><p>This thawed Chu Feng&#x2019;s ice-cold heart.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that a woman like her should be extremely selfish, that she would not be someone who cared about the lives or deaths of others. However, it would appear that that woman was not like that.</p><p>&#x201C;Sure enough, I am still unable to ignore those that need help.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng stood up. He put the corpse of the ferocious beast away in his Cosmos Sack. Then, he turned into a ray of light and rapidly charged toward the direction of that group of people.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, quickly, save yourselves! Do not concern yourselves with me! Quickly, run away!&#x201D;</p><p>Sure enough, that woman was shouting for the others to escape. It was as Chu Feng had seen. She was urging the people that had pledged their lives to protect her to disregard her and escape.</p><p>&#x201C;We shall protect young miss with our lives. All those behind, stop and hold them back!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Those in the front, quickly bring the young miss away! Do not fly in the sky, but run, run through the forest! It&#x2019;ll be easier to escape that way!&#x201D;</p><p>However, the urging from that woman only caused her guards to be even more determined to protect her with their lives. One by one, they began to fiercely fight against the ferocious beasts. Even if they were badly mutilated by the ferocious beasts, they would refuse to cower.</p><p>Those people were most definitely using their lives to buy time for their young miss.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
