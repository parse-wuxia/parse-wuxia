<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1379 - I&#x2019;ll Assume All Responsibility</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you turtle, are all the people from the Cyanwood Mountain as weak and cowardly as you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You dared to speak so boastingly, yet do not dare to show your face. Tell me, are you not a coward?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Following that angry shout came a loud curse. As that loud curse echoed, both the sky and the earth started to violently tremble. It was as if the world were about to collapse, as if doomsday were about to descend.</p><p>&#x201C;What should have come has finally come. It seems that senior Ma guessed correctly, and Sun Lei and the others really do have a helper behind them. Furthermore, it seems that this helper is very remarkable,&#x201D; Hearing the voice that sounded in succession, Chu Feng smiled lightly.</p><p>He was able to tell that this voice was the voice of an old man. Behind the vigorous and powerful voice was an unfathomable cultivation and power.</p><p>Most definitely, a true expert from the World Spiritist Alliance had come. If Chu Feng guessed correctly, this old man was likely one of the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s management world spiritists.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng prepared to set out to face him. After all, they had come knocking on his door. Thus, he could not be an actual turtle, an actual coward.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Song, Granny Lin?&#x201D;</p><p>However, right after Chu Feng stepped out of the door to his house, Grandpa Song and Granny Lin suddenly and rapidly descended from the sky, landing in front of him.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were covered in sweat. Their complexions were not well at all. When they saw Chu Feng, the two of them said together, &#x201C;Chu Feng, quickly, follow us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; seeing their appearances and hearing those words, Chu Feng nodded. He soared into the sky and began to follow Grandpa Song and Granny Lin.</p><p>However, not long after they started flying, Chu Feng discovered that something about the situation was amiss. They were simply not proceeding toward the entrance of the Sealing Ancient Village at all. Instead, they were going at the complete opposite direction.</p><p>Seeing that the situation was amiss, Chu Feng stopped his movement and asked, &#x201C;Grandpa Song, Granny Lin, where are the two of you planning to bring me to?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, Sun Lei has brought his big brother Sun Hao to create trouble for you. Compared to Sun Lei, that Sun Hao is many times more powerful. He possesses the cultivation of a rank nine Martial King. As for his battle techniques, they have reached perfection. You cannot fight him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, you must quickly follow us right now. Lord Village Chief Ma has already prepared a hiding place for you. Furthermore, he has personally declared that you are to not come out no matter what happens. This matter shall be given to Lord Village Chief to handle,&#x201D; Granny Lin explained.</p><p>&#x201C;Sun Lei used his big brother to threaten me when he left this place. At that time, I told him that I would receive him at any time, even if he were to bring his big brother along.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, if I am to escape like this, what would I become?&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he turned around and began to fly toward the direction of the Sealing Ancient Village&#x2019;s entrance.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you must not go there,&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s action, Grandpa Song hurriedly grabbed his arm.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Song, release me. I must go,&#x201D; Chu Feng said earnestly.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, hear me out. It would be one thing if it was only Sun Lei&#x2019;s big brother that has come. But more importantly, Sun Lei and Sun Hao&#x2019;s grandfather has also shown up.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Can you hear that? Those shouts, those curses towards you, they were all being spoken by their grandfather, Sun Feiyang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You are not someone from the Alliance Domain. Thus, you might not know this Sun Feiyang very well. However, I can tell you with certainty that this Sun Feiyang is an extremely tyrannical person. Not only that, his methods are also extremely malicious.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the past, he was drinking at a certain power&#x2019;s territory. Due to a disciple saying that his table manners were bad, he exterminated that entire power. Even though that power&#x2019;s headmaster had led the entire power&#x2019;s elders and disciples to kowtow to him and admit their mistake, he was still not willing to let them off and still massacred all of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, millions of corpses covered that power. The mountains that it had been set up on were all sunk in. The rivers in its territory were all run dry. Truly, everything living there was killed. It was a total bloodbath.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, that matter had caused chaos throughout the Alliance Domain. There were many powers that felt that what Sun Feiyang had done was the conduct of an evil and malicious person, akin to those of the evil cults. Thus, they decided to join forces to suppress Sun Feiyang. However, they ended up being suppressed by the World Spiritist Alliance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because of that, Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s arrogance grew even greater. After that, he ran around tyrannizing everything everywhere he goes. He refuses to speak reason with anyone. Thus, very few people in the entire Alliance Domain dared to provoke him again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, his precious grandson has been beaten up. As such, how could he possibly be willing to leave the matter at that? To speak it simply, if you are to fight against Sun Hao, regardless of whether or not you&#x2019;ll be able to win against Sun Hao, Sun Feiyang would still not let you go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That is the reason why Lord Village Chief wants us to bring you to a safe hiding place. You must definitely not go out. Else, if Sun Feiyang were to catch you, even Lord Village Chief might not be able to protect you,&#x201D; Grandpa Song advised Chu Feng earnestly and with deep worry.</p><p>&#x201C;Sun Feiyang is no fool. Since he dared to shout like this, it means that he most definitely knows that I am in the Sealing Ancient Village. If I am to not show myself the entire time, then, with his temperament, what will he do? Will he not forcibly search the Sealing Ancient Village? Will he not begin to massacre the villagers?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Grandpa Song didn&#x2019;t know how to reply. With Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s evil reputation, if they refused to hand over Chu Feng, Sun Feiyang might really start attacking and massacring them.</p><p>&#x201C;As this matter was brought forth by me, it is only natural for me to take responsibility for it. There is no reason for me to hide.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I am to hide, he can use my hiding as an excuse to attack. If he is to find me in the end, then, once news of this matter spreads out, people would not feel that he was in the wrong. Instead, they would laugh at the Sealing Ancient Village being unable to protect me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, even if Sun Feiyang were to really do something atrocious, it would be within reason for him to do so. After all, at that time, the Sealing Ancient Village will have been in the wrong.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if I am to show myself now, Sun Feiyang will not be able to do anything to me. At the very most, he will have me compete with Sun Hao and put forth some excessive gambling stake in the process.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I am to lose, then I will accept the loss. There&#x2019;s nothing to it. After all, if my skill is inferior, there is nothing that I can say.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if Sun Feiyang is to continue to chirp on and on even after I win, he would then be the one in the wrong. At this time, if the Sealing Ancient Village were to offer their protection to me, it would be within its rights to do so. If this matter were to spread, everyone would condemn Sun Feiyang and no one would find fault with the Sealing Ancient Village,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Grandpa Song and Granny Lin grew silent. They suddenly came to realize that what Chu Feng said was very reasonable.</p><p>At the moment when the two seniors were hesitating, Chu Feng waved his sleeve and struggled free from Grandpa Song&#x2019;s hand. Then, his body shifted; he activated a movement martial skill and began to rapidly fly toward the Sealing Ancient Village&#x2019;s entrance.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, stop,&#x201D; Grandpa Song and Granny Lin only managed to react when they saw that Chu Feng had left. Immediately, they began to chase after him.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Song, Granny Lin, do not stop me. This matter has occurred because of me. As such, I shall be the one to assume responsibility,&#x201D; In anger, Chu Feng unleashed his Thunder Armor and increased his cultivation to that of a rank seven Martial King. Adding on his heaven-defying battle power, Chu Feng&#x2019;s actual battle power right now was comparable to that of a rank one Half Martial Emperor. In this sort of situation, even Grandpa Song and Granny Lin were unable to catch up to him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, his cultivation&#x2026;&#x201D; After they saw Chu Feng unleashing his Thunder Armor, Grandpa Song and Granny Lin were stunned once again. As they sensed Chu Feng&#x2019;s current rank seven Martial King cultivation, the two of them kept feeling like something was different.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2026; seemed to have become stronger again!!!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
