<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1412 - The Alliance Master Apologizing</strong></p><p>After hearing what the mysterious old man said, the crowd present all heaved a sigh of relief. Their suspenseful hearts were finally released.</p><p>However, even though this was the case, they were unable to be completely at ease. After all, with how powerful this mysterious old man was, and how he had challenged their World Spiritist Alliance, even if he was not the Lord Reverend Golden Snake, he would still definitely not be someone easy to trifle with.</p><p>Thus, Chen Sanyuan asked, &#x201C;In that case, who exactly might you be?&#x201D; He truly wished to know exactly who it was that had come to create trouble for them. However, he asked that question with courtesy.</p><p>After all, the opposing party was a Martial Emperor. Even though the Holy Land of Martialism was extremely large, the amount of Martial Emperors were so few that they could be counted.</p><p>&#x201C;Chen Sanyuan, you truly do not recognize this old man?&#x201D; At this moment, the mysterious old man laughed. Then, he waved his sleeve and removed the black cloak.</p><p>At this moment, a black-haired old man wearing plain cotton clothing appeared before the crowd. Although this old man had a head full of black hair, he appeared to be extremely old.</p><p>The best description for his appearance would be &#x2018;as thin as a matchstick.&#x2019; As for his skin, it was so shriveled and filled with wrinkles that it seemed like a dry rag.</p><p>He had a very withered appearance. His appearance was like that of a corpse within a coffin.</p><p>However, for some unknown reason, he gave off a very healthy sensation. That sort of sensation was like he would be able to live forever.</p><p>This old man gave off extraordinary airs. It was as if he was not a person, but was instead a god.</p><p>Martial Emperor. This was what Martial Emperors were. They were people that had already trained their bodies to the limit. From the inside to the outside, they gave off an extraordinary air.</p><p>However, there was a matter that surprised Chu Feng the most. Although this old man was wearing plain cotton clothes, he had a title plate hanging around his waist. As for that title plate, there were four dazzling golden words on it: &#x2018;World Spiritist Sacred Assembly.&#x2019;</p><p>World Spiritist Sacred Assembly. This old man was actually someone from the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Reverend!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s actually you?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of Chen Sanyuan, Zhao Qinghen, Miao Renlong, and the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master shone. They were both shocked and in joy and shouted the old man&#x2019;s title out in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, why is it that it cannot be me?&#x201D; The old man said with a beaming smile. At this moment, his tone was completely different from before. There was no longer that aggressive oppression. Instead, it was now very amiable.</p><p>&#x201C;We pay our respects to Lord Reverend.&#x201D; Chen Sanyuan, Zhao Qinghen, Miao Renlong and the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master finally managed to react to this. Right away, they courteously knelt to pay their respects.</p><p>At the same time they did that, Chen Sanyuan turned to the people in the plaza and shouted, &#x201C;What are you all doing standing there? Quickly, pay your respects to Lord Reverend!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Juniors pay our respects to Lord Reverend,&#x201D; Hearing Chen Sanyuan&#x2019;s words, the people from the World Spiritist Alliance hurriedly knelt to pay their respects to the old man. Even Sima Ying was no exception.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, all of you can rise. There&#x2019;s no need to stand on ceremony.&#x201D; That so-called Lord Reverend lightly waved his hand, and a gentle breeze swept through the entire plaza.</p><p>The people from the World Spiritist Alliance who were kneeling to him were all brought to their feet by that gentle breeze.</p><p>&#x201C;Lil Sis Ying&#x2019;er, exactly who is that Lord Reverend?&#x201D; Chu Feng, who did not know anything about this Lord Reverend, could only ask Sima Ying for guidance.</p><p>&#x201C;How should I explain this to you? Our old ancestor who had defeated the Reverend Golden Snake back then had three personal disciples. All three of them managed to receive the teachings of our old ancestor and inherited his mantle.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After our old ancestor died, one among them succeeded the old ancestor and became the next World Spiritist Sacred Assembly&#x2019;s President. As for the other two, they became the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly&#x2019;s Left and Right Exalted.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The three of them are the most powerful and most divine existences in the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly. They are the true backing, the foundation, of our World Spiritist Alliance. As for that person there, he is Lord Left Reverend,&#x201D; Sima Ying explained.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s actually that amazing? No wonder he&#x2019;s so powerful. Eh, wait, that&#x2019;s wrong. How did you know that he&#x2019;s Lord Left Reverend? I saw your shocked appearance earlier, it should be the first time that you&#x2019;ve seen him, no?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked curiously.</p><p>He was able to tell that practically no one other than Miao Renlong and the three other grand characters present knew who this Lord Left Reverend was.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that this was the first time they were meeting this Lord Left Reverend. Logically, Sima Ying shouldn&#x2019;t know that he was the Lord Left Reverend.</p><p>&#x201C;Lords Left and Right Reverend are people that undergo closed-doors training within the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly all year round. We have merely heard of their legends. Thus, we naturally have never met them before.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, we do know that Lord Left Reverend possesses a head of black hair, and Lord Right Reverend possesses a head of white hair. Since this person before us has black hair, he is naturally Lord Left Reverend,&#x201D; Sima Ying explained.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case. In that case, I am truly fortunate to be able to meet such an amazing character from the World Spiritist Alliance.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng had trained in the Cyanwood Mountain for a very long time. Yet, he had never even seen the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Headmaster before, much less the old monsters from the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly.</p><p>Yet, he had only been in the World Spiritist Alliance for several days, and had already managed to see the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master, two elders from the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly and the Left Reverend who played a crucial role in the entire Holy Land of Martialism. This was truly a fortunate matter. In short, Chu Feng had managed to broaden his horizons.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, I believe you are all most definitely curious as to why it is me that has come to challenge you all time and time again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I know that you all do not dare to ask. However, it&#x2019;s fine, I&#x2019;ll let you know the reason myself,&#x201D; The Left Reverend laughed out loud.</p><p>Then, he said, &#x201C;Lil Mei is my adopted daughter. I have personally trained her for many years. As for her talent, it is also astonishing. She progressed with lightning speed, and possesses exceptional genius. She greatly surpasses the me from my youth.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, no matter how talented one might be, they will still have to learn from experience. Although her talent is exceptional, she has never truly fought others before.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For the sake of allowing her to obtain some actual combat experience, I have brought her over to temper herself. However, if I were to take her to challenge other powers, it would not be very suitable, and would easily create conflicts between us and those other powers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Therefore, after pondering over the matter, I decided to bring Lil Mei to the World Spiritist Alliance. After all, this is our own power. No matter how we compare notes, it will not damage our own relationship.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the reason why I did not reveal who I was at the beginning, and concealed my identity to challenge you all, it is because I wished to test you all, and at the same time, give you a casual lesson.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I wish to let you all know that although the World Spiritist Alliance is the publicly renowned strongest alliance of world spiritists, the strongest power of world spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism, it does not mean that the world spiritists in our World Spiritist Alliance are the strongest in the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After all, the Holy Land of Martialism is such a vast place. It might be possible for there to appear a world spiritist who is capable of suppressing the entire World Spiritist Alliance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For example, there&#x2019;s that Reverend Golden Snake from back then. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the fact that my master had still been alive back then, I&#x2019;m afraid that the many years of glory that our World Spiritist Alliance had built up would&#x2019;ve been destroyed by him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For example, there&#x2019;s Lil Mei today. If she was not my adopted daughter, and was truly a disciple from another power, our World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s honor would have been trampled upon by her today.&#x201D;</p><p>Although the Left Reverend said those words with a smile on his face, and did not have the slightest intention of blame in his tone, his words caused the vast plaza to grow deathly quiet.</p><p>Everyone was quiet. They all felt that what the Left Reverend said was very true. If Lil Mei was not the Left Reverend&#x2019;s adopted daughter, their World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s younger generation would have suffered a crushing defeat today.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Reverend, it is this junior who is incompetent. Please punish me.&#x201D; Suddenly, the Alliance Master knelt onto the ground and humbly apologized.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
