<p><strong> Chapter 2274 - Marriage</strong></p><p>&#x201C;The appointed date?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Xu Yiyi was somewhat perplexed. However, her expression soon changed as two rays of light shone from her eyes. Excitedly, she asked, &#x201C;Could you be talking about that bet?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, it&#x2019;s precisely that bet.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Originally, I was looking forward to a marvelous confrontation between Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. After all, Immortal-cloak World Spiritists are so very rare.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, never would I expect that your Sunset Cloud Valley would actually fail in inviting an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to help them. My anticipation has all been for naught,&#x201D; The green skirted woman said in a rather disappointed manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Not managed to invite an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist? How could that be?&#x201D; Upon hearing those words, Xu Yiyi involuntarily looked to Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng noticed that something was amiss from Xu Yiyi&#x2019;s meaningful gaze.</p><p>&#x201C;I was right over there earlier. I personally heard your Lord Valley Master and your master mentioning that. The two of them have admitted defeat, and were receiving punishment from our Lord Headmaster.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, it remains that they are your Valley Master and your master. Thus, it would be unsuitable for people of the younger generation like myself to be present after they admitted defeat. As such, I was driven out by Lord Headmaster,&#x201D; The green skirted woman said.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand now,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi retrieved the gaze that she was looking at Chu Feng with and revealed a somewhat desolate appearance.</p><p>She had already managed to guess that their Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and her master must not have requested Chu Feng&#x2019;s assistance.</p><p>Although she did not know why they had not requested Chu Feng&#x2019;s assistance, she knew that they must have had their reasons.</p><p>Thus, since both their Lord Valley Master and her master had not requested Chu Feng&#x2019;s assistance, it would be unsuitable for her to request his assistance.</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, it was only a joke to begin with. Victory or defeat truly doesn&#x2019;t matter. After all, our Three Stars Hall possesses an extremely close relationship with your Sunset Cloud Valley.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, the bet between you and senior brother Dou Kang, I fear that he will not be willing to leave the matter at that,&#x201D; The green skirted woman said to Xu Yiyi in a concerned manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Aiya, I nearly forgot that. What am I to do about that?&#x201D; Once that woman mentioned that matter, Xu Yiyi&#x2019;s face was immediately covered with anxiety. She was so nervous that she became unable to sit or stand still, and started to pace left and right. It was as if a major matter weighed on her heart.</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng asked, &#x201C;Yiyi, exactly what sort of gamble was it? May I know about it?&#x201D;</p><p>He was already able to tell that this gamble concerned the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui&#x2019;s honor.</p><p>Furthermore, even Xu Yiyi was involved.</p><p>However, if it was truly related to world spiritists, then he might be able to provide assistance.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like this. Our Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall are allies. As for our Lord Valley Master and my master, they are also close friends of many years with the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster. Their relationship is extremely close.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Our Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall both possess a cherished desire. That is, we both want to invite an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to become our guest elder.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, although our Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall are strong, we remain only tier two powers. As such, we have not been able to successfully invite an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist for many years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At this time last year, my master, Lord Valley Master and the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster were drinking together.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Originally, they were talking and laughing. However, for some unknown reason, they started to discuss their issue with Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Furthermore, because of that, they ended up quarreling with one another.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Due to drinking, their quarrel grew more and more intense. Then, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster began to belittle our Lord Valley Master and my master. He declared that we simply did not possess the ability to invite an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Our Lord Valley Master and my master naturally refused to accept that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As such, they ended up making a bet. Both of our powers were to invite an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist on this date this year, and have them compete with one another to see whose Immortal-cloak World Spiritist was stronger.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you also know that our Sunset Cloud Valley has not managed to successfully invite an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The only one&#x2026;&#x201D; Xu Yiyi sighed, &#x201C; I think our Lord Valley Master and my master did not mention this matter to you. Else, you wouldn&#x2019;t not know about it,&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The two seniors have indeed not mentioned this matter,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded. However, he was feeling sour in his heart.</p><p>The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master would have been able to mention this thing to him easily. However, he didn&#x2019;t do so. It was most definitely because he was worried about inconveniencing Chu Feng.</p><p>If Chu Feng had not wanted to urgently leave upon waking up, then perhaps the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master would have mentioned this matter to him. That was why Chu Feng felt guilty.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, what will happen if they are to lose the bet?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>Before Xu Yiyi could answer Chu Feng, that green skirt girl interrupted, &#x201C;They&#x2019;re all old friends, nothing too serious will happen. At the very most, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Xu Yiyi&#x2019;s master will be jokingly insulted by our Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster. What&#x2019;s crucial is my senior brother Kou Kang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Young lady, may I know what is up with your senior brother Kou Kang?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked the green skirted woman.</p><p>&#x201C;Regarding senior brother Kou Kang&#x2026;&#x201D; When mentioning this matter, the green skirted woman first smiled mischievously. Then, she said, &#x201C;My senior brother Kou Kang is amazing. Not only is he our Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s number one disciple, he is also our Lord Headmaster&#x2019;s personal disciple.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Countless girls are in love with my senior brother Kou Kang. However, senior brother Kou Kang does not even take a glance at them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It was only when senior brother Kou Kang saw little sister Yiyi that he fell in love at first sight.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unfortunately, my little sister Yiyi&#x2019;s vision is higher than even the heavens. She was actually not fond of the personal disciple of our Lord Headmaster, the number one disciple in our Three Stars Hall. Hahaha,&#x201D; The green skirted woman burst into loud laughter. As she spoke, she glanced at Xu Yiyi.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s asking you about the bet, why did you have to mention all that?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi pouted her lips and cast a ruthless side-eye at the green skirted woman.</p><p>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t the complicated relationship between you crucial to the bet? Thus, I must naturally explain it in detail,&#x201D; The green skirted girl said while laughing mischievously.</p><p>It could be seen that the relationship between her and Xu Yiyi was truly close. It could be seen that she had said all that purely with the intention of making fun of Xu Yiyi.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you going to explain or not? If not, I&#x2019;ll explain,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said.</p><p>&#x201C;I will, I will,&#x201D; The woman smiled sweetly. Then, she looked to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Not long after our Lord Headmaster and the two seniors set up their bet, my senior brother Kou Kang and little sister Yiyi both found out about it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The two of them both felt that their respective powers would end up winning. As such, they began to quarrel with one another.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the end, my senior brother Kou Kang was truly smart. Seeing that little sister Yiyi had already lost her rationality to anger, senior brother Kou Kang quick-wittedly made a proposal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He said that since little sister Yiyi so firmly believed that the Immortal-cloak World Spiritist invited by the Sunset Cloud Valley would be more powerful, they might as well make a bet of their own.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He declared that if the Immortal-cloak World Spiritist invited by the Sunset Cloud Valley were to win, he would no longer bother little sister Yiyi.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if the world spiritist invited by the Sunset Cloud Valley were to lose to their Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s world spiritist, then little sister Yiyi would have to marry him,&#x201D; The green skirted woman said.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s actually such a thing?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Girl, what were you thinking? You decided to gamble your marriage just like that?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to smile. Upon seeing Xu Yiyi&#x2019;s reddened face, the smile on Chu Feng&#x2019;s face grew even stronger.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
