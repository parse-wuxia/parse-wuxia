<p><strong> Chapter 1956 - Disparity In Strength</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Xian Yuyin, you truly have balls.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared out of nowhere. He stood in the middle of the sky overlooking Xian Yuyin.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng! Quickly, look, it&#x2019;s Chu Feng! Chu Feng came!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who said that Chu Feng would not dare to come? Exactly who was it earlier that said Chu Feng would not dare to come?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I shall see who dares to say that Chu Feng will not dare to come again. If anyone dares to say that, I&#x2019;ll slap them to death.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s arrival caused the entire crowd to burst into an uproar. This was especially true for those individuals who felt that Chu Feng would show up, just then, they were hooting incessantly.</p><p>Being questioned like this by those that felt Chu Feng would show up, those who felt that Chu Feng would not show up earlier were unable to say anything. They now understood the meaning of &#x2018;seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times.&#x2019; They had truly never expected Chu Feng to really be this courageous.</p><p>Chu Feng dared to even accept the challenge from Xian Yuyin.</p><p>One must know that his opponent, Xian Yuyin, was a rank three Martial Emperor.</p><p>Yet, what about Chu Feng?</p><p>It was said that Chu Feng was only a rank nine Half Martial Emperor. Even if he were to use his techniques to temporarily increase his cultivation, he would only be a rank two Martial Emperor.</p><p>Would Chu Feng be able to defeat Xian Yuyin?</p><p>At that moment, that was the question in the minds of the crowd. At the same time, they were all filled with anticipation for the battle.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I should be the one saying those words, no?&#x201D; Xian Yuyin slowly raised his head. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Xian Yuyin&#x2026; truly detested Chu Feng enormously. The way he saw it, he had originally possessed a bright future. He was someone who would become the future Elf King.</p><p>Yet, all of that was ruined by Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;What makes you qualified to say those words to me?&#x201D; Chu Feng had a slight smile on his face as he looked to Xian Yuyin disdainfully.</p><p>A cultivation of rank three Martial Emperor and an actual Imperial Armament in hand.</p><p>That sort of strength was very strong. Very few people among the younger generation would be able to contend against Xian Yuyin. It was reasonable for Zhang Tianyi to be defeated by him.</p><p>However, to Chu Feng, such a Xian Yuyin was simply no match for him. As such, Chu Feng did not place him in his eyes at all.</p><p>Being looked upon with such contempt by Chu Feng caused Xian Yuyin to become even more enraged. However, he thought about it, and did not burst into a fury. Instead, he smiled slightly and said, &#x201C;That Zhang Tianyi said words similar to what you said before he fought against me. However, do you know what ended up happening to him?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the end, he could only allow himself to be trampled upon by my foot, and allow my sword to pierce into his body repeatedly. I have left his body full of holes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, I told him that the reason why he ended up having to suffer all that is because of his brother Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression did not change much. However, his gaze sunk.</p><p>He knew that what Xian Yuyin said was most likely the truth. Upon thinking of how Zhang Tianyi suffered that sort of torment because of him, Chu Feng felt an enormous amount of heartache.</p><p>&#x201C;What? There is actually animosity between that Xian Yuyin and Chu Feng? He challenged Zhang Tianyi because of Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;One&#x2019;s own conflicts should not involve the other party&#x2019;s relatives or friends. For Xian Yuyin to do such a thing, isn&#x2019;t it a bit too excessive?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the surrounding crowd were able to guess that there was a previous conflict between Xian Yuyin and Chu Feng. However, the majority of them disapproved of Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s actions.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, did you know? I told Zhang Tianyi that as long as he was willing to renounce you as his brother, I would spare him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, he was quite stubborn. Not only did he refuse to renounce his relationship with you, he instead cursed at me. Thus, in the end, I had no choice but to cut his tongue off,&#x201D; As Xian Yuyin spoke, he took out an item from his Cosmos Sack.</p><p>Seeing that item, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed, and his fists clenched tightly. They were clenched so tightly that cracking sounds could be heard.</p><p>Chu Feng felt as if his blood was boiling and about to explode. He was on the verge of being unable to contain himself.</p><p>The reason for that was because what Xian Yuyin held in his hand was a tongue.</p><p>Xian Yuyin had really sliced off Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s tongue.</p><p>&#x201C;Xian Yuyin, you&#x2019;re trying to make me kill you, is that right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a cold voice. At this moment, the tone of his voice had changed completely. It was extremely sunken, yet powerful. Chu Feng&#x2019;s killing intent was evident.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Xian Yuyin burst into loud laughter. Then, his complexion instantly turned cold. He said, &#x201C;Once again, that is what I should be saying to you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right after he finished saying those words, Xian Yuyin immediately brandished his Imperial Armament and unleashed an attack at Chu Feng.</p><p>Once the Imperial Armament was unleashed, its oppressive might filled the surrounding area. Many of the bystanders that were close by were blown away by that oppressive might. All those that were struck by the oppressive might ended up vomiting blood. Some among them even died on the spot.</p><p>&#x201C;What ruthlessness.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s ferocious attack that paid no attention to the lives of the bystanders, seeing how Xian Yuyin had willfully slaughtered the innocent, the hatred in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes grew even more intense.</p><p>Regardless of where one might be, there would always be scum. As for that Xian Yuyin, he was most definitely scum.</p><p>&#x201C;Zzzzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Lightning flashed in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. Then, his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation increased from rank one Martial Emperor to rank three Martial Emperor. His current cultivation was the same as Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s.</p><p>Even though the two of them possessed the same level of cultivation, their battle power was completely different. Even though Xian Yuyin held an Imperial Armament, Chu Feng was not afraid of him in the slightest.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s body shifted to the side and dodged Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s slash. Then, like a thunder strike, Chu Feng descended from the sky. &#x201C;Bang,&#x201D; he arrived before Xian Yuyin.</p><p>The powerful impulse of his descent caused the surrounding rocks to fly about and the earth to rip apart.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D; Seeing how Chu Feng had arrived before him in an instant, Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s expression changed enormously. At that moment, he finally realized the disparity between him and Chu Feng.</p><p>A heaven defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. Chu Feng actually possessed a heaven defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, something even more powerful than what Xian Miaomiao possessed.</p><p>&#x201C;You damned scum. Today, I shall cripple you,&#x201D; Chu Feng did not give Xian Yuyin any opportunity. As he spoke, his hand formed a blade. Then, with a &#x2018;puu,&#x2019; his hand pierced into Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s body and cut open Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s dantian.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhh!!!!!!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Xian Yuyin uttered a heart-tearing and lung-splitting scream and dropped the Imperial Armament that he was holding in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the crowd was looking at Chu Feng and Xian Yuyin again. Merely, upon seeing the scene before them, their expressions all changed enormously and they were filled with shock.</p><p>Chu Feng stood before Xian Yuyin with the same cultivation as him. However, his hand was thrust into Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s dantian. As for Xian Yuyin, he was screaming miserably without the strength to resist Chu Feng at all.</p><p>Chu Feng had defeated Xian Yuyin with merely a single attack. His strength truly broadened the crowd&#x2019;s horizons. In fact, the crowd were all feeling disbelief right now.</p><p>Wasn&#x2019;t Chu Feng a rank nine Half Martial Emperor? Even if he were to use his special techniques to temporarily increase his cultivation, shouldn&#x2019;t he be a rank two Martial Emperor?</p><p>Why would he suddenly become a rank three Martial Emperor? Furthermore, how did he defeat Xian Yuyin, a fellow rank three Martial Emperor, with only a single strike?</p><p>One must know that Xian Yuyin was holding an actual Imperial Armament in his hand. As for Chu Feng, he was not using any weapon at all. With his naked hand, he pierced into Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s dantian.</p><p>The disparity in strength between the two of them was actually that enormous?!!!!!!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
