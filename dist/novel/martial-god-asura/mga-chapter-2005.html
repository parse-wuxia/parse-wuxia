<p><strong> Chapter 2005 - Emperor Qing&#x2019;s Successor</strong></p><p>&#x201C;The three of us are more than enough to take care of you. There&#x2019;s simply no need for Lord Zhan Cangtian.&#x201D;</p><p>Even though they were all known as Evildoers, Evildoers Jin, Yin and Tong were extremely respectful towards the leader of the Five Great Evildoers, Zhan Cangtian.</p><p>&#x201C;So you all actually have someone you&#x2019;re afraid of? It would appear that I have underestimated you all. Not only are you all cowards, you&#x2019;re utter cowards. Even in here, you&#x2019;re still flattering Zhan Cangtian. Could it be that Zhan Cangtian is actually your daddy?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng continued to mock them. As these three Evildoers had done all sorts of malicious things, it was greatly insufficient for him to just kill them. As such, Chu Feng was determined to insult and humiliate them.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you little brat. Continue to talk, I&#x2019;ll take care of you!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, regardless of what sort of ability you might have, you are only able to increase your cultivation to rank four Martial Emperor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You, with your strength of a mere rank four Martial Emperor, did you really think that you would be able to contend against us? Brat, you are truly too arrogant.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, we shall let you know how high the sky is, and how vast the earth is,&#x201D; At that moment, Evildoers Jin, Yin and Tong were all filled with confidence. They felt that they would absolutely be able to kill Chu Feng. Thus, their attacks grew more and more ferocious, and they began to mock Chu Feng back.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems like the three of you have simply not determined the situation before you.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng sneered. Indeed, Evildoers Jin, Yin and Tong now possessed the strength of rank six Martial Emperors. Furthermore, they were able to unleash the might of their Imperial Armaments.</p><p>However, to Chu Feng, none of these three Evildoers possessed strength comparable to the YinYang Immortal.</p><p>Furthermore, even if the YinYang Immortal were still alive, he would not be a match for Chu Feng. As such, how could these three Evildoers possibly be a match for Chu Feng?</p><p>&#x201C;Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng continuously slashed with the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader in his hand. With each slash, a crimson light shot forth. Chu Feng had unleashed an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.</p><p>--- the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;...</p><p>The nine slashes were all shot forth in succession. As the nine crimson slashes were finished, Evildoers Jin, Yin and Tong&#x2019;s bodies were dead with their bodies badly mutilated.</p><p>They had been defeated. When fighting against them, there was simply no need for Chu Feng to use any Heaven Taboo Martial Skills. With merely an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, he had managed to easily defeat them and take their lives.</p><p>&#x201C;Those are quite decent Imperial Armaments. Merely, when used by you all, they are simply being wasted,&#x201D; After Chu Feng killed the three Evildoers, he placed their Imperial Armaments into his own Cosmos Sack. It was not only their Imperial Armaments, even their Cosmos Sacks and all the treasures they held on them were seized by Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, he&#x2026; he actually managed to kill Evildoers Jin, Yin, and Tong so easily?&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Chu Feng had already returned to the battlefield to kill the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace and had completely disregarded the matter concerning the three Evildoers, the surrounding crowd were filled with endless astonishment.</p><p>No matter what, when the Evildoers Jin, Yin, and Tong had fought against the Snow Blade Mad Demon, they had already exhibited their strength to the crowd.</p><p>That said, it was precisely because of that that Chu Feng&#x2019;s killing of the Evildoers Jin, Yin, and Tong demonstrated how much more powerful he was.</p><p>That said, even if Chu Feng had already revealed his renowned ability, his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, it remained that his cultivation had only increased to that of a rank four Martial Emperor.</p><p>A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. Chu Feng possessed a battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. That child was, without a doubt, a demon-level character.</p><p>Earlier, regardless of what the rumors of Chu Feng might be, they had remained only rumors, since only a portion of the people present had seen Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength.</p><p>However, today, there were countless bystanders present. When these people finally saw that Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, all of them were astonished.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In the moment when the crowd was filled with astonishment, Chu Feng began to massacre his enemies ruthlessly.</p><p>Not only was he slaughtering his foes himself, he had also unleashed his two Supreme Secret Skills, the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>&#x201C;The two Supreme Secret Skills are actually both with him?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;According to rumors, the Five Elements Secret Skills cannot coexist in the same host because one&#x2019;s body cannot withstand them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, Chu Feng, he&#x2026; he accomplished that. He&#x2019;s actually that heaven-defying. That child is truly too frightening,&#x201D; Upon seeing the two Supreme Secret Skills, the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, the crowd became even more amazed by Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, that was merely the beginning. After revealing the Fire Immortal Profound Technique and the Water Immortal Profound Technique, Chu Feng unleashed...</p><p>&#x2026; the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique, the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, the Vermilion Bird Resurrection Technique and the Black Tortoise Armor Technique, his Four Great Supreme Secret Skills.</p><p>Furthermore, those Four Great Supreme Secret Skills were all unleashed in their complete form, their Divine Beast appearance. Their roars were capable of shaking the heavenly dome. They were filled with dominance.</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens, what are those?! This sensation, could they also be secret skills?!&#x201D; Sure enough, at the moment when the crowd were all astonished by the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, the appearance of four more Supreme Secret Skills caused the crowd to be so astonished that they became stunned.</p><p>No matter how they looked at it, those four Supreme Secret Skills Chu Feng had unleashed were existences even more frightening than the Fire Immortal Profound Technique and the Water Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>&#x201C;Those four Divine Beasts look exactly the same as Lord Emperor Qing&#x2019;s legendary four guardian beasts. Could it be&#x2026; Chu Feng is Emperor Qing&#x2019;s successor?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What?!!!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Many experts from the Holy Land of Martialism were present to witness this battle. There were many among them that were experienced and knowledgeable. They managed to recognize that Chu Feng&#x2019;s Four Great Supreme Secret Skills were Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s guardian beasts.</p><p>After the first person spoke out, another person spoke out as well. Gradually, practically everyone felt that Chu Feng&#x2019;s Four Great Supreme Secret Skills were Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s four guardian beasts.</p><p>&#x201C;And I wondered how Chu Feng was so heaven-defying. It turns out that he&#x2019;s Emperor Qing, Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s successor.&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the crowd were all astonished by this news.</p><p>If it were someone else that was declared to be Emperor Qing&#x2019;s successor, the crowd would all be skeptical of it. In fact, they would simply not believe it.</p><p>However, when it was Chu Feng, the people were simply not skeptical at all. After all, Chu Feng was truly heaven-defying. There were people who had felt that Chu Feng might be some great almighty being&#x2019;s successor to begin with. Some had even felt that that great almighty person would be Emperor Qing, Qing Xuantian.</p><p>After all, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heaven-defying manner was exactly the same as how heaven-defying Qing Xuantian was.</p><p>And now, when the crowd personally saw the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird and the Black Tortoise, they were certain that Chu Feng was Emperor Qing, Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s successor.</p><p>&#x201C;That brat is truly filled with surprises,&#x201D; Not to mention the bystanders, even the Underworld Palace&#x2019;s Palace Master took notice of this.</p><p>Evidently, he also felt that Chu Feng was Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s successor. Thus, a smile of ease appeared on his face.</p><p>He had decided to help Chu Feng as a gamble. And now, he knew that his gamble was a success. Even disregarding currying favors from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, merely Chu Feng&#x2019;s own strength was sufficient for them, the Underworld Palace, to provide him their full assistance.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; However, this news that caused the Underworld Palace&#x2019;s Palace Master to burst with joy caused both the Heavenly Law Palace&#x2019;s Palace Master and the Mortal King Palace&#x2019;s Palace Master to frown deeply.</p><p>The complacence they had earlier had disappeared completely. It was clear that the two of them were both regretting their decision.</p><p>Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s influence was enormous. Even though ten thousand years had passed, Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s name still remained as a fear to countless people.</p><p>This was especially true for the huge monsters like the Three Palaces. They knew very well how frightening Qing Xuantian was. He had been a true overlord, an existence that surpassed all others in the Holy Land of Martialism back then.</p><p>As for that Chu Feng, he was actually Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s successor? It was no wonder Chu Feng possessed such heaven-defying strength.</p><p>Truth be told, if they had known that Chu Feng was Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s successor, the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace might not have joined hands to attack the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
