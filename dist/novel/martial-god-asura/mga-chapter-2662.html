He stated that those examples were very rare cases. Even though such examples existed, those people were only capable of moving about unhindered through the Upper Realms. None of them were able to move about unhindered through Starfields. He declared that those who came from the lower realms were still unable to compare to the people from the Upper Realms.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;The two of them were very serious in their respective arguments.

During that time, the person prophesied by Exalted Heavenly Fate never appeared. As such, he thought that he would most certainly win the gamble, and was immensely pleased. In fact, he would from time to time go and find Exalted Heavenly Fate to insult him.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Never had he ever anticipated that Chu Feng would appear at a time like this.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Exalted Sacred Tiger saw that Chu Feng was simply exactly as Exalted Heavenly Fate prophesied, and grew scared that he would lose the bet.

That is why he went to find Murdergod Blue Demon,&#x201D; the Old Ape narrated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;How accurate is it?&#x201D; Chu Xuanyuan asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;This is something that I obtained through my interrogation while punishing them. He shouldn&#x2019;t be lying to me. Merely, I don&#x2019;t understand.

But the two of them were originally good friends.

As such, his prophecies are no small matter. Perhaps this is fate. If it wasn&#x2019;t for Exalted Heavenly Fate&#x2019;s gamble with Exalted Sacred Tiger, Exalted Sacred Tiger would not have come to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to set up that grand formation, and Feng&#x2019;er would have received one less chance encounter.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Furthermore, I think that even if Exalted Sacred Tiger is to lose the gamble, Exalted Heavenly Fate might still not necessarily make him cripple his own cultivation.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;This gamble was only to make Exalted Sacred Tiger come to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and stay here for three thousand years to guard his formation. The reason for that is because Exalted Heavenly Fate knew very well that Exalted Sacred Tiger held deep resentment towards him.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Thus, Exalted Sacred Tiger did not come to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to stand guard over his spirit formation for over two thousand years with the goal of three thousand so that he could win the gamble. Mainly, it is because he wanted to make Exalted Heavenly Fate cripple his cultivation.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Between the two of them, it is Exalted Sacred Tiger that is heartless, and not Exalted Heavenly Fate,&#x201D; Chu Xuanyuan said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;What makes the Exalted Sacred Tiger detest Exalted Heavenly Fate like this?&#x201D; Old Ape asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Xuanyuan smiled.
