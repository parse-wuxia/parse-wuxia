<p><strong> Chapter 1896 - Stepping Stone</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What could the Cyanwood Domain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle possibly amount to? It&#x2019;s nothing more than the most ordinary Silver Needle. The number of Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves in our Elf Kingdom that are capable of triggering Silver Needles are simply too numerous to count.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If Chu Feng is able to trigger our Elf Kingdom&#x2019;s Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle, I will have no objection,&#x201D; Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s father said.</p><p>&#x201C;Princess Lingyue, you have mentioned a lot of Chu Feng&#x2019;s strong points. Both openly and secretly, you&#x2019;re just trying to say that Chu Feng is stronger than me, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since that is the case, I shall use the truth to prove whether I or Chu Feng am stronger.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, I will compete with him in triggering the Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. I shall see who will be able to trigger more. If he is able to surpass the number that I can trigger, I will withdraw myself from journeying to the Blood Devouring Killing Formation,&#x201D; Xian Yuyin said.</p><p>&#x201C;That wouldn&#x2019;t do. If you wish to compete, you can compete with battle power or world spirit power. Yet&#x2026; you decided to compete in triggering Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We all know that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles are easily triggered by us Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. However, to humans, they are so difficult to trigger that it is akin to scaling the heavens. Since the beginning of history, there has only been a single human capable of triggering the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle before Chu Feng. And that was Qing Xuantian.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Who is Qing Xuantian? He was the strongest person in the Holy Land of Martialism in his time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In our Elf Kingdom, we possess numerous individuals who are capable of triggering the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. However, which one of them could possibly compare to that Qing Xuantian?&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said with a loud voice.</p><p>At that moment, even the various Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; grand characters grew silent. There were many Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves capable of triggering Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. However, not a single one among them could compare to Qing Xuantian.</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, the fact that you can trigger an Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle simply does not amount to anything. Yet, Chu Feng being able to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle is no small matter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if you are to be able to trigger all nine Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles, you would not be able to compare with Chu Feng triggering a single Silver Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao continued.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, stop hiding behind a woman. I am asking you. Do you dare to accept my challenge or not?&#x201D; Xian Yuyin was so enraged by Xian Miaomiao that his complexion turned green. Feeling helpless, he ended up directly asking Chu Feng and ignoring Xian Miaomiao.</p><p>&#x201C;I am willing to give it a try,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile. His at-ease and confident expression was a clear-cut distinction from Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s angry expression.</p><p>While ordinary people might not care about this sort of thing, the people present were all extraordinary people.</p><p>The Elf King, the Four Grand Elders, the Eight Protectors and the Immeasurable Immortal all had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng after noticing this minor detail.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you simply do not have to compete with him. This is truly too unfair,&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng was actually planning to accept the challenge, Xian Miaomiao immediately spoke to stop him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it is true that this is very unfair. Furthermore, there is simply no need for you to compete with him to accompany Miaomiao. He simply has no say in this matter,&#x201D; Even Princess Lingyue also started to urge Chu Feng against it.</p><p>&#x201C;But, more than proving myself, I truly want to make him shut up,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled slightly. Then, he revealed a serious expression and looked to Xian Miaomiao, &#x201C;Trust me. I will definitely accompany you.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Xian Miaomiao&#x2019;s little face immediately grew stiff. She was stunned and didn&#x2019;t know what to say to stop Chu Feng. Thus, she could only nod her head obediently.</p><p>However, this ordinary scene was completely taken to heart by Xian Yuyin.</p><p>He thought about how Xian Miaomiao detested him, and how she acted like an obedient little kitten before Chu Feng. At that moment, he felt as if he could breathe fire just by opening his mouth. He was so enraged that he felt as if he was on the verge of exploding.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, if you have the courage, then follow me. Today, I shall let you know the gap between you and me!&#x201D; Xian Yuyin shouted at Chu Feng. Then, he flew out of the palace hall.</p><p>Chu Feng flew after him, following closely behind him. Xian Miaomiao and Princess Lingyue also flew out after Chu Feng.</p><p>At that moment, the other people present in the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Palace&#x2019;s palace hall looked to one another. Then, they all turned into rays of light and flew out after them.</p><p>Even these grand characters were not willing to miss out on this great show.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what Xian Yuyin is planning to compete with you in is not the same sort of Silver Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle that you triggered in the Cyanwood Domain. Instead, they&#x2019;re Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There is an enormous difference between Silver Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles and Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. Although the method of triggering them is the same, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Ponds that the Golden Needles reside in possess a pressure that the Silver Needles&#x2019; Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Ponds simply cannot compare with.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, Silver Needles can only be triggered on special days every year. Yet, the Golden Needles can be triggered at any time. Furthermore, one can trigger them many times in succession.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond that we are proceeding toward is located at the centermost region of our Elf Kingdom. There are a total of nine Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles there. For ordinary Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, they would not be able to trigger even a single Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. Those capable of triggering the Golden Needles are all deemed to be geniuses, and will be nurtured with focus.</p><p>&#x201C;My big sister once triggered four Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. As for Xian Yuyin, he triggered five Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao compared her big sister to Xian Yuyin. This comparison was very practical, and clearly revealed how powerful Xian Yuyin was.</p><p>However, Chu Feng possessed no fear at all. Instead, he asked Xian Miaomiao, &#x201C;In that case, how many did you trigger?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Nine,&#x201D; Princess Lingyue said.</p><p>&#x201C;Nine?&#x201D; Hearing that number, Chu Feng was startled.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, it was nine. She has triggered four more Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles than Xian Yuyin, and five more Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles than me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back when my little sister triggered the Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles, even the Elders were shocked. The reason for that was because she had created the abnormal sign of nine lightnings soaring into the sky,&#x201D; Princess Lingyue said.</p><p>&#x201C;Nine lightnings soaring into the sky?&#x201D; Chu Feng revealed a curious gaze.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, nine streams of lightning soaring into the sky. Not only did they illuminate the entire region, they also appeared to have lives, and were extremely magnificent,&#x201D; Princess Lingyue said.</p><p>&#x201C;They were not magnificent. It was inferior to the sight of you triggering the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle back then,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. Chu Feng, I&#x2019;ve heard from Miaomiao that you gave rise to an unprecedented abnormal sign when you triggered the Immortal Needle. According to Miaomiao, it was even more magnificent than the nine lightnings soaring into the sky. Is that true?&#x201D; Princess Lingyue asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;That abnormal sign was caused by my breakthrough,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s true then. In that case, I truly wish to see what sort of abnormal sign you&#x2019;ll cause when you reach a breakthrough,&#x201D; Princess Lingyue had an expression of anticipation.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, I&#x2019;ll inform you to let you come watch the next time I reach a breakthrough,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a deal!&#x201D; Princess Lingyue said.</p><p>&#x201C;Definitely,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;I also want to watch,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay, okay, okay. I&#x2019;ll bring you too,&#x201D; Princess Lingyue said with a smile.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>At the moment when Chu Feng and the others were journeying to the Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles, Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s father arrived beside Xian Yuyin and handed him a special medicinal pellet.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn?&#x201D; After secretly receiving the medicinal pellet from his father, Xian Yuyin revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>As for Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s father, he sent a secret voice transmission to Xian Yuyin, &#x201C;Back then, you were only a bit away from triggering six Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles. That&#x2019;s why I requested for the Avaricious Immortal to refine this medicinal pellet for you. As long as you are to use it, you will definitely be able to trigger six Golden Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needles.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Avaricious Immortal spent a total of three years to concoct this medicinal pellet. He finally managed to successfully concoct it and deliver it to my hands. I truly never expected that you&#x2019;d be able to use it this quickly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you father,&#x201D; Hearing what his father said, Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s expression changed to one of joy. Originally, he was absolutely confident that he would be able to defeat Chu Feng.</p><p>However, with this medicinal pellet, he would be able to widen the disparity between them. Furthermore, he would be able to be held in greater value by the Elf Kingdom. As for Chu Feng, he would end up being despised by others.</p><p>He was certain that Chu Feng was destined to become his stepping stone.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
