With its cunning nature, it would naturally not say much about itself to the people from the Buddha&#x2019;s Heavenly Temple. Thus, Chu Feng believed that Grandmaster Pocket was not lying to him, and that the Buddha&#x2019;s Heavenly Temple knew very little about the old cat.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Chu Feng was unable to obtain any useful information regarding the old cat, Chu Feng did not return to rest in the war chariot.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instead, he chose a secluded place to set up a concealment formation to conceal himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Feng did that with the intention of creating a quiet place so that he could carefully read the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, if Chu Feng were to completely grasp this book, he would be able to make progress in his cultivation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, this sort of progress would not be a one or two time thing.
