<p><strong> Chapter 2162 - The Tang Family&#x2019;s Great Enemy</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Of course. All of the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists are extremely conceited. It is generally very difficult to request their assistance. To have one join our Tang Family would be even harder.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for someone like you who became a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, it is even more rare.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you are the strongest person I&#x2019;ve seen in my life; you are simply my idol.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly how did you cultivate to become this powerful?&#x201D; Tang Ying asked with an expression of admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;Am I allowed to light a fire here?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Light a fire? That&#x2019;s no problem at all. What is it you&#x2019;re planning to do?&#x201D; Tang Ying asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Roast meat to eat,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, a fire spirit formation was ignited in the palace hall.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng clenched his fist and formed a fork with martial power.</p><p>Chu Feng pierced the fork into the Ghostfiend Beast&#x2019;s meat, sat before the fire spirit formation and began to roast the meat.</p><p>This fire spirit formation was one used especially for roasting meat. This, the intensity of the fire was very fierce. Placing the meat on top of it, the meat would be cooked very fast. However, it would not be charred.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you doing? You couldn&#x2019;t possibly be thinking about eating that Ghostfiend Beast&#x2019;s meat, right?&#x201D; Tang Ying asked with a shocked expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Why else would I be roasting it? Do you want to have a try? However, you are only allowed a single small bite at most,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>It was not that Chu Feng was stingy. Rather, the meat of the Ghostfiend Beast contained Natural Energies. Logically, Chu Feng would not spare a single bite. He was already very generous to be willing to have Tang Ying a small bite of the meat.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you crazy? The meat of the Ghostfiend Beast cannot be eaten. It contains a deadly poison,&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng was truly planning to eat the Ghostfiend Beast&#x2019;s meat, Tang Ying was so frightened that her face turned pale.</p><p>&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; Chu Feng examined the Ghostfiend Beast&#x2019;s meat carefully. It was only then that he discovered that the meat of the Ghostfiend Beast really did contain poison. Furthermore, the poison was hidden very deep, and was extremely toxic.</p><p>However, after Chu Feng discovered the poison, he still opened his mouth and took a large bite of the meat before beginning to chew it.</p><p>&#x201C;Holy mother!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re really eating it!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Tang Ying, who stood beside Chu Feng, was terrified by him. She grabbed her hair wildly.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, the speed at which he ate the meat was very fast. In merely a short moment, the large basin filled with meat all entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s stomach.</p><p>The current Chu Feng was no longer an ordinary human. No aspect of him could be compared to ordinary humans. As long as he wished to eat it, not to mention a basin of meat, even if it was several tens of elephants, he would still be able to eat all of it.</p><p>After eating all the meat of the Ghostfiend Beast, Chu Feng felt that the Natural Energies in his dantian had become much more ample. Although it was not enough for him to break through to rank four Half Martial Ancestor, it was not very far away from it.</p><p>Thus, at this moment, Chu Feng revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Y-Y-You&#x2019;re actually fine?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng was not only completely unharmed after eating the meat, but his complexion even grew rosy, Tang Ying opened her mouth wide in shock.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s truly delicious. It was your loss to not eat it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you can&#x2019;t eat it even if you wish to do so now, since it&#x2019;s all gone now,&#x201D; Chu Feng wiped his mouth while smiling mischievously.</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens, you are simply abnormal! The meat of the Ghostfiend Beast is extremely poisonous. How could you be fine? Could it be that you possess a body immune to poison?&#x201D; Tang Ying looked as if she had seen a monster as she began to size up Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of the nonsense. I&#x2019;ve handed the Ghostfiend Beast to you all. Now, where&#x2019;s my Demon Subduing Spring Water? Why is it still not here?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked. After all, saving Wang Qiang had been Chu Feng&#x2019;s goal the entire time.</p><p>&#x201C;The Demon Subduing Spring Water is a bit special. It need to be contained in special containers. Thus, it is slow going to retrieve it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, I know that you most likely want the Demon Subduing Spring Water to take care of that demonic woman in the Darknight Ghost Forest. Our Tang Family possesses a special artifact to take care of it. It would be very difficult for the demonic woman to resist should you use the Demon Subduing Spring Water with the special artifact.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, it is even more time-consuming to fill that artifact with Demon Subduing Spring Water. Just wait patiently for a bit longer. I would not deceive you,&#x201D; Tang Ying said.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that Tang Ying really didn&#x2019;t seem to be deceiving him.</p><p>Furthermore, after the Tang Family learned of his identity as a person from the Heavenly Clans, they acted extremely respectful toward him, and did not dare to offend him.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that the rest of the Tang Family would also not try to deceive him. As such, he asked, &#x201C;Tell me, who it is that your Tang Family managed to offend?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did you know that?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Tang Ying&#x2019;s eyes went wide open. She expressed an expression of shock.</p><p>&#x201C;How complicated could it be? Your city is extremely huge. I can tell that there are a lot of other powers and ordinary families in this city other than your Tang Family.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, on the way here, I noticed that other than some individual powers, many of the powers and ordinary commoners in the city have disappeared. Furthermore, they seemed to have just left not long ago.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, your Tang Family is concealed within your formations. Not only have you all activated all of the defensive formations and spirit formations, the people of your Tang Family also have nervous expressions. It is as if a great enemy is about to arrive.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, other than the people from your Tang Family, you all have also invited over a lot of outsiders. Furthermore, they are all expert martial cultivators.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All of this signifies that your Tang Family is facing a great enemy. Likely, someone will come to invade soon.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Am I right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow, Chu Feng, you are simply amazing. You actually managed to discover all that just through observation?&#x201D; Tang Ying revealed an amazed expression.</p><p>&#x201C;After I finish what I must do, I will abide by my promise and become your bodyguard for a month.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since I am going to protect you, I must first know the situation that your Tang Family is facing right now, as well as who exactly it is that your Tang Family has offended.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, exactly what happened? Tell me the truth,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Cao Family. Like our Tang Family, the Cao Family is a subsidiary power to Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion,&#x201D; Tang Ying spoke honestly.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was startled. The reason for that was because the Pavilion Master of that Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, Chu Feng was particularly interested in that Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion. After all, that was the first person from the Chu Heavenly Clan that he had seen since his arrival in the Outer World.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not interrupt Tang Ying, nor did he reveal any change in expression. Instead, he continued to listen.</p><p>&#x201C;Our Tang Family and the Cao Family both govern over a region. Originally, our two families always minded our own business. Furthermore, due to the fact that we were neighboring powers, our relationship was pretty decent too. We were friends of hundreds of years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, after Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion came to rule over this place, an enormous change occurred. Due to the fact that Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion demands a lot of tribute every year, our Tang Family and the Cao Family ended up having constant friction with one another for the sake of contesting for benefits.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Especially the past two years. Our Tang Family and the Cao Family have become absolute enemies,&#x201D; Tang Ying said.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait a moment, didn&#x2019;t you say that your Tang Family and that Cao Family were both subsidiary powers to Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion? If that&#x2019;s the case, why would Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion let your two families have this sort of friction without doing anything?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion has never once bothered itself with these things. They only care about their own interests. As for their subsidiary powers, it is a battle for the survival of the fittest. They have never once involved themselves with the battles between their subsidiary powers,&#x201D; Tang Ying explained.</p><p>After hearing that, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze grew deep. His impression of Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion grew worse yet again. However, he did not express that. Instead, he said, &#x201C;Continue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With the relationship between our Tang Family and the Cao Family having worsened to this degree, our friendship of many years has long since been cast aside. We have become genuinely hostile powers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the most disgusting aspect is that our Tang Family and the Cao Family already set up an arranged marriage for me before I was even born.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am to be married to the Cao Family&#x2019;s youngest son.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, no one expected that the Cao Family&#x2019;s youngest son would be retarded at birth. No matter how they tried to cure him, they were unable to do so. As such, how could my father be willing to marry me off to him?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, as we are already hostile powers, my father decided to meet with the Cao Family to withdraw the marriage agreement.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, none of us expected that the Cao Family would declare war against our Tang Family with the reason being that we broke our promise of marriage.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They had already planned and schemed for this battle for a very long time. Before they even declared war, they had already invited many outside experts. Thus, our Tang Family was caught completely unprepared.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When we discovered that the situation was amiss, it was already too late.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, although the overall strength of our Tang Family and the Cao Family does not differ by much, it is the Cao Family that holds the advantage. If we were to truly enter a battle, it would definitely be out Tang Family that would end up losing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As my father does not wish to be defeated, he began to invite experts from all over. Several days ago, he went to ask one of his good friends to lend us a hand.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, never did we expect that his good friend had already been bribed by the Cao Family. He actually joined hands with the Cao Family and mounted a sneak attack against my father.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That is why my father ended up being seriously injured,&#x201D; As Tang Ying mentioned this matter, she gnashed her teeth angrily.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
