<p><strong> Chapter 2284 - The Confident Kou Kang</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Junior sister Yiyi, what you&#x2019;ve said is incorrect. Firstly, Brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength and vigor has not been exhausted.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In addition, Brother Chu Feng was only using world spirit techniques earlier. He had not used the slightest bit of his martial power. Thus, if I am to compete against him now, I would not be taking advantage of him in the slightest,&#x201D; Kou Kang said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng is a rank four Half Martial Ancestor, whereas you are a rank six Half Martial Ancestor. There are two entire levels of cultivation between you two. As such, how could it possibly be fair?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said.</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed true that my cultivation is above Brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s by two levels of cultivation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, Brother Chu Feng is a wielder of a Heavenly Bloodline. If he is to use his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, his cultivation will increase to rank six Half Martial Ancestor. Thus, I will not gain any advantage with my higher level of cultivation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course, I am, after all, older than Brother Chu Feng, and have trained in martial cultivation for a longer time than Brother Chu Feng. If we are to spar, I will yield to Brother Chu Feng. After all, it is only a sparring match. I will stop once victory is determined, and not take things too seriously,&#x201D; Kou Kang said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Master, Kou Kang is clearly trying to bully Chu Feng,&#x201D; Feeling helpless, Xu Yiyi turned to request help from her master Su Jingrui.</p><p>However, Su Jingrui was only smiling without saying anything. It was not only Su Jingrui. Even the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster did not have the intention to say anything to stop Kou Kang.</p><p>With their status, if they wanted to stop Kou Kang, they would be able to do so easily with a single word.</p><p>The reason why they didn&#x2019;t say anything was because they also wanted to see exactly how talented Chu Feng was in terms of martial cultivation.</p><p>After all, Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques were already so powerful. If his battle power in the field of martial cultivation would be equally as powerful, he would truly be an exceptional genius.</p><p>Kou Kang&#x2019;s strength was not that much stronger than Chu Feng&#x2019;s. Even if he was stronger, he would not be that much stronger. Furthermore, both of them were part of the younger generation. As such, it would be perfect for them to spar.</p><p>Thus, the three old fellows were all looking forward to the sparring match.</p><p>They were not concerned with the outcome of the match. They were only concerned with how strong Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power would be in terms of martial cultivation.</p><p>Kou Kang was very scheming. Seeing that the three grand characters did not speak to stop him, he realized their intentions. Thus, he grew even more confident. He said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, if it is too difficult, please don&#x2019;t worry yourself over this. I was merely giving a suggestion. If you truly do not wish for it, we can forget about it and pretend that I never said anything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since we have already eaten and drunk to one&#x2019;s content, it would be pretty good to stretch my muscles and bones.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since Brother Kou Kang is interested, I, Chu Feng, will naturally be willing to keep you company,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he put the wine cup in his hand down. He then stood up and moved to the center of the palace hall.</p><p>Although there were only a few participants at the banquet, the palace hall that the banquet was being held in was not small at all. It was more than sufficiently large for Chu Feng and Kou Kang to spar in.</p><p>Right at that moment, Xu Yiyi&#x2019;s voice transmission entered into Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears, &#x201C;Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t be careless. The reason why that Kou Kang who clearly knows that you are a possessor of Heavenly Bloodline still dares to challenge you is because he is a Divine Body.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After utilizing his Divine Power, his cultivation will increase from rank six Half Martial Ancestor to rank seven Half Martial Ancestor. On top of that, he possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation. As such, he is capable of fighting against ordinary rank nine Half Martial Ancestors.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, his Divine Power is very powerful. At the very least, of all of the people of the younger generation I&#x2019;ve seen so far, there has not been a single person capable of defeating Kou Kang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although I deeply detest him, I must still admit that he is a rare martial cultivation genius among the current people of the younger generation.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng did not answer Xu Yiyi after hearing her voice transmission. Instead, he smiled at Xu Yiyi confidently.</p><p>Actually, even if Xu Yiyi didn&#x2019;t mention it, Chu Feng would be able to guess that it was something like that.</p><p>However, even if this Kou Kang was no ordinary character, and could compete against ordinary rank nine Half Martial Ancestors after using his various techniques, he, Chu Feng, was also capable of contending against ordinary rank nine Half Martial Ancestors after using his various techniques.</p><p>Furthermore, with Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power, ordinary rank nine Half Martial Ancestors would simply be no match for him.</p><p>This was also the reason why Chu Feng was willing to take on Kou Kang&#x2019;s challenge even though he knew that this Kou Kang possessed some abilities.</p><p>&#x201C;Zzzzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>As dazzling lightning flashed, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared simultaneously. His cultivation directly increased from rank four Half Martial Ancestor to rank six Half Martial Ancestor.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation was also openly unleashed.</p><p>Everyone present was able to tell how powerful the Chu Feng standing before them was. They were simply unable to judge Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power with his martial cultivation.</p><p>&#x201C;Good. Heavenly Bloodlines are truly exceptional. I, Kou Kang, am honored to be able to spar with Brother Chu Feng today.&#x201D;</p><p>Although Kou Kang said those words with praise toward Chu Feng, his gaze was filled with obvious contempt.</p><p>As Kou Kang spoke, his gaze started to change. Following that, light blue gaseous flames began to surge from his body.</p><p>The light blue gaseous flames were clearly gaseous. Furthermore, there were not a lot of such gaseous flames.</p><p>However, the moment the gaseous flames appeared, it brought forth the sensation of a violently surging sea.</p><p>Divine Power, it was a special sort of Divine Power.</p><p>As the light blue gaseous flames rapidly surged, they soon formed into a light blue armor that covered Kou Kang.</p><p>Although the armor possessed an ordinary appearance, it was not even a tenth as imposing as Chu Feng&#x2019;s Thunder Armor. The two of them could simply not be discussed together.</p><p>However, that light blue armor formed with Divine Power possessed the same sort of power as Chu Feng&#x2019;s Thunder Armor. That is, it increased Kou Kang&#x2019;s cultivation by one level.</p><p>At that moment, Kou Kang was no longer a rank six Half Martial Ancestor. Instead, his cultivation had increased to that of a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.</p><p>Furthermore, his heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation was also completely revealed. All of the people present were able to sense how powerful he was.</p><p>Comparatively, the might that Kou Kang revealed actually even surpassed Chu Feng&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;Kou Kang is truly Kou Kang. His battle power is truly not something that the disciples of our Sunset Cloud Valley can match up to.&#x201D;</p><p>After Kou Kang revealed his Divine Power, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui were unable to stop themselves from praising him.</p><p>Kou Kang&#x2019;s talent could not be considered to be the best in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However, to the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, Kou Kang was most definitely the strongest genius to appear in the last ten thousand years.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, regardless of whether or not you possess a Heavenly Bloodline, it remains that I, Kou Kang, possess a higher cultivation than you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I will not go all-out in this sparring match. I will only consider it to be a spar, and stop the moment the outcome of the battle is determined,&#x201D; Kou Kang said to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.</p><p>Although what Kou Kang said might appear to be courteous, his tone was actually filled with provocation and contempt. It was as if he was indirectly telling Chu Feng that he simply did not place Chu Feng in his eyes at all.</p><p>As for the so-called stopping once the outcome was decided, it was utter bullshit. If possible, Kou Kang would definitely beat Chu Feng to death.</p><p>The reason why he said those things was because he knew that he would not be able to beat Chu Feng to death before all these experts.</p><p>Since he would not have the opportunity to kill or seriously injure Chu Feng, Kou Kang decided that he might as well not bother to injure Chu Feng. Like that, it would show that he was even grander.</p><p>Chu Feng had already seen through all of Kou Kang&#x2019;s little schemes. However, Chu Feng did not expose him. Instead, he calmly said, &#x201C;Since it&#x2019;s a sparring match, we will naturally have to stop once the outcome is determined. Brother Kou Kang, there&#x2019;s no need for you to be modest. Go ahead and unleash your attacks.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, be careful. I, Kou Kang, will be attacking now.&#x201D;</p><p>Once Kou Kang said those words, he began to let out successive footsteps. His footsteps were extremely heavy, bringing forth heavy wind. However, his speed was extremely fast. As his palms swung back and forth, countless blurs formed.</p><p>Kou Kang did not use any martial skills. Instead, he attacked purely with his physical body. However, his attack instantly stunned both Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu, the two other members of the younger generation present.</p><p>The reason for that was because Kou Kang&#x2019;s speed, power and might were simply perfect.</p><p>The current Kou Kang was most definitely not the same Kou Kang who had casually unleashed an attack at Chu Feng earlier. Although he had declared that he would yield to Chu Feng, he was actually taking this very seriously.</p><p>He was determined to defeat Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
