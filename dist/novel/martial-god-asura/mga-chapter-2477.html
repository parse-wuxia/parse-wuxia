<p><strong> Chapter 2477 - Intention To Exterminate A Sect</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Lord Headmaster!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Witnessing that scene, the crowd from the Three Stars Hall all started to panic. One by one, they took out their weapons with the intention to rescue their Lord Headmaster.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t come over!&#x201D;</p><p>However, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster spoke to stop them.</p><p>He knew very well that even if everyone from the Three Stars Hall were to rush over, they would still be no match for the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>Since he was definitely going to be killed today, he had decided to accept death, and did not want the others of the Three Stars Hall to make unnecessary sacrifices.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s it. You&#x2019;ve already made the preparations to die, and do not want your subordinates to die in vain.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, I will instead go against your desires. I will have all of your subordinates die before you.&#x201D;</p><p>The Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had managed to see the desire of the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster. He turned his cold and vicious gaze to the rest of the Three Stars Hall.</p><p>Immediately, overwhelmingly powerful oppressive might enveloped the location of his gaze.</p><p>Faced with the suddenly arriving oppressive might, the crowd of the Three Stars Hall were unable to resist in the slightest.</p><p>Regardless of their cultivation, they were all forced to the ground in an instant.</p><p>&#x201C;Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, if you are to kill me, I will have no complaints. However, we agreed that we will not bring harm upon the innocent. Why are you not honoring your words?!&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;Not honoring my words? Never once did I say that I would not kill the people of your Three Stars Hall.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I might as well tell you the truth. I never planned to spare anyone from your Three Stars Hall to begin with.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Originally, I planned to kill you first, and then exterminate them later. However, I&#x2019;ve changed my mind now. I will have you witness everyone in your Three Stars Hall being killed before you, witness your Three Stars Hall that has been able to continue existing for so long be ruined before you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the reason for all of this, it is all because you chose to protect someone that you shouldn&#x2019;t have,&#x201D; After he finished saying those words, the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shouted, &#x201C;Kill them all! Leave none alive!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Milord!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, countless Ying Heavenly Clansmen and guest elders descended from the sky. They planned to massacre the powerless Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s disciples and elders that were restricted by the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>Blood began to splatter everywhere as screams sounded nonstop.</p><p>The people of the Ying Heavenly Clan did not kill everyone from the Three Stars Hall right away. Instead, they began to use extremely cruel methods to torture them to death.</p><p>&#x201C;No! Stop! Stop immediately!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Witnessing that, seeing his subordinates suffering, seeing them in such misery that death would be a relief, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster shouted nonstop. At the same time, he unleashed intense killing intent.</p><p>He actually wanted to fight again!!!</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuaah.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing the reaction from the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster, the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief rotated his Ancestral Armament sword. Immediately, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster vomited out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Following that, the overwhelming aura and killing intent that the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster was emitting vanished instantly.</p><p>When confronted with the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, who possessed a battle power one level above his own, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster was truly completely powerless to do anything.</p><p>At that moment, he could only powerlessly watch as his subordinates were miserably tortured before him.</p><p>&#x201C;You said that you chose to protect Chu Feng because Chu Feng was worthy of your protection?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then, let me ask you this. Right now, your Three Stars Hall is going to be exterminated. Where is your Chu Feng now?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is this what you mean by worthy of your protection? For someone that you possessed absolutely no association with, you&#x2019;ve brought about the ruin of your sect,&#x201D; The Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief mocked.</p><p>However, faced with such provocation from the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster was not only not angry, he instead smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured. Sooner or later, Chu Feng will find out about what has happened here today. Once he becomes aware of it, he will definitely avenge us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not a single person in our Three Stars Hall will die in vain. Chu Feng will return our sufferings in double to you all,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;Avenge you? Hahaha! That Chu Feng died two years ago. Even if he is still alive, how could a little bastard like him possibly accomplish anything? There is simply no need for Lord Chu Luxuan to act. I myself will be able to easily crush him to death with one finger.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Regardless of what sort of reputation that Chu Feng might possess, the strongest genius in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is neither Chu Feng nor that Li Ming. Rather, it is Lord Chu Luxuan,&#x201D; The Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief stated.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Chu Luxuan? Haha&#x2026; I&#x2019;d nearly forgotten that you&#x2019;ve become Chu Luxuan&#x2019;s lackey.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Your cultivation has been stagnant at rank four Martial Ancestor for so long, unable to make any headway. For you to reach a breakthrough to rank five Martial Ancestor now, I bet it must be because of your master&#x2019;s contributions, right?&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s Headmaster mocked.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re trying to enrage me so that I will kill you sooner? So that you will be able to die contentedly? If you think I&#x2019;ll do that, you&#x2019;re simply indulging in fantasy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, I will definitely make you feel so aggrieved that you&#x2019;ll wish you were dead. I&#x2019;ll make you suffer so much that death will be a relief,&#x201D; The corners of the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s mouth was lifted into a strange smile.</p><p>Then, he shouted to his clansmen, &#x201C;Why are you all still dilly-dallying? Kill them! Kill them all! Today, our Ying Heavenly Clan will dye the Three Stars Hall with blood!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon hearing the order from the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, the Ying Heavenly Clansmen as well as the guest elders no longer continued to torture the people of the Three Stars Hall. Instead, they raised their weapons with the intention of taking the lives of the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s crowd.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, a surge of energy arrived from afar. In the blink of an eye, it enveloped the entire region.</p><p>After that power enveloped the region, everyone from the Ying Heavenly Clan stopped moving. It was as if they were petrified.</p><p>Only the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was still capable of moving.</p><p>&#x201C;Why are you all still standing there? Did you not hear my order?&#x201D;</p><p>The Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was unable to feel the energy that surrounded the region. He only noticed that his clansmen had their weapons raised, yet were not attacking the people of the Three Stars Hall. It caused him to become extremely furious.</p><p>&#x201C;They have heard what you&#x2019;ve said. Merely, they&#x2019;re unable to do as you have ordered.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a voice sounded from the distant sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Who?! Who is it? Who dares meddle in our Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s business?!&#x201D; The Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shouted furiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Soon, two figures flew over from the direction where the voice had sounded. Those two figures appeared before the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s line of sight.</p><p>Those two were none other than Chu Feng and Liu Xiaoli, who had just arrived.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it&#x2019;s you?! You&#x2026; you&#x2019;re actually still alive?!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing Chu Feng, the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief first revealed an astonished expression. Then, he was stunned. He simply did not dare to believe his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng?&#x201D; Hearing that name, the crowd from the Three Stars Hall all raised their heads and turned their gazes to the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, that really is Chu Feng. Everyone, look! Chu Feng is still alive! Chu Feng has come to save us!&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a female voice sounded from the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s crowd.</p><p>Chu Feng was able to tell right away that it was the voice of an acquaintance.</p><p>It was Song Biyu, Chu Feng&#x2019;s friend and a disciple of the Three Stars Hall who possessed a very good relationship with Xu Yiyi.</p><p>Hearing that voice, Chu Feng subconsciously turned his gaze over there. The moment he saw Song Biyu, his previously calm face immediately grew distorted.</p><p>Song Biyu had the same appearance as she did two years ago.</p><p>However, her body was filled with bruises and scars. Wounds astonishing to the eye were all over her lily white skin. Her previously jade green dress had already been dyed bright red.</p><p>Such a beautiful young woman was actually tortured to such a state by the Ying Heavenly Clansmen. It was a tragic sight.</p><p>Furthermore, beside Song Biyu was a person from the Ying Heavenly Clan with their weapon raised and aimed at her dantian.</p><p>In other words, if Chu Feng had arrived a moment later, Song Biyu would&#x2019;ve died miserably at the hands of that Ying Heavenly Clansman.</p><p>Most importantly, scenes similar to Song Biyu&#x2019;s were all over the Three Stars Hall.</p><p>Not only had the Ying Heavenly Clan left the people of the Three Stars Hall riddled with scars from the torture, but they had also raised their weapons with the intention to kill them.</p><p>They were planning to exterminate the entire Three Stars Hall!!!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
