<p><strong> Chapter 2256 - What Is Your Motive</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, Chu Luyang was precisely killed by this child,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master replied.</p><p>&#x201C;However, with his cultivation, how could he possibly possess the strength to kill Chu Luyang?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, this child used despicable means to murder Chu Luyang,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master said.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng wished that he could spit at Li Rui&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s face.</p><p>He thought to himself, &#x2018;This old fart truly dares to say anything. He actually started to put the label of despicable on my head.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;You really killed Chu Luyang?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master turned to ask Chu Feng.</p><p>It was not as simple as a mere question; the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master was also observing Chu Feng. He was trying to see whether or not Li Rui&#x2019;s master had used any special martial techniques to forcibly restrict Chu Feng.</p><p>If Li Rui&#x2019;s master had truly used some sort martial technique to restrict Chu Feng, this Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master would naturally be able to tell with a single glance.</p><p>However, this was also the reason why Li Rui&#x2019;s master was clever. He seemed to knew this Valley Master very well, and knew that he would observe Chu Feng to determine whether or not Chu Feng had been restricted.</p><p>As such, he had not used martial techniques to suppress Chu Feng, and instead meticulously prepared that medicinal pellet for Chu Feng to be forced to take.</p><p>As for the result, it would naturally be the same as what Li Rui&#x2019;s master had anticipated. The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley master did not manage to detect the existence of the medicinal pellet.</p><p>&#x201C;I am asking you whether or not you killed Chu Luyang,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked once again.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Li Rui&#x2019;s master tried to speak so that he could decide Chu Feng&#x2019;s crimes. However, to his surprise, Chu Feng actually nodded.</p><p>He had pleaded guilty?</p><p>Li Rui&#x2019;s master was very shocked to see that Chu Feng had actually nodded to it. Originally, he thought that even if Chu Feng couldn&apos;t speak, he would definitely not plead guilty.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had actually pleaded guilty. This made Li Rui&#x2019;s master very confused. He did not understand what Chu Feng was thinking.</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng have nodded, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master sighed and said, &#x201C;Chu Luyang is, after all, a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan. As he was a subordinate of our Sunset Cloud Valley, I must provide him with justice,&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That is why this subordinate wished to ask Lord Valley Master to convict this Chu Feng,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master pleaded.</p><p>&#x201C;Is there even a need for me for something like this? According to the laws of our Sunset Cloud Valley, those that dare to kill people of our Sunset Cloud Valley are all to&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Before the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master could finish his words, an aged old lady hurried out from within the palace. She said, &#x201C;Lord Valley Master, this is bad! Lady Yan&#x2019;s illness has relapsed again!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My mother&#x2019;s illness has relapsed again?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master hurriedly and worriedly stood up from his seat.</p><p>He had had an extremely calm expression earlier. However, at this moment, his face was covered with panic.</p><p>It could be seen that this Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master was a filial son. Else, he would not panic like that after finding out that his mother&#x2019;s illness had relapsed.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Tuoba, I have ordered you to ask for an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, have you managed to find one?!&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked Li Rui&#x2019;s master.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, regarding this&#x2026; Immortal-cloak World Spiritists are truly too difficult to find. This subordinate is incompetent. So far, I have yet to manage to successfully petition one,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master said with an ashamed expression.</p><p>However, no one noticed that Li Rui&#x2019;s master took a stealthily glance at Chu Feng when he said those words.</p><p>Chu Feng noticed his gaze. From that gaze, Chu Feng saw a sinister smile.</p><p>He was smiling in complacence.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng came to a realization. Not only was the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master a person fond of talents, he was also someone who urgently needed the assistance of an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to help cure his mother&#x2019;s illness.</p><p>In this sort of situation, if the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master found out that Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng would definitely be saved.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was unable to speak. He could only watch as the opportunity to survive slipped past him without him being able to grab onto it.</p><p>That was the reason why Li Rui&#x2019;s master was so complacent. He was feeling proud of how quick-witted he felt himself to be.</p><p>&#x201C;Go, go and ask for for an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist again. No matter what, you must successfully petition one,&#x201D; After the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said those words, he followed that old lady and began to proceed toward the inside of the palace. Evidently, his mother was located inside the palace.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, then, what about this child?&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master hurriedly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Is there even a need to ask? Kill him!!!&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Milord,&#x201D; At this moment, Li Rui&#x2019;s master once again revealed an extremely complacent smile.</p><p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke. &#x201C;Lord Valley Master, you wish to help cure your mother&#x2019;s illness, no? Perhaps myself would be able to help,&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Once Chu Feng spoke, Li Rui&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s expression immediately changed. He was frightened green in the face.</p><p>He truly could not understand how Chu Feng was able to speak after he was fed that medicinal pellet.</p><p>He had clearly heard that medicinal pellet to be something that even Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists would not be able to undo.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he had only just become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, he was also an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. No matter what, he should not be able to undo the effects of that medicinal pellet.</p><p>Exactly what was going on? Why was he able to speak?</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say? You can cure my mother&#x2019;s illness?&#x201D; At this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master turned his sharp gaze toward Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng felt killing intent in the gaze of that Valley Master.</p><p>Evidently, this Valley master did not believe that Chu Feng possessed the ability to treat his mother&#x2019;s illness. Thus, the first thing that came into his mind was that Chu Feng was deceiving him.</p><p>Furthermore, as he was worried and vexed for his mother&#x2019;s illness, his mood was extremely bad. As such, he would not be able to tolerate anyone deceiving him at such a time.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, do not listen to the crazy and unfounded ravings of this child. How could he possibly be able to treat Lady Yan&#x2019;s illness?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Li Rui&#x2019;s master started to panic. He hurriedly walked toward Chu Feng and used his boundless martial power to restrict Chu Feng, preventing him from babbling nonsense again.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, boundless spirit power suddenly burst forth from Chu Feng&#x2019;s body.</p><p>It was Immortal-level spirit power. At this moment, not only was the spirit power hovering around Chu Feng, it was also being controlled by Chu Feng.</p><p>Being enveloped by this spirit power, Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura became completely different. It was as if he were a grand expert.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, do you recognize this?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked loudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng had actually unleashed his Immortal level spirit power, Li Rui&#x2019;s master started to panic even more. He unleashed his surging martial power with the intention of beating down Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit power.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop!!!&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master shouted furiously.</p><p>Once that furious shout was heard, a boundlessly powerful oppressive might swept forth. It not only forcibly scattered Li Rui&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s oppressive might, it also forced Li Rui&#x2019;s master back several steps, nearly knocking him to the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Tuoba Shangshui, is this how you handle things?!!!&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master pointed at Li Rui&#x2019;s master and shouted furiously.</p><p>Seeing that the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master was furious, Li Rui&#x2019;s master hurriedly kneeled to the ground. He said, &#x201C;Lord Valley Master, this subordinate does not know what he did wrong.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You do not know what you did wrong? I asked you to go and petition an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to treat my mother&#x2019;s illness.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the end, after seeking and asking for so long, you&#x2019;ve yet to successfully request an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. If that was even true.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, right now, there is clearly an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist standing right before you. Why did you not tell me about this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly what is your motive?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master stared at Li Rui&#x2019;s master furiously.</p><p>This Valley Master was truly angered.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
