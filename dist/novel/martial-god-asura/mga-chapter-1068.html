<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1068 - Entering the Immortal Pond</strong></p><p>&#x201C;This girl&#x2026; it appears that she isn&#x2019;t that simple.&#x201D; Seeing the back view of the little girl as she left, surprise was written all over Elder Gongsun&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. That little girl, her age is so young yet she was able to steal medicines from a rank nine Martial Lord. That was already abnormal. Then, she suddenly left without any of us detecting it. That is simply extraordinary.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s more than extraordinary, it could even be said to be mystical. Without mentioning of where she came from, with her age, she should have only started martial cultivation; how could she have managed to pass through the forest trial?&#x201D;</p><p>Actually, not only was Elder Gongsun shocked, Wang Wei and the other disciples were also shocked. That was because, at this point, as long as one was not a fool, they would realize that the little girl was extraordinary and most definitely not an ordinary child.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, what did that little girl give you?&#x201D; After exclaiming their shock and surprise, Wang Wei and the others cast their gaze toward the Cosmos Sack in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand. They were extremely curious as to what was in the Cosmos Sack.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Gongsun, do you know if there would be side effects if we were to take a lot of the medicinal pellets handed to us by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves?&#x201D; Chu Feng did not respond to everyone&#x2019;s curiosity. Instead, he turned to Elder Gongsun and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Side effects? Of course not. It is said that the more of that medicinal pellet one takes, the more beneficial it would be. How could it possibly have side effects?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Back when I was young, there had once been a Cyanwood Mountain subsidiary power that, for the purpose of cultivating one of their outstanding disciples, ordered all of their disciples to hand their medicinal pellets to that disciple to use. That disciple ended up obtaining a great harvest and directly reaching a breakthrough in the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.&#x201D; Said Elder Gongsun.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, I am relieved.&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly smiled. He then threw the Cosmos Sack in his hand over to Wang Wei and said, &#x201C;Elder sister Wang Wei, distribute them to everyone. Thirty pellets per person.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Wang Wei was first startled. But, when she inspected the Cosmos Sack given to her by Chu Feng, she became greatly shocked. It turned out that the Cosmos Sack was filled with those medicinal pellets that were handed to them by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. Moreover, their quantity was enormous - there were close to a thousand such medicinal pellets.</p><p>While she was shocked, Wang Wei still kept her composure and began to secretly distribute the medicinal pellets to everyone. Whenever a disciple obtained their distribution of the medicinal pellets, their expressions were filled with extreme shock before being replaced with ecstasy. After their pleasant surprise passed, they cast their gaze at Chu Feng. Moreover, their gazes were filled with envy and admiration.</p><p>Earlier, when Chu Feng acted to save the little girl, they were confused about why he did that. After all, his opponent was someone from the Orion Monastery.</p><p>However now, they began to feel envy and admiration for Chu Feng. That was because this result had shown them that the little girl that Chu Feng saved was extremely extraordinary.</p><p>Indeed; for the purpose of saving the little girl, Chu Feng offended the Orion Monastery. However, it was also because he saved the little girl that Chu Feng got to meet an important person.</p><p>Based on what the little girl displayed, only Heavens knew what sort of powerful character or strong power was behind her back. However, they all felt that whatever it might be that stood behind her, it would be a lot more powerful than the Orion Monastery. Otherwise, how could they nurture such an outstanding little girl?</p><p>And now, Chu Feng had become this little girl&#x2019;s benefactor. How could they not envy him?</p><p>Faced with the gazes of envy and admiration from the disciples, Chu Feng was awfully at ease. Back then, he merely saved the little girl because he couldn&#x2019;t bear to see her being bullied like so. He did not think too much about it.</p><p>Even now, after he knew how extraordinary that little girl was, Chu Feng still did not have any thoughts of obtaining benefits from her. That was because what he had done earlier was nothing more than a slight effort. These medicinal pellets the little girl had given him were more than enough to compensate Chu Feng. Thus, in Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart, they were already even.</p><p>After Wang Wei finished distributing the medicinal pellets, there were still quite a bit remaining. Chu Feng kept a portion to himself and gave the rest to Elder Gongsun.</p><p>Elder Gongsun had already reached rank eight Martial King since a long time ago. However, he had been unable to break through to rank nine Martial King for a very long time. It was all because he was unable to achieve that slight bit of comprehension between rank eight and rank nine Martial King to break through.</p><p>The Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond was also known as the sacred land for cultivation and contained numerous insights for cultivators. Thus, as Elder Gongsun had come to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond, it would be greatly beneficial to him and might even allow him to obtain the insight to break through into rank nine Martial King.</p><p>Elder Gongsun was also conscious about this matter. Thus, he did not reject Chu Feng&#x2019;s good intentions. Merely, in addition to gratefulness, he was rejoicing in his heart. He rejoiced the fact that when he was being forced back by Han Qingyu, he chose to protect Chu Feng. As he knew now, the youngster before him was worthy of him doing so.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s opening. The spirit formation that seals the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond has been opened. We can enter into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond to train now.&#x201D; Suddenly, the enthusiasm of the whole crowd was aroused. Many people even began to cheer.</p><p>Turning their gazes to look, there was indeed a ripple at the direction of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. Below that ripple was a gap. Evidently, that ought to be the entrance to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. The sealing spirit formation was indeed opened. However, it only opened an entrance. However, regardless, they were now able to truly enter into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>Once the spirit formation opened, the people rushed into the entrance. After all, they were only permitted to train in the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond for three days. To them, these three days could be said to be extremely difficult to obtain. Thus, they must naturally make every second count and not waste the slightest amount of time.</p><p>In this sort of situation, Chu Feng and the others also walked into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. After entering into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond, Chu Feng discovered that while the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond was huge, it was not very deep. Or, at the very least, the outer region of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond was not deep.</p><p>Moreover, while the water of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond was multicolored and very gorgeous, it was also extremely clear. One could see the bottom of the pond through the water. There were neither living things or plants at the bottom of the pond. All there was were stones that appeared like jades and pearls, bringing about an even more beautiful appearance to this Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>&#x201C;This truly is a wondrous place.&#x201D;</p><p>Although the location Chu Feng and the others were at was merely the periphery of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond, Chu Feng was already able to sense a special sort of natural energy. This sort of natural energy was something that he had only sensed before from mysterious objects and natural oddities. However, the natural energy in this place was extremely gentle and not berserk at all. Therefore, everyone was able to train in this place and absorb those natural energies.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, the medicinal pellets are truly useful. After taking them, I am able to sense the special power within the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond. Quickly, try it out too. This is truly too miraculous.&#x201D; Said Wang Wei to Chu Feng with joy written all over her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior sister Wang Wei, could it be that you were unable to sense the special power of this place before taking the medicinal pellets?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, before taking the medicinal pellets, I was unable to sense anything. However, after taking the medicinal pellets, I sensed that some difference.&#x201D; Wang Wei nodded. However, her large eyes suddenly shined. She seemed to realized something. Startled, she asked, &#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, could it be that you are able to sense the power of this place even without taking the medicinal pellets?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
