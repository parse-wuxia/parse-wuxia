<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 999 - Chu Feng&apos;s Gravestone</strong></p><p><span style="">With the old ape leading the way, Chu Feng headed deeper into this place. After a short distance, they stopped.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, a gravestone appeared in front of Chu Feng. His expression changed greatly when he saw the name written on it. An indescribable emotion surged into his heart .</span></p><p><span style="">The name written on the gravestone was &#x201C;Chu Feng&#x201D;. With the Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, he discovered it was made by normal Profound Stone. The marked time was actually the exact same as his current age.</span></p><p><span style="">But sadly, the only thing he could discover was the things written on the gravestone. When he looked into the grave, he could see nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, what is this?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked the old ape amidst his confusion.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh&#x2026;&#x201D; The old ape calmly smiled. It was a smile filled with complex emotions. Then, it said, &#x201C;Actually, I really should be calling you &#x2018;Young Master&#x2019;.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, right now, you aren&#x2019;t qualified for that because title respect is gained through strength.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As for this grave, it had saved your life before. And right now, it can save your life again.&#x201D; An invisible wave surged out behind the old ape and into the grave.</span></p><p><span style="">The soil started churning and bursting outward. Very soon, a coffin appeared. It was also made by Profound Stone, but it was enormous. It was more than ten times the size of typical coffins.</span></p><p><span style="">When he looked at it, the complicated emotions in Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart became more and more intense. He truly wanted to know what was inside this coffin and how it was related to him.</span></p><p><span style="">Before, the old ape said this grave had saved his life, and now, it could save him again. What did that mean?</span></p><p><span style="">*bang*</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that moment, a loud muffled sound rang out. The lid of the Profound Stone coffin opened. What appeared within was a blinding light.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a formation. An extremely profound&#x2014;so profound Chu Feng comprehended nothing&#x2014;and indescribably powerful formation. Despite its complexity, Chu Feng could still tell it was a Teleportation Formation, one far superior to ones from the Ancient Era.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go. This formation can bring you safely to the Holy Land of Martialism,&#x201D; said the old ape indifferently.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, you want me to leave?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked in bewilderment.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. You aren&#x2019;t thinking of staying here, right?&#x201D; The old ape calmly shot Chu Feng a glance. Its gaze was like saying, &#x201D;You must leave now!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, do you know how I found this place? Do you know how I&#x2019;ve been in all these years? After countless tribulations, I found where you were. After countless tribulations, I came here. I don&#x2019;t have any other goal. I just want to know who my parents are. I just want to know how they are.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t even understand anything. I don&#x2019;t even know who I&#x2019;m a child to. I don&#x2019;t know even know who my family are. I don&#x2019;t even know why they abandoned me. And now, you want me to leave?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng was clearly a bit agitated. In his eyes, there was a trace of desire. He hoped this old ape would tell him a few things because he knew it definitely had information he wanted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2026;&#x201D; Indeed, the old ape was moved after hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s words. It said, &#x201C;Oh Chu Feng, it&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m unwilling to tell you, it&#x2019;s just that your father is unwilling to let me tell you. He&#x2019;s here right now, actually. However&#x2026; he doesn&#x2019;t want to see you because you&apos;re too weak. So weak you&#x2019;re unworthy to be his son.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart couldn&#x2019;t help but tremble. That reason was quite a devastating one.</span></p><p><span style="">His father, who he dreamt of meeting, who he wholeheartedly admired, wasn&#x2019;t absent. Rather, he was here right now. He was just unwilling to see Chu Feng. And it was because Chu Feng was too weak?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh&#x2026;&#x201D; Suddenly, Chu Feng smiled. It was an abnormally happy smile; but in reality, his heart was filled with extreme anger.</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, he exploded. He roared furiously. Towards the depths of this place, he shouted at the top of his lungs, &#x201C;What kind of bullshit reason is that?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You abandoned me from a young age and had me become another person&#x2019;s child. And now, you&#x2019;re still unwilling to recognize me. And this reason is because I&#x2019;m too weak?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fine, I admit. In comparison to you both, I am indeed very weak. I&#x2019;m so pitifully weak. But must family be weighed by strength? How can there be parents like you in this world?! You&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shut up!&#x201D; But before Chu Feng finished what he wanted to say, the old ape suddenly shouted furiously. That voice was filled with a horrifying aura.</span></p><p><span style="">When it exploded next to Chu Feng&#x2019;s ear, he felt his head buzz as if his entire being had been blown up. Then, his blurred emotions of sorrow and fury were magically pacified.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You aren&#x2019;t qualified to blame him. Go. Before you have sufficient strength, don&#x2019;t come back here. Of course, if you feel he&#x2019;s an unqualified father, you can also choose to never return. You can go live a life you desire,&#x201D; said the old ape again. However, within its tone, there was a hint of sorrow.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng, who had already returned to calmness, felt an indescribable pain in his heart when he saw the old ape&#x2019;s expression. He suddenly realized there were some troubles it couldn&#x2019;t speak of. Or, perhaps his father and his family had troubles they couldn&#x2019;t speak of.</span></p><p><span style="">Regardless how they treated him, when Huangfu Haoyue protected him and when the big dog-head saved him within the Heavenly Road, it was his family behind the scenes. Without them, perhaps he would already be dead.</span></p><p><span style="">So, it didn&#x2019;t matter how they treated him. The reality was that they protected him with everything they had. There would simply be no explanation why they did that if they didn&#x2019;t love Chu Feng. So, he determined this treatment must be due to some trouble.</span></p><p><span style="">But what sort of trouble would force someone to abandon their child?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, since my father is unwilling to see me, I can leave. However, can you ask him what cultivation I need to have before he&#x2019;s willing to see me? What cultivation do I need until he&#x2019;s willing to recognize me as his son?&#x201D; Chu Feng said coldly. In his eyes, there was even a bit of pleading.</span></p><p><span style="">The old ape&#x2019;s gaze changed once again, like a layer of frost being melted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2026;&#x201D; It sighed deeply once again, then said, &#x201C;If I&#x2019;m not mistaken, you must have been seen as a genius in the Eastern Sea Region. But do you know why I&#x2019;m saying you&#x2019;re weak?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
