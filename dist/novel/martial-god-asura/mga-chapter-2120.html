<p><strong> Chapter 2120 - Time To Go</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Why would it be like this, why would it be like this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That Chu Feng, he&#x2019;s actually really someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder. No wonder his talent actually surpasses my own.&#x201D;</p><p>After a moment of being overwhelmed with emotions, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master was extremely depressed. He looked like a deflated ball.</p><p>As for Xue Ji, she stood there watching the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master with a light smile on her face. No one knew what she was thinking.</p><p>However, she did not continue to ask the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master about the strength of the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Outer World.</p><p>As she was an extremely intelligent woman, she had already managed to have an idea of the Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s strength merely by seeing the reaction from the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>Regardless of how powerful the Chu Heavenly Clan might be, it was most definitely a power that the Ying Heavenly Clan could not afford to offend.</p><p>Else, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master would not have reacted in such an alarmed and frightened manner.</p><p>Suddenly, Xue Ji said, &#x201C;Lord Hall Master, it&#x2019;s time for you to go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right, let&#x2019;s go. We must quickly leave this place,&#x201D; The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master nodded repeatedly.</p><p>At that moment, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master no longer possessed any of the grandeur he had showed before. All he possessed was the impatience to quickly escape this place.</p><p>Revenge? He had already tossed the concept of revenge out of his mind. He no longer dared to even think about revenge.</p><p>To the current him, he would be in immense joy if he didn&#x2019;t have to make reprisals.</p><p>&#x201C;Puu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a flash of coldness shone through Xue Ji&#x2019;s eyes. Then, her lily-white hand, like a sharp blade, pierced into the dantain of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>&#x201C;Xue Ji, you!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Sensing the pain from his dantian and the blood spilling out of his abdomen, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master stared at Xue Ji blankly. Evidently&#x2026; he had never expected something like this.</p><p>&#x201C;What? You still don&#x2019;t understand? Didn&#x2019;t I say that it was time for you to go?&#x201D; Xue Ji&#x2019;s beautiful eyes narrowed into two beautiful crescents. Her smile was so very charming. Yet, when seen by the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master, her smile appeared to very wicked.</p><p>&#x201C;No!!!&#x201D; Suddenly, the expression of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master changed enormously. He revealed an unbearable pain.</p><p>He was sensing that his cultivation, his everything, was being stripped away from him, being sucked into Xue Ji&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Not only was Xue Ji planning to destroy his cultivation, she was planning to absorb his cultivation and deprive him of his power.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve been using me the entire time?&#x201D; The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master lifted his head and stared at Xue Ji fiercely.</p><p>&#x201C;Why else did you think I would teach you such a demonic technique instead of using it myself?&#x201D; Xue Ji said.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn you! You&#x2019;ve actually used me as an offering for your own cultivation! You only helped me so I could accumulate power for you! You were waiting for this moment so that you could consume my cultivation!&#x201D; Fury filled the eyes of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve only found out about that now? You are truly slow,&#x201D; Xue Ji said, &#x201C;Actually, I had thought very highly of you. Originally, I had planned to use you for a bit longer, planned to let you live for a bit longer.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you couldn&#x2019;t even help me refine all those lives in the Transmogrification Gate.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve made me waste all those cultivation resources. As such, I must say that you have greatly disappointed me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How could trash like you possibly accomplish anything great in the Outer World?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, you cannot blame me for killing you now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for being too useless.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D; Suddenly, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master shouted angrily. He gained strength out of nowhere, clenched his fist and prepared to attack Xue Ji.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuahh!!!&#x201D; However, right after he raised his fist, he let out a miserable scream.</p><p>At that moment, the body of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master was dismembered, and then pulled into Xue Ji&#x2019;s palm.</p><p>Everything happened too quickly. In merely a short moment, everything was over.</p><p>By the time Xue Ji pulled back her palm, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had turned into a pile of bones. His bones were completely dull, as even his source energy was sucked dry by Xue Ji.</p><p>Only his clothes, his Cosmos Sack and his headdress with the character Ying on it landed beside the pile of bones.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Xue Ji swung her sleeve, and the Cosmos Sack was sucked into her sleeve. Then&#x2026; the clothes of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master began to float.</p><p>Xue Ji used the clothes to wipe the lily-white hand she had used to kill the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>While wiping her hand clean, she looked to the pile of bones with a smile on her face and sighed. &#x201C;It would seem that I&#x2019;ll have to journey to the Outer World by myself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, it should be very interesting,&#x201D; After saying those words, a beautiful and alluring smile emerged on Xue Ji&#x2019;s face.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Xue Ji&#x2019;s body suddenly shifted. She turned into black gaseous flames that hovered for a while before entering the void and disappearing.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;...</p><p>Chu Feng appeared to have fallen asleep.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he discovered that he was on top of a mountain. He was sitting beside a brook.</p><p>He extended his hand and looked at the water in the brook. His silhouette slowly appeared in the flowing water.</p><p>Chu Feng suddenly discovered that his appearance had turned into that of an eight or nine-year-old child. It was his appearance when he was a child.</p><p>Chu Feng then looked around. The scenery was so very familiar to him. Wasn&#x2019;t this the Nine Province Continent&apos;s Azure Province? Wasn&#x2019;t this the scenery of the mountain behind the Chu Family?</p><p>&#x201C;Dream? I&#x2019;m in a dream?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng was an extremely rational person. His rationality allowed him to realize what had happened.</p><p>He had chatted with the blind old man for a long time. As it was extremely late by the time they had finished the chat, the blind old man had told him to properly rest himself, and given him a special sort of fruit.</p><p>That fruit possessed an effect of soothing one&#x2019;s body and mind. Although martial cultivators would be able to live without eating, drinking or sleeping after reaching a certain level of cultivation, sleeping was capable of helping cultivations rest and soothe their minds.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng ate the fruit and soon fell asleep.</p><p>Merely, Chu Feng was too rational a person. His rationality caused him to possess an excessive amount of clear-headedness. Even though he was dreaming, he was still able to immediately determine his situation.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you doing here? Weren&#x2019;t you told to not come here randomly? Get the hell back.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, an excoriating voice sounded. Chu Feng turned around and saw a fair-skinned man rapidly walking toward him.</p><p>&#x201C;Sixth uncle?&#x201D; Seeing that man, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was immediately moved. That man was Chu Feng&#x2019;s sixth uncle, Chu Nanshan.</p><p>That sixth uncle had not been very fond of Chu Feng. As for his son, Chu Hongfei, he was someone that had bullied Chu Feng since they were young.</p><p>Back then, Chu Feng had been very sick and tired of this sixth uncle. However, seeing him now, Chu Feng felt a powerful sense of closeness.</p><p>The reason for that was because this sixth uncle of his had long since passed away. He had died when the Chu Family had been massacred.</p><p>&#x201C;Sixth uncle, I&#x2019;m sorry. I am the one who caused your death,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a great amount of self blame.</p><p>The massacre of the Chu Family was Chu Feng&#x2019;s eternal pain. He felt that if he had not offended Gong Luyun in his youth, the Chu Family would not have met with their misfortune.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you talking about? You are cursing me to die here, no?&#x201D; Chu Nanshan did not know what Chu Feng was talking about, and thought that Chu Feng was cursing him to die. Angrily, he raised his hand and planned to hit Chu Feng.</p><p>As this place was Chu Feng&#x2019;s dream, even if Chu Feng remained rational, he was only a child that had yet to learn martial cultivation here.</p><p>Thus, when his sixth uncle tried to hit him, it would have been impossible for Chu Feng to dodge even if he wanted to. Let alone, Chu Feng did not wish to dodge.</p><p>&#x201C;Huu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a strong gale swept forth from before Chu Feng. It was aimed directly at the sixth uncle.</p><p>That wind was so powerful that not only did it blow away the fallen leaves in the forest, it also blew the sixth uncle back repeatedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Sixth, Feng&#x2019;er is still only a child. Is there a need for you to lower yourself to argue with him?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, a familiar voice sounded beside Chu Feng. Chu Feng turned to the side, and saw a person standing there. Immediately, his heart tightened.</p><p>Standing beside him was a man. That person was his adoptive father, Chu Yuan.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
