<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1870 - Dragon Sword Breaking Through The Void</strong></p><p>The crowd were all exclaiming in astonishment. However, Chu Feng was in no mood to bother with them.</p><p>The only thing on Chu Feng&#x2019;s mind was to quickly remove the bindings on Baili Xuankong and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Ancestor, your cultivation?&#x201D; After a moment, Chu Feng started to frown. He discovered that it was no ordinary spirit formation that had bound Baili Xuankong and the others&#x2019; cultivations. Rather, they were Dragon Mark spirit formations.</p><p>Furthermore, the spirit formations were extremely brilliant. It was impossible for even Chu Feng, who had mastered all sorts of profound world spirit techniques, to undo the spirit formations in a short period of time.</p><p>This meant that there was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist working for the Four Great Imperial Clans. Furthermore, this Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist was not someone to be looked down upon.</p><p>&#x201C;The Four Great Imperial Clans were actually turned into such a state by a Chu Feng. You all are truly too useless.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when Chu Feng was having misgivings, several silhouettes suddenly descended from the distant horizon.</p><p>Those people were all wearing black cloaks and strange masks. They were people from the Dark Hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Dark Hall. The Dark Hall is actually in cahoots with the Four Great Imperial Clans?&#x201D; Upon seeing those people, Chu Feng grew tense.</p><p>Although there were only a bit more than a hundred people from the Dark Hall, they were all Martial Emperors, actual Martial Emperors.</p><p>Furthermore, the person leading them was someone with half snow-white and half pitch-black hair. He appeared extremely strange.</p><p>Furthermore, his cultivation was unfathomable. Even Chu Feng was unable to see through his cultivation. However, with merely a single glance, Chu Feng felt extremely uneasy. He had sensed an enormous threat from that man.</p><p>&#x201C;Dark Hall?!&#x201D; At that moment, everyone was startled. Although it was the first time for many of the people to hear the name &#x2018;Dark Hall,&#x2019; not a single person dared to act disrespectful toward them. After all, their auras were extremely strong.</p><p>Everyone realized that the Dark Hall was an extraordinary existence.</p><p>&#x201C;You all finally showed up. Quickly, attack them and eliminate Chu Feng!&#x201D; After seeing that the people from the Dark Hall had shown up, the Four Great Imperial Clans&#x2019; Utmost Exalted Elders looked as if they had seen their savior. This was especially true for Ximen Baiyuan. At this moment, ecstasy filled his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you trying to give me orders?&#x201D; However, the man that led the group of experts from the Dark Hall cast his ice-cold gaze to Ximen Baiyuan and the others. A trace of killing intent flashed through his crimson eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Faced with that gaze, not to mention the others from the Four Great Imperial Clans, even Ximen Baiyuan turned pale. Even though he was very displeased, he did not dare to go against that man from the Dark Hall. From their manner, it could be seen that the Four Great Imperial Clans deeply feared the Dark Hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly who are you?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a loud voice. The way he saw it, the Dark Hall was an extremely dangerous existence that he absolutely could not look down upon.</p><p>&#x201C;Great question. Who we are is not important. What is important is that you need to know that our Dark Hall shall become the future rulers of the Holy Land of Martialism,&#x201D; That leading man said with a beaming smile.</p><p>Even though he said those words with a smile on his face, his tone was extremely vicious.</p><p>When his words were heard, not to mention Chu Feng and the others, even the bystanders started to tremble and felt as if a chill had run down their bodies. Practically everyone felt an ill premonition from his words.</p><p>A power that no one had ever heard of before actually spoke those sorts of words the moment they appeared, it would inevitably cause people to feel an ill premonition.</p><p>After all, the word &#x2018;ruler&#x2019; was something that even the Three Palaces did not dare to say. Yet, the Dark hall actually dared to say those words?</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a fine dream to become the future ruler,&#x201D; Chu Feng curled his lips and smiled. His words contained a trace of ridicule.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, this is not a dream. Instead, it is the goal that will soon be attained. Chu Feng, I can see that you are a talent. I am able to spare your life on the condition that you join our Dark Hall. I am also able to help you eliminate the Four Great Imperial Clans,&#x201D; That man from the Dark Hall said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the expressions of Ximen Baiyuan and the others from the Four Great Imperial Clans all changed enormously. Their expressions became so ugly that it was as if they had just been fed dog shit.</p><p>It was not only them, the bystanders were also extremely shocked. Originally, they all thought that the arrival of the Dark Hall meant reinforcements for the Four Great Imperial Clans. Yet, such a dramatic thing actually happened?</p><p>The Dark Hall was willing to, for the sake of obtaining Chu Feng, eliminate the Four Great Imperial Clans?</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng laughed lightly at the Dark Hall&#x2019;s invitation. As if he had seen through everything, he said, &#x201C;What if I refuse?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then, today, it will not only be you that shall die. All of your friends will die alongside you,&#x201D; The man from the Dark Hall said. Once he said those words, ice-cold killing intent filled the region.</p><p>That killing intent was truly too frightening. It was absolutely ice-cold. In an instant, it turned the region around him into winter. A bone-chilling wind began to blow, and living things began to freeze. White frost covered the entire region. In fact, many of the crowd&#x2019;s breath turned to ice.</p><p>Even though the martial cultivators possessed very strong bodies, they were shivering after being engulfed by that ice-cold killing intent.</p><p>Seeing that scene, even Chu Feng started to frown. In that moment, he had managed to sense his opponent&#x2019;s aura. The leader of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s experts possessed an aura above Ximen Baiyuan and Zhang Ming. He was a rank six Martial Emperor.</p><p>At that moment, the entire region was completely under his control. This was simply a slaughterhouse that he now ruled. As long as he willed it, anyone he wished to kill would be killed.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;ll give you until the count of ten to consider. After I count to ten, if you still refuse, I will kill all of you,&#x201D; That Dark Hall&#x2019;s man said. Then, he extended his ten fingers and began to count, retrieving his fingers one by one.</p><p>He had done all of this extremely naturally and without the slightest bit of hesitation. From this, it could be seen that he was someone capable of doing what he said, an incomparably ruthless individual.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, accept it,&#x201D; Eggy hurriedly urged Chu Feng to accept.</p><p>&#x201C;The Dark Hall is not a good power. Furthermore, they tried to eliminate the World Spiritist Alliance. The Dark Hall and I are already enemies. As such, how could I lower myself to them? Furthermore&#x2026; I do not trust them,&#x201D; Chu Feng spoke what he truly felt. Even though the Dark Hall had sent him an invitation, Chu Feng felt that there was deceit in their actions. The reason for that was because he did not feel the slightest bit of sincerity in their invitation. Instead, he felt a great amount of danger.</p><p>&#x201C;But if you do not accept it, you will definitely be killed. Not only you, but everyone related to you that is present here will also be killed,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; At that moment, Chu Feng clenched his fists tightly. He was at a loss as to what to do.</p><p>Chu Feng was not worried about his reputation being ruined by becoming the Dark Hall&#x2019;s subordinate. What he feared the most was that it was a trick for the Dark Hall to exploit him and gradually allow them to become an even greater disaster.</p><p>However, if he refused to submit to them, then it would be like Eggy said. Not only would he be killed, he would also have caused the deaths of all the people that were with him. That was something that he absolutely could not allow to happen.</p><p>After struggling within himself for a while, Chu Feng ended up clenching his teeth. He had come to the decision to accept the Dark Hall&#x2019;s invitation.</p><p>He was able to allow himself to endure any sort of hardship, suffering and disgrace. However, he would absolutely not allow his companions to be killed because of him.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at the moment when Chu Feng was about to voice his acceptance of the invitation, a dragon&#x2019;s roar suddenly resonated through the entire region. As that dragon&#x2019;s roar resonated, an enormous golden-bright and dazzling sword appeared while hovering the sky.</p><p>That sword was extremely enormous. It was so huge that it hid the sky and covered the earth. As it flew toward the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s fortress, it bathed the entire region in its light, and actually managed to dispel the ice-cold killing intent of the man from the Dark Hall.</p><p>&#x201C;That is?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression took a huge change. He had discovered that not only was that sword enormous, there was also an enormous dragon carved onto it. That dragon was so vivid and lifelike that it appeared as if that dragon was the soul of that enormous sword. The irresistible and incomparably mighty dragon&#x2019;s roar was emitted by that dragon.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After that enormous golden dragon sword streaked across the vast sky and broke the ice-cold killing intent that filled the region, it let out another dragon&#x2019;s roar. Then, it actually slashed toward that Dark Hall&#x2019;s leading expert.</p><p>&#x201C;Haah!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>In response, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s man clenched his right hand into a fist and shot a fist strike toward that enormous golden dragon sword.</p><p>With that strike, boundless martial power soared into the sky. Then, an enormous fist measuring a hundred meters in length appeared in the sky and collided with that enormous golden dragon sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A loud explosion was heard. The enormous golden dragon sword trembled slightly. However, the enormous fist that the Dark Hall&#x2019;s leading expert had formed from his martial power was actually sliced apart by that sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Ta, ta, ta~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Not only was the enormous fist formed with martial power sliced apart, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s leading expert actually also began to move back several steps in midair before finally being able to steady himself. That grand rank six Martial Emperor was actually beaten back by someone!!!</p><p>At that moment, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s leading expert clenched his fist tightly. The killing intent in his eyes grew even stronger. As he looked to Chu Feng&#x2019;s direction, he ruthlessly said, &#x201C;Nangong Longjian!!!&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
