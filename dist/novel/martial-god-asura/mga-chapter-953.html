<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 953 - Sneaking into the Misty Peak</strong></p><p><span style="">When people from various areas headed towards the Misty Peak, there was also an army of ten million that covertly snuck in.</span></p><p><span style="">They were disguised and walked beneath the sea&#x2014;it was the Crippling Night Demon Sect led by Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">However, no one knew of their arrival because at that very instant, they were all deep under the sea. They were surrounding a round boulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sect Head, you&#x2019;re certain the formation Lady Piaomiao spoke of is here?&#x201D; You Mingdeng slightly frowned as some doubt arose.</span></p><p><span style="">After all, he was a rank four Martial King and a Gold-cloak World Spiritist. Yet, he could not tell what was special about that boulder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no doubt about it.&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly smiled as he firmly nodded. Actually, if it weren&#x2019;t for the Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, he too wouldn&#x2019;t have found that formation because it was really too hidden.</span></p><p><span style="">But despite Chu Feng&#x2019;s assurance, You Mingdeng, and even many others, were doubtful. No matter how you looked at it, this boulder didn&#x2019;t seem like a boundless formation that could move millions of people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master, you can activate this formation.&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled again, and then with mental messaging, he sent the rest of the information to Qiu Canfeng.</span></p><p><span style="">Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s eyes lit up after hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s words. Then, he stood out and laid an Activation Formation on the boulder.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm*</span></p><p><span style="">When the formation was in progress of activating, the seemingly ordinary boulder immediately shone with radiance. The light quickly converged to form a formation which then enveloped all the members within.</span></p><p><span style="">When countless runes swirled around, layer after layer of odd power drifted within the formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Waa, it truly is a formation! It&#x2019;s amazing!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Almost everyone was shocked by its appearance. Expressions of surprise surfaced onto their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">They could feel the power it contained, and they also understood its profoundness.</span></p><p><span style="">Even a person like Qiu Canfeng couldn&#x2019;t help praising, &#x201C;As expected of Lady Piaomiao. This is truly something not an ordinary person can do.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is a formation Senior Piaomiao spent several hundred years building. To say it&#x2019;s her life&#x2019;s work wouldn&#x2019;t be an exaggeration.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This formation is as abstract as the Formation of Multitudinous Talismanic Soldiers cast by Jiang Qisha. It&#x2019;s even a bit more powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As long as it borrows a bit of the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s power, it can create warriors as powerful as us and we can also control them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;On the day of the wedding, Murong Mingtian and Jiang Qisha will definitely welcome the various guests. At that time, activate this formation and attack the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When the army attacks, even if their defenses are enough to stop us, they will ignore the inside of the Misty Peak. I and the First Immortal will then go the stone tablet, and I will cultivate the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But Sect Head, even though it&#x2019;s powerful, this formation cannot allow us to completely overtake the Misty Peak. It will at most catch them off guard for a short while.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As for the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique, it clearly isn&#x2019;t something that&#x2019;s easy to cultivate. There&#x2019;s only a brief amount of time! What if you&#x2019;re discovered?&#x201D; They were still not too worried.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Naturally, the Mysterious Technique isn&#x2019;t easy to cultivate, but I doubt it will be so challenging that I will fail.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Piaomiao had described its cultivation difficulty. If I&#x2019;m not mistaken, I should finish within half a day,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Half a day?&#x201D; You Mingdeng and the others couldn&#x2019;t help deeply gasping.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Half a day is enough. Otherwise, my Zi Ling would truly become his.&#x201D; Chu Feng faintly smiled&#x2014;confidence was worn on the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then&#x2026; fine. We will follow your arrangements.&#x201D; You Mingdeng and the others no longer doubted him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, the success of this conquest will depend on you. If we obtain victory, all of you have done deeds of absolute importance. I, Chu Feng, will definitely repay all of you.&#x201D; Chu Feng was very thankful&#x2014;thankful for these millions of people who were willing to put their lives on the line just for his sake.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sect Head will be victorious! The Crippling Night Demon Sect will be victorious!&#x201D; someone suddenly shouted.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sect Head will be victorious! The Crippling Night Demon Sect will be victorious!&#x201D; Quickly after, everyone started yelling. With these words, they declared their unyielding loyalty towards Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t blame them or anything for making such a ruckus. Although this was already within the borders of the Misty Peak, the sea was very deep. Moreover, they had already laid Concealment Spirit Formations beforehand. Even if they were shouting loudly here, people outside wouldn&#x2019;t be able to hear them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he had to admit, when seeing so many people willing to fight for him, he not only felt gratitude, he felt very emotional.</span></p><p><span style="">Afterwards, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t dally any longer. He leapt forward and came by the First Immortal&#x2019;s side.</span></p><p><span style="">The First Immortal&#x2019;s eyes were glittering, and he said unbelievably, &#x201C;I had thought you relied on your master Qiu Canfeng to become sect head, but I now seem to be wrong.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng gave a light smile, then said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng consumed the Alternation Pellet Lady Piaomiao prepared for him. After changing his appearance, he pretended to be the First Immortal&#x2019;s servant as they advanced toward the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">When they came above the sea surface, Chu Feng saw a lively scene he had never seen before. There were not only several new palaces built within the Misty Peak, it was very crowded scene. One could see people everywhere in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">Rough estimations gave him a number of over a hundred million people. Ninety percent were from other Eastern Sea Region forces. They came here just to watch the upcoming display.</span></p><p><span style="">No one was denied entry to the Misty Peak at that moment. Regardless of strength, position, or status, so long as they came here, they would have good food and good residences. It was quality treatment of guests.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Your Immortal Execution Archipelago truly isn&#x2019;t simple. They&#x2019;ve made such a huge show even when they give their own fianc&#xE9;e to others.&#x201D; Chu Feng couldn&#x2019;t help but mock the First Immortal when they saw such a grand presentation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh&#x2026;&#x201D; It was now his turn to give a light smile. Then, he said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Even if it gets more impressive, so what? It&#x2019;s not like you&#x2019;re going to allow this marriage to be held successfully.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The First Immortal dashed forward and increased his flying speed towards the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng lightly smiled as well. He too dashed forward and followed the First Immortal&#x2019;s steps.</span></p><p><span style="">With the First Immortal leading the way, they were met with no obstructions even though it was occupied by the Immortal Execution Archipelago. They thus easily entered the Misty Peak.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
