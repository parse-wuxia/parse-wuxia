<p><strong>Chapter 2571 - Father&#x2019;s Enemies</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s talk elsewhere,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal looked to Chu Feng. As he spoke, he waved his sleeve.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng felt that the surrounding scenery was rapidly changing.</p><p>When everything returned to normal, Chu Feng was surprised to discover that he had arrived at a different place. He was within a forest, and very far away from the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you alright?&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal asked Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201D; Chu Feng shook his head. Then, he asked the Golden Crane True Immortal, &#x201C;Senior, you know that person?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal nodded. Then, he said, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to ask about him. In the future, he will no longer cause trouble for you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But, why did he decide to target me? I simply do not even know him,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;If a reason must be said, then it&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;re a possessor of a Heavenly Bloodline and&#x2026; named Chu Feng,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong with that?&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;<br>Chu Feng asked in a probing manner. He wanted to know very much&#x2026; exactly what sort of conflict that mysterious blue-gowned individual had with his father.</p><p>The reason for that was because he already knew that that mysterious blue-gowned individual had targeted him because of his father.</p><p>&#x201C;He asked you whether you are Chu Xuanyuan&#x2019;s son earlier. As for that man by the name of Chu Xuanyuan, he brought an ineradicable humiliation upon that man.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He harbored hard feelings because of that. That is all,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it seems that your father has a lot of enemies,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said with a smile on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; Chu Feng echoed in agreement. However, Chu Feng did not feel fear because of that. Rather, he felt excitement, and even pride.</p><p>Those were all enemies of his father. Furthermore, they had all suffered defeat by his father&#x2019;s hand. As such, it meant that his father was very strong.</p><p>To have such a strong father, Chu Feng would naturally be proud.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, in that case, were you in the Kong Heavenly Clan earlier the entire time?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did you witness all that happened earlier?&#x201D; Chu Feng suddenly asked.</p><p>He felt that the Golden Crane True Immortal should not know of his whereabouts, and should not know that he was heading to the Kong Heavenly Clan today.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that the Golden Crane True Immortal must&#x2019;ve investigated and found that Blue Gown was planning to harm him. Thus, fearing that Blue Gown would attack him, he had been secretly monitoring that Blue Gown&#x2019;s movements. Chu Feng felt that to be the reason why the Golden Crane True Immortal was there.</p><p>If that was the case, then the Golden Crane True Immortal should have arrived even before him.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, I followed Blue Gown here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, Chu Feng, I hope that you will not blame me. We from the Upper Realms should not be involved with matters of the Ordinary Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Moreover, the vast Outer World is a boundlessly large place. Slaughters and massacres are happening all over the place. If one needs to prevent them everytime one encountered them, then one would have no time to do anything else.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While it is true that those Kong Heavenly Clansmen died somewhat innocently, that is their fate of being born to the Kong Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, you do not have to think too much about it. This Chu Feng understands your hidden difficulties.&#x201D;</p><p>Although the Golden Crane True Immortal had looked on without doing anything as Ying Mingchao razed the Kong Heavenly Clan to the ground when he could have saved those innocent Kong Heavenly Clansmen, Chu Feng did not blame the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p><p>After all, everyone had their own decisions. Chu Feng did not possess the qualifications to demand that others do what he wanted.</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, it is perfect timing that I encountered you here today. Otherwise, I would have made plans to come find you,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, is there something that you need me for?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I am going to leave the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, you&#x2019;re planning to leave? Where are you going?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I have yet to decide upon where I&#x2019;m going. In short, I do not know when we will meet again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That said, you do not have to worry about Wang Qiang either. I have set up a spirit formation around him. That spirit formation can only be undone from within. As for undoing it from the outside, there is no one in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm that is capable of that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, nothing will happen to Wang Qiang before he completely awakens.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Take this. With this, you will be able to move that spirit formation elsewhere,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal handed a title plate to Chu Feng.</p><p>That title plate was very special. It was formed with spirit power. Rather than saying that it was a title plate, it would be more accurate to call it a key.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you senior. This junior will forever remember the assistance that senior has provided us,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal sighed and said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t mention it. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that I grew greedy back then and demanded that you help me retrieve the God Bestowment Title Plate, your spirit power would not have been injured,&#x201D; When mentioning that, the Golden Crane True Immortal revealed an ashamed expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, when do you plan to leave the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm? With your current cultivation, you are capable of journeying to the Upper Realms.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although the Upper Realms are dangerous, there are more opportunities. With your talent, courage and insight, the speed of your progress will greatly surpass wasting your time here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How about you leave together with me?&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal suddenly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t the Upper Realm&#x2019;s Stairway to Heaven possess a cultivation requirement? My cultivation is clearly insufficient,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a light smile.</p><p>He knew that there were many Stairways to Heaven in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They were all entrances to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p><p>However, there was a cultivation requirement to enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. That is, one must be a True Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;The requirement is relative. If this old man is to accompany you, you do not need to reach the True Immortal realm to enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;This junior appreciates senior&#x2019;s kind intentions. Merely, this junior still has some business that he needs to attend to. Before finishing those things, I will not be leaving here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, I have yet to settle the grudge between the Zhou Heavenly Clan and myself,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. To be honest, I am not too worried about you. After all, there will always be disputes wherever there are cultivators. Regardless of whether it is the Upper Realms, the Ordinary Realms or even the Lower Realms, nowhere is absolutely safe.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That said, martial cultivators need to face difficulties head-on. They need to mature through battles. Only by surviving their battles, grudges and grievances can they distinguish themselves and reach new heights.&#x201D;</p><p>After the Golden Crane True Immortal said those words, the gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng started to change. &#x201C;I think very highly of you. I believe that this Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will not be the pinnacle of your journey. As for the Upper Realms, they too will not be the pinnacle of your journey. In fact, not even the Starfields will be the pinnacle of your journey.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This junior will do his best to not disappoint senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, you will definitely not disappoint me,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal laughed out loud. Then, he said, &#x201C;Let me bring you back. That person&#x2026; might need your consolation.&#x201D;</p><p>As the Golden Crane True Immortal spoke, he waved his sleeve. After the change to the surrounding scenery stopped, Chu Feng once again returned to the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal did not reveal himself. Merely, his voice continued to echo in Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, farewell.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I hope to meet you again in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>Only Chu Feng was able to hear this voice.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;He left just like that? What if your father&#x2019;s enemy hasn&#x2019;t left, and is still planning to attack you?&#x201D;</p><p>Her Lady Queen was a bit worried. As for the person she was worried about, it was naturally that mysterious blue-gowned individual.</p><p>&#x201C;If he had wanted to kill me, he could very well kill me directly. There&#x2019;s no reason for him to go through all the trouble.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There must be some sort of reason as to why he cannot personally attack the people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and personally kill me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Moreover, even if he hasn&#x2019;t left, there&#x2019;s nothing that can be done about it. If it&#x2019;s a blessing, then it will not be a disaster. If it&#x2019;s a disaster, then I will not be able to avoid it. Regardless of what it might be, I must still face it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Otherwise, why would I have come out to temper myself? Wouldn&#x2019;t it be fine if I had just stayed beside my father?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, this Queen is fond of your temperament,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen smiled in satisfaction. Then, she said, &#x201C;It would seem that man really does need your consolation.&#x201D;</p><p>The man that Her Lady Queen spoke of was naturally Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Ying Mingchao was currently sitting on the ground. There were several hundred jugs of wine placed around him. The majority of them were empty.</p><p>Likely, these wines were obtained from the Cosmos Sacks of the dead.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, so you&#x2019;ve returned. Come, come, come&#x2026; accompany big brother in drinking,&#x201D; Ying Mingchao burst into laughter upon seeing Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng walked over to Ying Mingchao and said, &#x201C;Senior, Senior Zi Xunyi possesses her own difficulties too.&#x201D;</p><p>Ying Mingchao sighed, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t address me as senior. I, Ying Mingchao, was only able to escape because of your assistance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;From today on, we shall be brothers. You, Chu Feng, are my brother. If anyone dares to touch you, I will extinguish their entire family.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026; come, let&#x2019;s drink.&#x201D; The smell of alcohol filled Ying Mingchao. It seemed that he was truly drunk.</p><p>However, with his cultivation, how could he possibly be drunk?</p><p>Perhaps this was what they meant when they said that one could intoxicate oneself even if wine would not. Ying Mingchao must be feeling very pained in his heart.</p><p>After all, he had finally managed to escape and meet the person that he had yearned for day and night.</p><p>Yet, after meeting her, they ended up being separated forever.</p><p>The dream that he had had for over a thousand years had been shattered in an instant.</p><p>Pain, how could he not feel pain?</p><p>No matter how strong his cultivation was, he was still human.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, I&#x2019;ll drink with you.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng knew that all consolations would be useless at a time like this. Thus&#x2026; he decided to drink with Ying Mingchao to their heart&#x2019;s delight.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is it?!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng cast an ice-cold gaze toward the nearby sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Get the hell down here!&#x201D;</p><p>As for Ying MIngchao, he was truly overbearing. With a wave of his sleeve, a figure appeared in the sky and smashed onto the ground. The powerful impact created a deep crater in the ground.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
