<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1645 - Sealing The News</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Longjian, what happened to you?&#x201D;</p><p>After Nangong Longjian revealed his injuries, a woman immediately walked out from the depths of the cave within the waterfall.</p><p>This woman was very gorgeous. She was actually Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s mother, Bai Suyan.</p><p>Even though Bai Suyan was already a mother, she still wore very revealing multicolored outfits.</p><p>However, at this moment, when beside Nangong Longjian, she was wearing a very simple and unadorned clothing. Not only that, she revealed a very worried expression when she saw that Nangong Longjian was injured.</p><p>&#x201C;I do not know where that Asura Evil Spirit came from. Even though it was clearly a rank one Martial Emperor, it was able to contend against me. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that I possess an Imperial Armament, I would likely have been unable to defeat it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even though I defeated it, I have exhausted too much of my power. My body was unable to endure it,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian said. His voice had changed. It had changed to a voice that was extremely weak. It turned out that Nangong Longjian had actually been bracing himself and acting tough in front of Nangong Beidou and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Asura Evil Spirit? You&#x2019;re saying that the thing causing chaos and destruction in the city was an Evil Spirit from the Asura Spirit World?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Bai Suyan&#x2019;s expression changed. She seemed to have thought of something.</p><p>Seeing the change in Bai Suyan&#x2019;s expression, Nangong Longjian asked, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Asura World Spirits are legends. It has been a very long time since there has been an Asura World Spiritist who appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Without reason, why would an Asura Evil Spirit suddenly appear?&#x201D; Bai Suyan asked.</p><p>&#x201C;The disappearance of the Boundary Energy signifies the birth of an era&#x2019;s overlord. Right now, we are living in troubled times. In troubled times, heroes will emerge in large numbers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There have already been a lot of geniuses with outstanding talents appearing in this era. That Elf Kingdom&#x2019;s little princess was one of them. It is not strange for an Asura World Spiritist to appear now,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, it&#x2019;s not strange. I am only surprised because I know of an Asura World Spiritist,&#x201D; Bai Suyan said.</p><p>&#x201C;You know of an Asura World Spiritist? Who is that person? Which power does that person belong to?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Nangong Longjian&#x2019;s eyes shone with curiosity.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, I know of an Asura World Spiritist. When Rouchen and I were in the Cyanwood Domain searching for the Imperial Dragon Tree Roots, we became acquaintances with that Asura World Spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He is a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. His age is about the same as Ruochen&#x2019;s and he possesses an exceptionally high talent for martial cultivation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I do not think that it should be him. After all, regardless of how talented he might be, it is impossible for him to grow to such a degree where he&#x2019;d be able to release a Martial Emperor-level Asura Evil Spirit in such a short period of time,&#x201D; Bai Suyan shook her head.</p><p>The person she was thinking about was naturally Chu Feng. However, she immediately rejected her own hypothesis. After all, when they separated from Chu Feng back then, Chu Feng was still only a Martial King. Furthermore, it had not been a long time since they had parted with one another.</p><p>Thus, Bai Suyan was certain that Chu Feng would not be able to obtain a Martial Emperor-level world spirit in such a short period of time, much less release it.</p><p>&#x201C;I do not care about exactly who it is that caused this chaos. What I care the most about right now is Ruochen,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ruochen is doing very well. Come, let&#x2019;s go see her,&#x201D; Bai Suyan said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian nodded. Even though he was very emotionless toward his own relatives, there was a fondness in his actions and tone when he was with Bai Suyan.</p><p>The two of them continued deeper into the mountain cave. After they passed through a concealment formation, another spirit formation appeared before them. There was a pond at the center of this spirit formation.</p><p>Golden water filled the pond. The surface of the water was boiling over. Golden tree roots were placed within the water. Those tree roots were sparkling with a golden shine. Those tree roots contained special power, and were emitting a sensation of invulnerability.</p><p>There was a beautiful young woman in the pond. This woman was completely naked as she sat within the pond, and only her head was above the water.</p><p>This woman was truly beautiful. Her little face was simply that of a standard ice-cold beauty. As for this woman, she was none other than the woman who had experienced crisis after crisis with Chu Feng in the Cyanwood Mountain, Bai Ruochen.</p><p>At this moment, Bai Ruochen was asleep. However, her appearance did not appear to be that of someone who had just fallen asleep. Likely, she had been sleeping for a very long time.</p><p>Even though she had been sleeping for a very long time, she was glowing with radiance. The air that she gave off was much stronger than when she was awake.</p><p>Furthermore, while Bai Ruochen was not wearing anything, her body was wrapped around by the golden tree roots. Wave upon wave of power was entering her body, cleansing her blood, her meridians, her dantian and her soul.</p><p>&#x201C;How much longer till Ruochen wakes up?&#x201D; Nangong Longjian asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; Bai Suyan shook her head.</p><p>&#x201C;Hopefully everything will still be on time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Cough, cough, cough&#x2026;&#x201D; Right at this moment, Nangong Longjian started to cough violently. Seeing that, Bai Suyan immediately stepped forward and lent an arm to support him.</p><p>However, suddenly, Bai Suyan&#x2019;s expression became extremely ugly. There was a large amount of black blood on her arm. This blood had been coughed out by Nangong Longjian.</p><p>&#x201C;Longjian, your injuries have gotten more serious again?&#x201D; Bai Suyan felt extremely pained.</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. After all, sooner or later, I&#x2019;ll die,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian smiled lightly. It was as if he had already seen through life and death. Merely, there was still a trace of reluctance in his eyes. The reason for that was because there were people that he still yearned to be with. It was not only Bai Suyan, there was also Bai Ruochen.</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>The Asura Evil Spirit had escaped. It had escaped without any trace at all. The reason for that was because there had been no news of the Asura Evil Spirit willfully slaughtering the innocent after escaping from the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>As for the Nangong Imperial Clan, they had also blocked the news of the appearance of the Asura Evil Spirit and the destruction it had caused from spreading. After all, this was not a good piece of news. If this news were to spread, it would only cause them to be ridiculed by others.</p><p>However, the Nangong Imperial Clan did not plan to let Chu Feng escape. After careful consideration, they felt that Chu Feng was still alive. Even though they had already experienced how frightening that Asura Evil Spirit was, and already knew that Chu Feng was definitely not someone ordinary and could not be treated as a member of the younger generation, this only made them even more determined that they must eliminate Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng had been waiting outside of the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s territory the entire time. He was waiting for a piece of news.</p><p>However, after several days had passed, he had not managed to obtain any news at all. The Nangong Imperial Clan was extremely quiet; it was as if nothing had happened to the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>It was only when several groups of people from the Nangong Imperial Clan left their city and began to post wanted posters in the nearby cities that Chu Feng realized that the Nangong Imperial Clan had not been destroyed. Instead, they were very well off.</p><p>Else, they would not have the leisure to put out wanted posters. As for the person on their wanted posters, it was actually him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng? This Chu Feng, could he be the Chu Feng who defeated the Beitang Imperial Clan with his world spirit techniques at the Immortal Island?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be? Doesn&#x2019;t Chu Feng possess a very good relationship with the Nangong Imperial Clan? I heard that several days ago there were people who saw Chu Feng appearing from the teleportation formation with the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s young master and misses. Furthermore, he entered the Nangong Imperial Clan with them. On their way there, they were even chatting and laughing. It was as if he were going there to be a guest.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did he suddenly turn into the wanted criminal of the Nangong Imperial Clan? Could it be that he has done something that he shouldn&#x2019;t have in the Nangong Imperial Clan?&#x201D;</p><p>While other things in the Holy Land of Martialism did not spread fast, news spread extremely quickly. What Chu Feng had managed to accomplish in the past had been known by many people already.</p><p>When the wanted posters were posted, without Chu Feng himself being shocked, those people who knew of him were all shocked.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
