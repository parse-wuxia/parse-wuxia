<p><strong> Chapter 2455 - Remaining Calm</strong></p><p>Chu Feng looked around. After observing his surroundings, he discovered that this prison cell was truly remarkable. Likely, with the strength that he possessed right now, it would be very difficult to break free from that prison cell in a short period of time.</p><p>However, that would only hold true for a short period of time. After all, Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. As long as he was given sufficient time, he would definitely be able to break free from that prison cell.</p><p>&#x201C;Those despicable bastards, they actually repaid your kindness with malice. Chu Feng&#x2026; take out the Evil God Sword and kill them all. Else&#x2026; they will truly think that you are easily bullied.&#x201D;</p><p>Her Lady Queen was gnashing her teeth in anger. She was clenching her little fists so tightly that creaking sounds could be heard.</p><p>It seemed that she was truly enraged.</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly had a thought, and entered his world spirit space. As he saw Her Lady Queen before him, Chu feng revealed a faint smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Look at the situation, you&#x2019;ve been reduced to a prisoner now and are already at death&#x2019;s door. Yet you&#x2019;re still able to smile?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since when did your heart grow this magnanimous?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng remained calm even after all this, Her Lady Queen was even more furious.</p><p>However, the smile on Chu Feng&#x2019;s face grew even stronger. He said, &#x201C;The love Milady Queen has for me is truly deep. Every time I encounter a difficult situation, you will always be more nervous than me.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s little face instantly turned red. Then, she bit her lower lip with her pearly white teeth and revealed an even more furious expression. &#x201C;Pah! Damn shameless bastard, who said I love you? I merely do not want you to die because you&#x2019;ll cause me to die too if you do.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is that so? In that case, why was it that I saw someone so worried that she was about to cry when I was on the verge of failing to subdue the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Sword?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile on his face.</p><p>Her Lady Queen raised her chin in a very proud manner as he said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s because I didn&#x2019;t want to die. It is unrelated to you, okay?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Milady Queen, there&#x2019;s no need to bother explaining. I know everything,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a mischievous laugh. Furthermore, as he spoke, he began to walk toward Her Lady Queen.</p><p>&#x201C;If you dare continue with this, do you dare believe that even without that Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan killing you, I will exterminate you myself?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen revealed an angry look.</p><p>The very next moment, an oppressive might was emitted from her. That oppressive might actually forced Chu Feng into a corner.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng revealed a pleasantly surprised expression. He had a smile on his face as he looked at the fierce-looking little beauty before him, &#x201C;Rank two Martial Ancestor, and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Milady Queen, your cultivation has actually reached this level already?&#x201D; Chu Feng was very pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Before this, Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s cultivation had not been so powerful. Her battle power had also not been as frightening as it was now.</p><p>Likely, Her Lady Queen must&#x2019;ve gained her current level of cultivation after she refined the source energies of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals when Chu Feng was using the Evil God Sword to kill the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals.</p><p>Merely, Chu Feng did not expect that not only did Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s cultivation increase, but even her battle power had increased.</p><p>Right now, Chu Feng still only possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Even the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen that possessed their special War Clan&#x2019;s bloodline were only able to obtain a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation after reaching the Martial Ancestor level.</p><p>However, Her Lady Queen actually possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. As such, Chu Feng had no choice but to exclaim in admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Earlier, your power was sealed by the Evil God Sword. Thus, this Queen&#x2019;s cultivation was also sealed. I was so worried earlier that I forgot to inspect my own cultivation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Never would I have expected that I would be a rank two Martial Ancestor now. Furthermore, even my battle power has increased.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that the source energies of True Immortals are not only tasty, but also very useful. Haha,&#x201D; At that moment, Her Lady Queen was overjoyed.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, let this Queen out right away. I will personally teach that bunch of shameless Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen a lesson,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said excitedly.</p><p>She was extremely worried about Chu Feng&#x2019;s safety earlier. That was why she became so nervous and fretful.</p><p>However, she was now no longer that worried.</p><p>The always confident Her Lady Queen, upon finding out that her cultivation had increased to rank two Martial Ancestor, and her battle power had increased to being able to surmount five levels of cultivation, would naturally feel that she would be able to contend against the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>In fact, she wanted to go out right then and cause havoc throughout the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;No. Eggy, although you are very strong, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief is not weak either. I do not wish for you to take this risk,&#x201D; However, Chu Feng immediately refused her.</p><p>Although Her Lady Queen possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, a level above that of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief possessed a cultivation of rank four Martial Ancestor, two entire levels of cultivation above Her Lady Queen.</p><p>Thus, when judging from things as a whole, Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s battle power was a level weaker than the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>Furthermore, as the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was someone who had received the teachings of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan, Chu Feng had no idea what sort of abilities he might possess.</p><p>As such, Chu Feng would naturally not want Her Lady Queen to take the risk.</p><p>&#x201C;You should be able to tell that they&#x2019;re a bunch of useless trash. This Queen is not afraid of them,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if you&#x2019;re not afraid of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, you should still be on guard against Zhan Lingtong&#x2019;s grandfather.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That person was already a rank four Martial Ancestor before he entered closed-door training. Furthermore, he had been attempting a breakthrough the entire time. It might be possible that he&#x2019;s already a rank five Martial Ancestor now. Furthermore, he has grasped the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, one of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Three Great Secret Skills.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I really do not wish for you to fight against him,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What do we do then? Are we to resign ourselves to fate? If that&#x2019;s the case, that old fart might end up killing you after coming out of his closed-door training,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course we&#x2019;re not going to resign ourselves to fate. It is good that they treated me this way; like this, I can do what I want with no regard for them,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;So you already had a plan?&#x201D; After hearing what Chu Feng said, Her Lady Queen revealed a joyous look. She said, &#x201C;Quickly, tell me what you plan to do.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although I am a prisoner now, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan is evidently inferior to the Kong Heavenly Clan. As such, they have naturally not reached a level where I must use the Evil God Sword.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Most importantly, although my cultivation is inferior to theirs, I am, after all, an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. My world spirit techniques are evidently stronger than theirs.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although this prison cell is enchanted with powerful spirit formations which make it impossible for me to get out using regular techniques, I am still able to leave this prison cell should I use extraordinary methods.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t forget, even in the Kong Heavenly Clan, I was able to move about unconstrained,&#x201D; Chu Feng said confidently.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re saying that you plan to set up the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, I&#x2019;m going to set up the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since they&#x2019;re not planning to kill me for the time being, I am able to spend some time setting up the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation to leave this place.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not only do I plan to leave this prison cell, but I am also going to find that Martial Comprehension Ground. Since I&#x2019;ve come, I will not return empty-handed,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Good, it&#x2019;s decided then,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait,&#x201D; Suddenly, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes narrowed.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems like someone&#x2019;s here,&#x201D; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he cast his awareness back into his body.</p><p>Sure enough, Chu Feng discovered that the entrance to the prison cell was being opened by someone.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Soon, the prison cell was opened, and a figure hurriedly ran in.</p><p>Merely, Chu Feng did not show any fear upon seeing that individual. Instead, he was very surprised. The reason for that was because that individual was not the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, or one of their elders.</p><p>Rather, it was Zhan Lingling.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
