<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1791 - Two Divine Powers</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you can&#x2019;t escape.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, like Baili Xinghe, Leng Yue thought that Chu Feng was trying to escape. She hurriedly moved the rod in her hand and came chasing after Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, not bad,&#x201D; However, while standing in the distance, Chu Feng did not have the intention to dodge. Instead, he was staring at Leng Yue&#x2019;s body and laughing heartily. Furthermore, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze was extremely strange and wicked.</p><p>This situation caused Leng Yue to feel very uncomfortable. Involuntarily, she looked to herself.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhhh~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Once she saw her body, Leng Yue immediately cried out in alarm. Then, panic covered her face. She was surprised to discover that she was currently completely naked. The clothes that she was wearing were all gone. Just like that, she had revealed her everything to Chu Feng.</p><p>After discovering that the situation was bad, Leng Yue immediately used her world spirit power to create clothes to cover her naked body.</p><p>Then, she subconsciously turned her gaze onto Chu Feng and Baili Xinghe. Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s gaze was still fixed onto her body. That&#x2019;s right. His gaze was on her body and not her face. Furthermore, the precise location of his gaze was at a very shameful location.</p><p>She had been seen, all of her had been seen. Even though she had covered herself, it was already too late. Everything had already been seen.</p><p>Shame. Enormous shame. To women, the most important thing was their chastity. Especially for a woman like Leng Yue, who did not place any of the men in the world in her eyes, she held her chastity in even greater importance.</p><p>She felt that, in the entire Holy Land of Martialism, other than the Five Emperors that were already dead, there were no other men who could suit her, there was no one qualified to see her jade body.</p><p>Yet, today, her jade body had been completely seen. As such, how could she accept this?</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#x201D; At this moment, Leng Yue shouted. Her voice caused space to tremble. All of her unreconciliation, shame and anger was present in her scream.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you did that!!!!&#x201D; Suddenly, Leng Yue cast her ice-cold gaze onto Chu Feng. She suddenly remembered what had happened earlier.</p><p>Earlier, Chu Feng had unleashed an exceptionally fierce sword technique at her. Not only had that sword technique been very profound, it had also caught her off guard. She had had no choice but to put forth all of her strength to block Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack.</p><p>Originally, she had thought that she would be injured. However, not only was she not injured, Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack became slower and slower. Then, Chu Feng suddenly distanced himself from the battle. Then, the thing from earlier happened.</p><p>It was only now that she realized that Chu Feng&#x2019;s sword technique was not meant to injure her. Rather, it was meant to disgrace her. Using that sharp sword technique, Chu Feng had cut apart all of her clothes, leaving her completely naked.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you shameless bastard, I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D; It was all because of Chu Feng that her naked body was seen by two men. As such, Leng Yue was unable to contain her anger. In fury, she turned into a hundred-meter-long silver sword that pierced at Chu Feng.</p><p>Leng Yue had unleashed an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill from the Heavenly Law Palace. Its might was extremely strong. She managed to directly cut through the enormous void in the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation,&#x201D; Seeing that Leng Yue had unleashed a powerful martial skill, Chu Feng did not dare to underestimate her. Without hesitation, he unleashed the five elements of wind, lightning, water, fire and earth. The five elements interweaved with one another and turned into an enormous compass that surrounded Chu Feng within it.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The sword that Leng Yue turned into had arrived. It was trying to pierce through Chu Feng&#x2019;s compass. However, when the sword and the compass collided, they were withstanding one another. For now, Leng Yue was unable to injure Chu Feng.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng said with a very serious expression, &#x201C;Leng Yue, I was merely playing a joke earlier. Calm yourself first. I have a very important matter that I need to tell you,&#x201D;</p><p>While Leng Yue was extremely angry at this moment and possessed overflowing killing intent toward Chu Feng, she was startled to discover that Chu Feng had removed his smiles, and spoken those words with a very serious expression. Thus, she asked, &#x201C;What is it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although you&#x2019;re ugly, your figure is exceptionally good.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe,&#x201D; After finishing those words, Chu Feng revealed an extremely shameless smile on his face. Furthermore, he began to run his shameless gaze all over Leng Yue&#x2019;s body again.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I, Leng Yue, will definitely kill you today!!!&#x201D; Leng Yue was so enraged that her heart was twitching and her soul was trembling with anger. She began to continue to unleash attacks at Chu Feng with the intention to break apart Chu Feng&#x2019;s Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation. She wanted to hack Chu Feng into eight pieces in order to alleviate the anger in her heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Aiyo, not bad, not bad. This is what I was looking for. Only by acting like this do you resemble the number one disciple of the Heavenly Law Palace.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I bet it would be an even better thing to watch if you were naked while you were angry. Come, strip for this gentleman again.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body shifted. He had separated himself from his Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation and reached behind Leng Yue.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>As light flickered, Chu Feng swung the Heavenly Immortal Sword, unleashing the same sharp Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique from before to attack Leng Yue.</p><p>As for the sword that Leng Yue had turned into, it had managed to pierce deep into Chu Feng&#x2019;s Earthen Taboo: Five Elements Formation, and was currently stuck. She was simply unable to escape, and could only watch as Chu Feng&#x2019;s attacks reached her.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Leng Yue&#x2019;s expression changed greatly. In this moment of desperation, blue lightning flashed through her eyes. Then, the weather began to change. Several lightning bolts shot from her body and toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Pa, pa, pa, pa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The lightning bolts had come too suddenly. Furthermore, they were extremely powerful. Chu Feng couldn&#x2019;t ignore them. Thus, he ended up using the Heavenly Immortal Sword to block them.</p><p>That said, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Heavenly Immortal Sword was even stronger. After blocking the incoming lightning bolts, Chu Feng continued onward to attack Leng Yue.</p><p>The lightning had been unable to stop Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Huuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, like a whistling gale, Leng Yue&#x2019;s Divine Power came sweeping toward Chu Feng.</p><p>The combination of the violent wind with the lightning bolts instantly increased their overall strength. Even though Chu Feng possessed the Heavenly Immortal Sword, he was still only able to barely block them.</p><p>&#x201C;That girl, is actually this powerful?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng was frowning deeply. He had noticed that something was amiss the moment the lightning bolts had appeared. At this moment, he had confirmed his guess.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked loudly, &#x201C;Leng Yue, you actually possess two Divine Powers?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>The moment when the lightning bolts appeared, Chu Feng had discovered that their power was extremely special. It was not an ordinary martial skill. Instead, it was Divine Power.</p><p>However, upon recalling how Leng Yue had already revealed her Divine Power, Chu Feng became puzzled. After all, it was impossible for one person to possess two Divine powers.</p><p>At the very least, he had never heard of such a thing before.</p><p>However, at this moment, Chu Feng was certain that Leng Yue possessed two Divine Powers. Both the wind and the lightning were Divine Powers. He was certain about that.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, you&#x2019;re quite sharp. Among my fellow younger generation, you are the first to force me to reveal my Heavenly Lightning Divine Power.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I might as well tell you this. All those who have seen me use these two Divine Powers simultaneously have been killed by me.&#x201D;</p><p>After Leng Yue said those words, her lightning Divine Power and wind Divine Power fused together. Within wind, lightning. Within lightning, wind. Its might was boundlessly powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After the wind and lightning fused with one another, they surged toward Chu Feng like an enormous dragon of wind and lightning.</p><p>Not only was that attack extremely powerful, it was filled with killing intent. Leng Yue was not lying. She was truly planning to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Divine Powers. They&#x2019;re really two Divine Powers. How could this be?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How could a single person possess two Divine Powers?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, she has grasped these two Divine Powers this skillfully, and has actually managed to ingeniously fuse them together to increase their might?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, as Baili Xinghe looked to Leng Yue in the sky, he revealed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
