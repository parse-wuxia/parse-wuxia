<p><strong> Chapter 2521 - I&#x2019;m Determined to Take His Life</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it is one thing for you to have killed Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk after they provoked you earlier.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I, Zhou Fukong, have not done anything to you. Are you really planning to have that demonic woman kill me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, you have already made enemies of the Kong Heavenly Clan, the Immortal Sword School and Buddha&#x2019;s Heavenly Temple.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you are to kill me, you would be making an enemy of our Zhou Heavenly Clan too. At that time, you will really end up&#x2026;&#x201D; Zhou Fukong realized that it would not do to use force, and thus could only try to continue to talk things out.</p><p>&#x201C;Puu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, before Zhou Fukong could finish his words, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe in the sky suddenly came down, piercing through his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuahh.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Fukong let out a miserable scream and he instantly despaired.</p><p>At the moment the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe pierced through his body, he felt an extremely powerful oppressive sensation.</p><p>That oppressive sensation was naturally from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe.</p><p>If Zhou Fukong was able to barely put up a fight against Chu Feng before, then, now that his body had been pierced through by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, he had completely lost the ability to fight against Chu Feng.</p><p>Not to mention Chu Feng, any one of the people present would be able to easily take his life.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s best that you don&#x2019;t move around. Else, if my Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe is to move slightly lower, it will hack your body in two. At that time&#x2026; when your Zhou Heavenly Clan comes to retrieve your corpse, they will not be able to retrieve an intact corpse,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Zhou Fukong.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou Fukong was so furious that he felt as if his heart, liver, spleen and lungs were about to explode. The meaning of Chu Feng&#x2019;s words were extremely obvious. Chu Feng was telling him that he, Zhou Fukong, would definitely die.</p><p>In truth, Zhou Fukong did indeed feel that he would die there. The reason for that was because that demonic woman Zhao Hong was rushing toward him murderously.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Hong, go ahead,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Zhao Hong.</p><p>Zhao Hong did not hesitate. She raised her palm and planned to take Zhou Fukong&#x2019;s life.</p><p>&#x201C;Stay your hand!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard.</p><p>After that voice was heard, space itself started to tremble. Even Chu Feng&#x2019;s oppressive might, those black clouds of lightning that filled the region, were trembling.</p><p>&#x201C;This aura, it&#x2019;s a True Immortal?&#x201D; At that moment, the surrounding crowd were all alarmed. They were able to sense the person that had arrived was a True Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, come, kill me. That is our Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Elder Zhou Yuluo!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Zhou Fukong burst into loud laughter. His laughter was filled with pride and provocation.</p><p>The reason for that was because he knew that his life had been saved.</p><p>Not only would his life be saved, but the two people before him, those two people that had tormented him miserably, would end up suffering greatly.</p><p>&#x201C;True Immortal?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng also felt the aura of that True Immortal. Inevitably, he started to feel apprehension in his heart.</p><p>Based on the True Immortals that he had encountered so far, he was able to tell that the True Immortal that came here was merely a rank one True Immortal.</p><p>However, even though his opponent was only a rank one True Immortal, his opponent&#x2019;s aura still firmly surpassed his own.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng was a Heavenly Bloodline possessor, even though he possessed the Divine Mark and the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Axe, even if he currently surpassed all Martial Ancestors, it remained that when he was faced with an actual rank one True Immortal, he was able to feel how inferior he was by comparison.</p><p>True Immortals were True Immortals. They were in a realm of cultivation that no Martial Ancestor could match up against regardless of how powerful they might be.</p><p>This enormous gap was something that not even Heavenly Bloodline possessors could breach.</p><p>When Chu Feng was a peak Martial Emperor, he was able to rely on his Heavenly Bloodline&#x2019;s power to temporarily increase his cultivation to the peak Half Martial Ancestor realm.</p><p>However, when he became a peak Martial Ancestor, even though his Heavenly Bloodline&#x2019;s power would still be present, even though he would have grasped many more heaven-defying methods, he would never be able to increase his cultivation to the True Immortal realm.</p><p>This was the greatness of True Immortals. Unless one were to truly reach True Immortal realm through cultivation, no ability would allow one to become a True Immortal.</p><p>Thus, regardless of how powerful Chu Feng might be at moment, regardless of how heaven-defying his battle power might be, he remained a Martial Ancestor.</p><p>As long as he was a Martial Ancestor, he would not be able to withstand a True Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, why would a True Immortal come now?&#x201D;</p><p>Zhao Hong also realized that the situation was amiss. Thus, her raised palm never landed.</p><p>She knew very well that since that True Immortal&#x2019;s oppressive might had already covered the region, this meant that True Immortal had already arrived. As such, she no longer possessed the opportunity to kill Zhou Fukong.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, Zhao Hong, what enormous nerves you have!&#x201D;</p><p>That furious shout was heard once again. Merely, this time around, that voice was closer and more resounding.</p><p>At the moment that voice sounded, without even mentioning how powerful that True Immortal&#x2019;s oppressive might was, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were able to feel intense sound waves crashing into them, making them unable to stand firm.</p><p>However, Zhou Fukong who stood beside them was not affected in the slightest.</p><p>The other bystanders present also did not feel anything.</p><p>Evidently, that sound wave was aimed at Chu Feng and Zhao Hong only.</p><p>After that voice landed, two figures appeared.</p><p>The person standing at the front was a nearly two meter tall middle-aged man.</p><p>This man was very robust, and possessed a stubby beard. He had a very prominent &#x2018;uncle&#x2019; appearance.</p><p>Especially his pair of deep eyes. They allowed one to know that he had experienced countless years, seen countless people, and encountered countless things.</p><p>This man was an old monster that had lived for a very long time. He was most definitely not a middle-aged man like his appearance suggested.</p><p>At that moment, that man was looking at Chu Feng and Zhao Hong with a very ill-intended gaze. It could even be said that his gaze was filled with murderous intent.</p><p>It was as if, if Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were to make any movements that dissatisfied him, he would immediately act to kill them.</p><p>The overwhelming True Immortal&#x2019;s aura was coming from this man. Likely&#x2026; this man was that Elder Zhou Yuluo that Zhou Fukong spoke of.</p><p>However, apart from Zhou Yuluo, there was another individual. That person was wearing a special conical bamboo hat. His conical bamboo hat was so special that even Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were unable to see through it.</p><p>However, judging from his appearance, he was most likely an old man.</p><p>Furthermore, he did not try to especially alter his appearance. Thus, his facial appearance should likely also be that of an old man.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Soon, that individual took off his conical bamboo hat and revealed his facial appearance.</p><p>Sure enough, it was a white-haired old man. He possessed a dark complexion and had a horse-shaped face. However, his eyes were bright and full of expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>Merely upon meeting that individual&#x2019;s eyes, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong realized that individual to be an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>Zhao Hong was surprised. Even though that world spiritist was clearly on Zhou Yuluo&#x2019;s side, that old man was looking at them with a gaze without anger. Instead, it was filled with surprise and unease.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s him?&#x201D;</p><p>As for Chu Feng, his gaze changed.</p><p>Chu Feng had met this old man once before. It was when Chu Feng was using his Evil God Sword to battle against the Kong Heavenly Clan two years ago. At that time, that old man was present.</p><p>Chu Feng faintly remembered that someone had addressed the old man as Zhuge Mingren. And he&#x2026; was indeed an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Moreover, he was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he was a very reputed individual.</p><p>This Zhuge Mingren was one of the most important witnesses to Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle against the Kong Heavenly Clan two years ago.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, Zhao Hong, are the two of you not going to explain what is going on here today?&#x201D; Zhou Yuluo questioned. His tone was very ill-intended.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhao Hong did not plan to explain. Instead, she grabbed Chu Feng&#x2019;s arm and urged him to leave.</p><p>She was no fool. When this True Immortal appeared, she knew that their absolute dominance had been turned around.</p><p>If they were to continue to draw this on, the ones to suffer would be them.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not move. Instead, he pulled back Zhao Hong, who was planning to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Zhao Hong revealed a confused expression. She didn&#x2019;t understand why Chu Feng wasn&#x2019;t leaving.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he smiled at Zhao Hong, and then said, &#x201C;Even if we are to leave, we should finish what we need to do first.&#x201D;</p><p>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he turned to Zhou Yuluo and said, &#x201C;I have nothing to explain to you. However, there is one thing that I can tell you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, I am determined to take Zhou Fukong&#x2019;s life.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
