<p><strong> Chapter 2144 - Disappointing Result</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Step~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Step~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng took two more successive steps. After those two steps, he arrived on the fifth step.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng was already sweating profusely, and his complexion had turned pale. The pressure was even harder to withstand than he had anticipated. The pain was even more painful than he had anticipated.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not stop. His foot moved upward. Once again, he took two successive steps and arrived on the seventh step.</p><p>The seventh step was something that extremely few people in the Chu Heavenly Clan managed to reach. All those that reached the seventh step would be deemed dragons among men, and be respected by everyone. Even those with status in the Chu Heavenly Clan did not dare to neglect the members of the younger generation that managed to reach the seventh step.</p><p>After all, even the current Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had only reached the seventh step.</p><p>However, that was not Chu Feng&#x2019;s goal. Chu Feng raised his foot with great difficulty and stepped onto the eighth step.</p><p>&#x201C;Step~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Success. Chu Feng successfully stepped onto the eighth step. He had surpassed the Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s current Clan Chief and countless others.</p><p>After all, only three people had ever stepped foot onto the eighth step in the history of the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p><p>They were his grandfather, Chu Hanxian.</p><p>His father, Chu Xuanyuan.</p><p>And the Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s ancestor, Chu Yetianhong.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had a goal from the very beginning. That goal of his was not the eighth step. Instead, it was the ninth step.</p><p>Chu Feng wanted to reach the same height as his grandfather and his father. Else, he would feel that he had disgraced his grandfather and father&#x2019;s reputations, and brought dishonor upon the inheritance from his father.</p><p>Thinking about that, Chu Feng clenched his teeth and began to move his right foot that was still on the seventh step. The right foot of his did not stop on the eighth step. Instead, it began to proceed toward the ninth step directly.</p><p>&#x201C;Step~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, Chu Feng&#x2019;s foot landed. However, it did not land on the ninth step. Instead, it landed on the eighth step.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s legs were trembling violently. It was as if he was on the verge of losing balance, as if he would collapse at any moment.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s physical appearance was still relatively better off than what he was feeling. The pain brought forth by the eight lightning bolts were simply not something that ordinary people could withstand.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s lips had turned purple. He felt powerless from head to toe. He did not even have the strength to move a single step. Furthermore, as the ninth step contained enormous pressure, it would be extremely difficult for Chu Feng to step onto it.</p><p>&#x201C;Feng&#x2019;er, do not force yourself,&#x201D; Right at that moment, Chu Xuanyuan&#x2019;s voice sounded. He was able to determine that Chu Feng had reached his limit.</p><p>As for Zi Ling, the Old Ape and the blind old man, none of them dared to say anything because they were afraid that they would affect Chu Feng. As such, they could only gaze at Chu Feng with worried expressions.</p><p>After hearing his father&#x2019;s voice, even though Chu Feng was clearly unable to take another step forward, he suddenly felt as if all the blood his body was boiling and surging. He suddenly felt that there was a strong surge of power in him.</p><p>Thus, with his left foot on the eighth step, Chu Feng began to lift his right foot and stride toward the ninth step.</p><p>&#x201C;Step~~~&#x201D;</p><p>It landed. Chu Feng&#x2019;s right foot landed onto the ninth step. He had successfully ascended to the ninth step.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right after Chu Feng&#x2019;s right foot landed onto the ninth step, he let out a loud shout. It was a painful scream.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Following that, a loud sound was emitted from the ninth step. Like an arrow that was shot out from a bow, Chu Feng was knocked flying.</p><p>However, even though Chu Feng started to fly, he was not shot off. Instead, he started to float over the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.</p><p>After that, the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps let out nine lightning bolts that charged to attack Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Crap!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that, Chu Xuanyuan&#x2019;s expression changed. His body immediately shifted, and he flew toward the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At the moment Chu Xuanyuan approached, the nine lightning bolts that had shot out from the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps turned into nine enormous lightning beasts that moved to ferociously attack Chu Xuanyuan.</p><p>Although those nine enormous lightning beasts were not as astonishing as those from the Heavenly Bloodline&#x2019;s abnormal sign, their might was still unstoppable. Their power already surpassed that of Half Martial Ancestors.</p><p>&#x201C;Scatter!&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Xuanyuan waved his sleeve. Immediately, space itself started to tremble as golden ripples appeared. The nine enormous lightning beasts turned into countless rays of lightning that scattered in all directions before exploding.</p><p>Then, Chu Xuanyuan extended his hand and grabbed. Chu Feng was grabbed by him. His body shifted, and he brought Chu Feng back to the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After Chu Feng and Chu Xuanyuan landed on the ground, the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps also shattered. The frightening aura from before disappeared completely.</p><p>At that moment, what remained of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was a pile of shattered glass. There was nothing special about it anymore.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng,&#x201D; At that moment, Zi Ling, the Old Ape and the blind old man all rushed toward Chu Feng with worried expressions on their faces.</p><p>Snapping sounds were being emitted from Chu Feng&#x2019;s body nonstop. Those were sounds of bones shattering.</p><p>In fact, it was not only his bones that shattered. Chu Feng&#x2019;s muscles, veins and organs were all shattered as well.</p><p>However, after being treated by Chu Xuanyuan, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body was soon restored to what it was before. His ugly expression also returned to being rosy. In fact, he appeared even more energetic than before.</p><p>&#x201C;Feng&#x2019;er, you&#x2019;re too reckless,&#x201D; said Chu Xuanyuan after seeing that Chu Feng was fine.</p><p>However, Chu Feng suddenly knelt onto the ground with an expression of self-blame. &#x201C;Father, I am useless. I have shamed you.&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Chu Feng had also managed to reach the ninth step, he had been unable to stand firmly on the ninth step. Thus, Chu Feng knew very well that his final record was only that of the eighth step.</p><p>&#x201C;Shamed me? In the entire Chu Heavenly Clan, how many people were able to reach the eighth step?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not to mention the current Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation, even counting past results, only a few people were able to accomplish that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, my Feng&#x2019;er has accomplished that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Feng&#x2019;er, you have not shamed me. Instead, you have brought honor to me,&#x201D; Chu Xuanyuan helped Chu Feng back up with a smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng still had an expression of self-blame on his face.</p><p>The way he saw it, his failure in attaining the same height as his father and grandfather meant that he had tarnished the bloodline that he had inherited from them, and brought dishonor upon their reputations.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that their powerful bloodlines had entered a decline when they reached him.</p><p>&#x201C;Feng&#x2019;er, I&#x2019;ve said it before. That is only a test, and cannot represent one&#x2019;s final strength.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Throughout history, there were many people with great results from the test that ended up with mediocre accomplishments.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, there were also many that only managed to reach the third step, but ended up attaining very high accomplishments.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A test remains only a test. On the path of martial cultivation, while one&#x2019;s talent is very important, one&#x2019;s investments and efforts are equally important.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do not forget this. Regardless of whether it is your grandfather or I, neither one of us are able to replace Chu Yetianhong in the hearts of the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Chu Yetianhong is the person with the greatest accomplishments, and the person who contributed the most to our Chu Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, our ancestor is our Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s greatest pride,&#x201D; Chu Xuanyuan said.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
