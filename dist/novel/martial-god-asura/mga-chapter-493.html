<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 493 - Terrifying Huge Bird</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Interesting. I didn&#x2019;t expect that someone would have a World Spirit from the Asura Spirit World in a desolate place like this. And it&#x2019;s even a brat with only the cultivation of the 8th level of the Profound realm.&#x201D; The black-robed old man swept his gaze over Eggy and Chu Feng, and unconcernedly said.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Chu Feng couldn&#x2019;t help but be shocked. He clearly used the power of the two lightning and raised his cultivation to the 1st level of the Heaven realm, but that old man actually saw through his fake cultivation, and knew that his real cultivation was the 8th level of the Profound realm.</span></p><p><span style="">In addition, Chu Feng felt a threatening feeling that he had never felt before from the old man as well as an unfathomably deep cultivation. He determined that the old man was an extraordinary expert, possibly even an expert in the Martial Lord realm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me see what&#x2019;s so special about a brat like you.&#x201D; Suddenly, the old man&#x2019;s gaze changed and he actually headed towards Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Old bastard, move, or else don&#x2019;t blame me for not holding myself back.&#x201D; Seeing that, Eggy&#x2019;s face changed as she explosively yelled. Simultaneously, vast black-coloured gas burst out from her body. When the black-coloured gas appeared, cries similar to those of wolves and ghosts immediately sounded. It was extremely terrifying.</span></p><p><span style="">But even with such horrifying black-coloured gas, the black-clothed old man&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t change. Rather, he indifferently smiled and said, &#x201C;Not bad. This level of battle power belongs to the noble bloodline of Asura World Spirits. It is really quite rare.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">And as he spoke, a layer of golden radiance suddenly spread out from his body. Not only did it stop Eggy&#x2019;s black-coloured flames, it actually also rapidly pressed it back. Afterwards, the golden radiance became a huge net and in only an instant, it forced the black-coloured gas back into Eggy&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Gold-coloured Spirit Formation power? You&#x2019;re a Gold-cloak World Spiritist?!&#x201D; Chu Feng was endlessly shocked because he already recognized the golden radiance. It was gold-coloured Spirit Formation power that only Gold-cloak World Spiritists could use.</span></p><p><span style="">A Purple-cloak World Spiritist could already be called a legend in the continent of the Nine Provinces. A Gold-cloak World Spiritist would be a legend within legends. That person was actually a Gold-cloak World Spiritist, which meant that most likely, he wasn&#x2019;t a person from the continent of the Nine Provinces and was indeed, an extraordinary expert.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Not bad, you have some observation skills.&#x201D; Suddenly, the old man&#x2019;s voice rang out behind Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears. In that instant, Chu Feng also astonishedly discovered that the black-clothed old man who was originally nearby disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But when Chu Feng turned around, he saw a big hand already approaching him and had pressed onto his chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh~~~~&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The old man&#x2019;s speed was really too quick. When Chu Feng saw his hand, his palm had already tightly grabbed onto his own chest. At the same time, layers of strange power also entered his body and started to scurry everywhere inside Chu Feng&#x2019;s body, seemingly trying to search for something.</span></p><p><span style="">He was actually searching Chu Feng&#x2019;s body, looking for what was special about Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm?&#x201D; However, when the strange power prepared to enter Chu Feng&#x2019;s dantian, the black-clothed old man&#x2019;s face suddenly changed greatly. Quickly after, he hurriedly let go of the hand which was grabbing Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, the gaze he looked at Chu Feng with became very complicated. He mumbled to himself, &#x201C;Unexpected, unexpected! In such a desolate place, such an unsimple brat actually appeared!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Whatever, whatever. It is really rare for a brat like you to appear in a place like this. Today, I shall spare your life.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, the black-clothed old man suddenly waved his big sleeve, then the surrounding flames started to rapidly extinguish. With only a blink, the vast ocean of fire that took over several mountains completely disappeared. It became rolling dense smoke, and at the same time, the black-clothed old man also disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So these are the methods of a Gold-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D; Chu Feng looked at the ground which was pitch-black and gave off bursts of heat. He felt endless shock in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, quickly look at this!&#x201D; But just at that time, Eggy cried out in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="">Turning his head to look, Chu Feng astonishedly discovered that an enormous huge thing appeared in the distance. It was a huge bird.</span></p><p><span style="">That bird was extremely huge. So huge that its body was as big as a small hill. Its entire body&#x2019;s feathers were golden. They were glittering and shining, and were very blinding.</span></p><p><span style="">However, although the bird had a very beautiful appearance, many places on its body were dangerous weapons. Within its huge mouth, there were pointed teeth. Even every single feather was an indestructible sharp blade.</span></p><p><span style="">But sadly, at that very instant, the terrifying huge bird did not have the aura of life, but on its enormous body, frightening flames still lingered around, scuttering everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="">The flames were the same flames from the ocean of fire before, which meant that the flames weren&#x2019;t made by the black-clothed old man but by the terrifying huge bird.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, impressive! This is a Monstrous Beast that truly has special blood. It is a truly powerful Monstrous Beast, fated to become a king of Monstrous Beasts when it was born!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;When something like the five big Monster Kings of the Thousand Monster Mountain, or even your big brother, that little monkey butt, is compared to this Monstrous Beast, they are so insanely weak.&#x201D; At that instant, Eggy was unendingly excited. She madly ran towards the huge bird with skips and jumps.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that, Chu Feng also hurriedly went over, deeply afraid of the appearance of any change and that Eggy would meet danger.</span></p><p><span style="">But after Chu Feng neared the terrifying huge bird, even more so, he felt that he was endlessly minuscule. In front of it, Chu Feng was truly as minuscule as an ant. He felt like a Monstrous Beast wasn&#x2019;t in front of him, but a small hill.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit, dammit! Its Source energy has been absorbed. It was even absorbed so cleanly! Or else, with this Monstrous Beast&#x2019;s Source energy, it would have definitely made my cultivation rise greatly and I would have been able to continuously make breakthroughs for many levels. Dammit. Dammit!&#x201D; Suddenly, Eggy started to yell as she was filled with resentment.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Chu Feng also discovered that the terrifying huge bird&#x2019;s Source energy was indeed cleanly consumed and not even a trace remained.</span></p><p><span style="">Without much thinking, Chu Feng knew who did that. It was definitely the black-clothed old man just now.</span></p><p><span style="">He was a Gold-cloak World Spiritist, so he undoubtedly made many contracts with many powerful World Spirits. It was probable that the huge bird was killed by him, and the reason he killed the huge bird was very simple as well. To absorb its Source energy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! In this world, there is actually such a huge bird?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that time, when Zhang Tianyi, Jiang Hengyuan, Qi Fengyang, Gao Qizhi, Zi Ling, and the others saw the ocean of fire extinguished, all of them returned and came up to the huge bird. Their faces were filled with shock as they observed in detail. Because, no matter who it was in their group, it was the first time they saw such an enormous Monstrous Beast.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, what has happened here? Was the ocean of fire extinguished by you?&#x201D; Jiang Hengyuan came to Chu Feng&#x2019;s side and asked with a face filled with amazement.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng thought for a while, but at the end, he didn&#x2019;t plan to tell him the truth. He feigned being at a loss as he shook his head and said, &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t me. It extinguished itself. Perhaps because this huge bird was living before so the flames lived along with it, and since it has died now, the ocean of fire has also been extinguished.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
