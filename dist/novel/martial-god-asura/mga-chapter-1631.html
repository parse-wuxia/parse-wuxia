<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1631 - The Appearance Of The Divine Lightnings</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong? You&#x2019;re talking about that that bunch of Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s dogs who are barking outside nonstop? Did something happen?&#x201D; Eggy had also managed to hear the sound of the Nangong Imperial Clansmen outside. She asked him because she thought that what Chu Feng meant by something wrong might be that.</p><p>&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s the six Divine Lightnings which are acting weird.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if they must leave my body in order to create an abnormal sign, they shouldn&#x2019;t have left my body for this long. Logically, they should have returned to my body already.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I feel that not only do they not have the intention to return my body, their desire to rush out of this spirit formation has become even stronger,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Now that you speak of it, that&#x2019;s true. Earlier, they seemed to have gradually calmed down. However, ever since those people from the Nangong Imperial Clan started to shout inconsiderately, they became even more excited and even frantic at that. Could it be that the shouting from the Nangong Imperial Clan has angered them?&#x201D; After hearing what Chu Feng said, Eggy also discovered that something was wrong.</p><p>After hearing what Eggy said, Chu Feng used his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes to look outside. When he saw the golden dragon that was spiraling through the skies, his expression immediately changed. He said, &#x201C;Oh no!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; Eggy was not in Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. Thus, she could not see what Chu Feng had seen.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a golden dragon outside that is emitting Imperial Bloodline energy. Likely, someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan has reached a breakthrough and triggered an abnormal sign in the form of that golden dragon.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for my Inherited Bloodline, it is more powerful than that golden dragon. Likely, my bloodline is unable to stand an existence weaker than them strutting around outside while they are trapped here. That&#x2019;s why they have gotten angry.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If my guess is correct, they want to go out and take care of that golden dragon,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you kidding? If that&#x2019;s the case, the situation is extremely bad. What do we do? Is there a way to have your Divine Lightnings return to your body?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuuaoouu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, the six Divine Lightnings roared simultaneously. Then, they released enormously powerful auras and began to pound against Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation.</p><p>Being pounded against by those six Divine Lightnings in such a frantic manner, Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation that had been able to completely contain them before actually started to sway left and right. It had the appearance of breaking at any moment.</p><p>Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng immediately placed his hands onto the spirit formation and started to pour his spirit power into his spirit formation to increase its strength.</p><p>However, as his spirit formation became stronger, the power of the six Divine Lightnings also became stronger and stronger. Furthermore, they had started to pound against Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation more frantically.</p><p>Seeing that his spirit formation was about to crumble, Chu Feng&#x2019;s complexion turned deathly pale. Knowing that the situation was extremely bad, he blurted out, &#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>The people from the Nangong Imperial Clan did not know what was happening at Chu Feng&#x2019;s residence. Above the building constructed at the peak of the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s mountain range, the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, the White-browed Immortal and the others were all standing there.</p><p>From where they were standing, they were able to watch that dazzling golden dragon shuttling through the clouds at an extremely close range.</p><p>They had finally managed to see the abnormal sign that they wished to see, the soaring golden dragon. White-browed Immortal and the other world spiritists all had their brows raised in delight and eyes laughing as they beamed in joy.</p><p>&#x201C;What a magnificent sight. It is truly stunning. This abnormal sign is simply the most spectacular of all abnormal signs I&#x2019;ve seen in my life,&#x201D; At this moment, many of the world spiritists were praising it nonstop.</p><p>&#x201C;The intensity of the abnormal sign is generally a sign signaling the intensity of one&#x2019;s strength. This abnormal sign is simply the most valiant of all abnormal signs I&#x2019;ve seen in my lifetime.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Imperial Bloodline is truly exceptional. In my opinion, it is as Clan Chief Nangong had said, regardless of how powerful Divine Bodies might be, even if they receive the favor of the heavens, they will still not be able to compare with the Imperial Bloodline of the Nangong Imperial Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For the Nangong Imperial Clan to possess this sort of Inherited Bloodline, it is truly unreasonable for them to not become the strongest among humans,&#x201D; Even White-browed Immortal started to praise it.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026; no rush, no rush. With Brother White-brow helping me, how could our Nangong Imperial Clan possibly not rise in power?&#x201D; After hearing what White-browed Immortal said, that Nangong Beidou started to grin from ear to ear.</p><p>From his words, one could tell that he was not willing to be inferior to the Three Palaces and be on equal footing to the other Three Imperial Clans. He possessed ambition. As for that ambition, it was to become the strongest among humans.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuaouu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, a roar sounded from below. When that roar was heard, the entire world started to tremble violently. That roar was a lot more frightening than the roar from the golden dragon earlier.</p><p>At this moment, everyone&#x2019;s expressions changed. They turned their gazes to Nangong Beidou and asked, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Could it be that someone else has reached a breakthrough today?&#x201D;</p><p>However, at this moment, Nangong Beidou was frowning deeply. He knew the most about the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Inherited Bloodline. Even though that roar sounded very similar to the golden dragon&#x2019;s roar, he knew that it was definitely not their Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s abnormal sign, the golden dragon. Likely, someone else had mixed in.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuaouu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, that roar sounded once again. This time around, it was not only a single roar. Rather, six roars sounded together.</p><p>At the same time the six roars sounded, six enormous beasts with lightning covering their entire bodies soared into the sky and arrived above the clouds.</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens, what are those?!&#x201D;</p><p>After seeing those six enormous lightning beasts, White-browed Immortal and the others started to panic. Those six enormous lightning beats were simply too immense. It could be said that each of them was many times larger than that golden dragon. Even though they possessed indefinite appearances, they were still extremely frightening monsters.</p><p>If they were only enormous and possessed frightening appearances, they would not be that scary.</p><p>However, most importantly, those six enormous lightning beasts were emitting auras that caused even White-browed Immortal to feel extremely uneasy.</p><p>Before those six enormous lightning beasts, White-browed Immortal felt a single sensation. That sensation could be described with two words: weak and small.</p><p>Before those six enormous lightning beasts, he felt extremely weak and small. Even though he was a Martial Emperor, even though he was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, he still knew that those enormous lightning beasts were a lot more frightening than him. In his entire life, he had never seen existences that frightening.</p><p>When even White-browed Immortal, an outsider, felt this way, there was no need to mention what the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan felt.</p><p>In the instant those six enormous lightning beasts appeared, their souls immediately started to tremble. Especially their Inherited Bloodlines in their dantians, they were shivering with fear.</p><p>In fact, for many who possessed weak cultivations, they actually started to tremble violently. As for the young children, they even started to wail. They were deeply frightened.</p><p>This caused the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan to feel extremely uneasy. That was because this sort of sensation was something that they had never felt before. However, they were all certain that this sensation that they were feeling was caused by those six enormous lightning beasts.</p><p>&#x201C;Our golden dragon, why is it not moving?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, someone noticed that the golden dragon that had been roaring repeatedly and shuttling through the clouds to manifest its might had actually hidden itself beneath the clouds motionlessly. It was displaying an appearance of cowardice.</p><p>In fact, if one were to look closely, one would see that golden dragon was actually shivering. It was as if it were deeply afraid.</p><p>&#x201C;Aoouuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the black enormous lightning beast roared at that golden dragon.</p><p>After hearing that roar, the shivering golden dragon acted like a mouse that had encountered a cat. It immediately turned around and, with an extremely fast speed, rushed into Nangong TIanshi&#x2019;s palace and back into Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>This scene caused the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan to become speechless. What sort of situation was this? The golden dragon that they took pride in actually fled out of fear from that enormous lightning beast&#x2019;s roar!!!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
