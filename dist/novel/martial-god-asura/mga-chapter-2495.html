<p><strong> Chapter 2495 - Extremely Marvelous</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What do you mean by that?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;We both have our cultivations sealed, and can only obtain the power within our respective light pillars.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The amount that we can obtain will determine our strength. And I, I have obtained nearly all of the power from the light pillar behind me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you still insist on contending against me, I will not show leniency toward you,&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;I have yet to start. What makes you so certain that I will obtain less power from my light pillar than you?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Because you are inferior to me to begin with,&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming spoke arrogantly.</p><p>Young Master Li Ming was currently emitting an air of absolute arrogance from all over his body, including his gaze, his skin, his every pore and his every hair.</p><p>&#x201C;Truly shameless. Just because he won once through a sneak attack, did he really think that he is unparalleled in this world?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen was so furious that her face turned deep red. She wanted to rush out and teach Young Master Li Ming a proper lesson.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Compared to Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng was relatively calm. He did not argue with Young Master Li Ming. Instead, after letting out a chuckle, he extended his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand spread open, and he pressed his palm onto the Profound Light Pillar. Then, the radiance from the Profound Light Pillar began to enter Chu Feng&#x2019;s body through his palm.</p><p>The speed at which Chu Feng refined the Profound Light Pillar was extremely fast. As the vast amount of energy entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s body, the Profound Light Pillar started to rapidly shrink in size.</p><p>&#x201C;How could it be this fast?&#x201D; At that moment, the plain-clothed old monk&#x2019;s expression changed.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng is too fast. If this is to continue, he might produce the opposite of the desired result,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>However, Chu Feng continued to maintain the rapid speed at which he was refining the Profound Light Pillar. He did not show any sign of slowing down. Soon&#x2026; that Profound light Pillar went from one meter long to one foot long. Furthermore, it was still rapidly shrinking.</p><p>&#x201C;This guy&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s expression also changed somewhat. A surprised expression appeared in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Golden Crane, it seems like&#x2026; Chu Feng was not affected by his rapid speed,&#x201D; The plain-clothed old monk said to the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;No, he will definitely slow down. Being this fast will only affect his final performance. Chu Feng&#x2026; is letting his emotions affect his decisions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;His temperament is inferior to Li Ming&#x2019;s. He actually allowed himself to be incited by Li Ming&#x2019;s words of provocation,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal shook his head.</p><p>At that moment, the Profound Light Pillar had been refined to the point where it was only five centimeters long.</p><p>However, the speed at which the Profound Light Pillar was shrinking also started to rapidly decrease. Even though it was still being refined by Chu Feng, the speed at which it was being refined was simply a heaven and earth difference when compared to before.</p><p>Although the speed had decreased enormously, the Profound Light Pillar was still being refined.</p><p>Four centimeters. Three centimeters. The speed grew slower and slower. However, Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s gaze grew less and less stable.</p><p>If Chu Feng were to continue to refine the Profound Light Pillar, he would soon shrink the Profound Light Pillar to the same size he had made his, shrink his Profound Light Pillar to the point where it was only a centimeter long.</p><p>If that was the case, it would mean that Chu Feng had reached the same heights he had. At that time, the arrogant boasts he had made earlier would have been made in vain.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, the Profound Light Pillar shrunk to a size of only two centimeters. At that size, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Profound Light Pillar stopped shrinking.</p><p>&#x201C;Huu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, one could clearly see that Young Master Li Ming took a deep sigh of relief.</p><p>He was truly panicking. Earlier, he was truly afraid that Chu Feng would continue to refine the Profound Light Pillar.</p><p>However, he had now managed to relieve himself. Even though there was not much of a difference between them, Chu Feng was still a bit weaker.</p><p>&#x201C;He stopped. It would appear that the final two centimeters of the Profound Light Pillar is Chu Feng&#x2019;s limit.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems like you were correct. Chu Feng is indeed inferior to Li Ming,&#x201D; The plain-clothed old monk said.</p><p>&#x201C;No, Chu Feng was being too quick earlier. If instead he had gradually refined the Profound Light Pillar like Li Ming had, he would most likely have been able to refine the Profound Light Pillar to only one centimeter long like Li Ming did,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Pa, pa, pa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, claps could be heard. It was Young Master Li Ming.</p><p>As he clapped, Young Master Li Ming looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. At that moment, there was no longer any contempt toward Chu Feng in his eyes. However, he was still as arrogant and proud as before.</p><p>&#x201C;Not bad. To be able to accomplish this much, it would appear that you possess the qualifications to contend against me,&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Those words you&#x2019;ve just said, seems like you feel that I&#x2019;ve already finished?&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Young Master Li Ming with a smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you perhaps planning to tell me you&#x2019;re not finished?&#x201D; Young Master Li Ming smiled mockingly. He simply did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to continue to refine the Profound Light Pillar.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that, moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm trembled. The power contained in the Profound Light Pillar started to rapidly fly toward Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm. The speed was so astonishingly fast. In merely a blink of an eye, the Profound Light Pillar shrunk to only one centimeter long.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, he actually managed to accomplish that?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, not to mention the plain-clothed old monk, even the Golden Crane True Immortal was astonished.</p><p>The Golden Crane True Immortal had judged that Chu Feng had refined the Profound Light Pillar too quickly. Thus, it would affect his result.</p><p>That was why when Chu Feng had refined the Profound Light Pillar to two centimeters in length, he felt that Chu Feng&#x2019;s potential should be equally matched with Young Master Li Ming&#x2019;s. Even if it was inferior, it wouldn&#x2019;t be that much inferior. He felt that Chu Feng had merely been overeager and impatient, but his actual potential would be on par with Li Ming&#x2019;s.</p><p>Yet, Chu Feng continued to refine the Profound Light Pillar, shrinking it in size. From the size of two centimeters, he shrunk it to one centimeter long.</p><p>This meant that Chu Feng&#x2019;s potential was stronger than Li Ming&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Young Master Li Ming also revealed an astonished expression. This was the first time Chu Feng saw Young Master Li Ming revealing this sort of expression.</p><p>Evidently, Li Ming also knew what Chu Feng had accomplished signified.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm trembled again. The Profound Light Pillar started to be refined by him again.</p><p>The remaining one centimeter of Profound Light Pillar was completely broken down by an enormous suction power. Soon, the Profound light Pillar completely scattered apart. It turned into a strand of light, and was sucked into Chu Feng&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Young Master Li Ming was stupefied. He simply did not dare to believe his eyes. The reason for that was because the Profound Light Pillar had disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;He actually completely refined the Profound Light Pillar. There is actually really someone capable of doing that?&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s face was filled with disbelief and excitement. Even his body was trembling nonstop.</p><p>It was the trembling of excitement. His reactions were like those of someone searching for treasures finding an incomparably precious treasure.</p><p>At that moment, the plain-clothed old monk did not say anything. However, a complicated gaze was flickering in his aged and deep gaze.</p><p>His gaze was fixed onto Chu Feng. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>&#x201C;The result is determined. Chu Feng directly refined the Profound Light Pillar till it disappeared. As a result, Li Ming has lost the chance to capture his Profound Light Pillar. It is Chu Feng&#x2019;s victory,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal exclaimed.</p><p>&#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t you a bit disappointed?&#x201D; The plain-clothed old monk asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Why do you say that?&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I know that you were deeply looking forward to this confrontation between Chu Feng and Li Ming. However, before the match even began, it ended. Are you not disappointed with that?&#x201D; The plain-clothed old monk asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal chuckled, &#x201C;Today, I have witnessed someone capable of completely refining the Profound Light Pillar. A scene like this is much more marvelous than a match. Thus, how could I be disappointed?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. What we have seen today is indeed extremely marvelous,&#x201D; The plain-clothed old monk nodded in agreement.</p><p>At that moment, those two grand characters started to talk cheerfully and wittily. However, the concentrated astonishment in their eyes did not decrease in the slightest.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
