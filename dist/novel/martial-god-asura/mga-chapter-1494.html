<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1494 - Eight Armed Deity Formation</strong></p><p>The attack of the giant golden Buddha was like the display of the might of a god. While the elders present were able to withstand the pressure from the giant Buddha&#x2019;s divine might, the disciples were unable to. At this moment, many disciples had actually knelt onto the ground in succession and began to worship Chu Feng.</p><p>They were not doing this out of fear. Instead, it was because the giant golden Buddha was emitting a very sacred power that caused people to have an urge to kneel and worship it.</p><p>The ordinary disciples did not possess enough strength or resistance and thus, they were unable to withstand this sort of power from the giant golden Buddha, and involuntarily knelt onto the ground to worship the giant Buddha.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard that the truly powerful slaughtering world spirit techniques are not inferior to the martial cultivators&#x2019; Taboo Martial Skills.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, those sorts of world spirit techniques were only hearsay that I have never seen before. Today, to my immense surprise, I have actually seen one such spirit technique. Exactly what is this spirit formation? How did it manage to possess power that surpasses ordinary Earthen Taboo Martial Skills?!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, all of the elders and headmasters had turned their gazes to the World Spiritist Alliance. They did not know what spirit formation Chu Feng had used. Thus, they could only turn to ask the people of the World Spiritist Alliance. After all, the World Spiritist Alliance was the peak power for world spirit techniques in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; At this moment, not to mention the elders, even the grand World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master was unable to name Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation. Feeling helpless, they could only turn their gazes to Miao Renlong.</p><p>Miao Renlong had originally been the prime candidate for the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master. However, due to the fact that he was not fond of power, he had renounced this grand position.</p><p>As for the reason why Miao Renlong was thought of so highly by so many of the old monsters in the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly, it was because not only did he possess robust strength, he was also very fond of studying the ancient texts. It could be said that he was truly an experienced and knowledgeable person.</p><p>Miao Renlong understood the intention of the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master. The World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master did not wish to lose face before all the other headmasters, thus, he had turned to request Miao Renlong&#x2019;s help.</p><p>Miao Renlong secretly sent a voice transmission to the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master. &#x201C;I have heard of a legend before. In the Ancient Era, there was a royal-cloak world spiritist who fought against a Martial Emperor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That Martial Emperor was extremely powerful, and had grasped a martial skill that could turn him into a thousand-meter-tall adamantine-bodied giant. Once he used that martial skill, he would become indestructible and unstoppable. Shattering mountains and slicing apart the earth became things that were extremely trivial for him to do.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, in the end, he was defeated by that royal-cloak world spiritist. That was because that royal-cloak world spiritist had grasped a special spirit formation. That spirit formation was also a thousand meters tall. Furthermore, it was also overflowing with radiance, and possessed eight arms and hands. As for that formation, its name was the Eight Armed Deity Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;According to legend, the Eight Armed Deity Formation possesses overwhelming defensive and offensive capabilities. It was akin to a god descending upon the mortal world. For it, besieging a town or flattening the ground was as simple as walking. With a single step, it was capable of killing tens of thousands of people. In short, it was horrifyingly powerful.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although the spirit formation that little friend Chu Feng is using right now is much inferior to the legendary Eight Armed Deity Formation, its appearance greatly resembles that of the legendary Eight Armed Deity Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing Miao Renlong&#x2019;s voice transmission, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master immediately explained what Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation was to the various other headmasters.</p><p>&#x201C;Based on what you said, the spirit formation that little friend Chu Feng has used indeed resembles that legendary Eight Armed Deity Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, doesn&#x2019;t it mean that little friend Chu Feng obtained a technique from that Ancient Era&#x2019;s world spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing the explanation provided by the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master, the various headmasters were even more shocked. The gazes that they looked to Chu Feng with became even more marvelous.</p><p>They all felt that Chu Feng was a person with a great destiny. As long as he continued to mature, it might not be impossible for him to really become the overlord of an era.</p><p>In fact, not to mention the other headmasters, even the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master was shocked. After all, this matter was something that he had heard of from Miao Renlong.</p><p>He felt that if the spirit formation that Chu Feng used was not the legendary Eight Armed Deity Formation, then it would be fine. However, if it was, then Chu Feng would be too amazing.</p><p>A world spirit technique like that should have been lost a very long time ago. However, if Chu Feng were to have grasped it, it would mean that Chu Feng had stumbled upon a heavenly chance, a fated opportunity. Furthermore, upon thinking about all the many different miraculous spirit formations that Chu Feng had used before, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master felt even more intensely that Chu Feng had obtained a gargantuan fated encounter.</p><p>If this was the case, it would only be a matter of time before Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques would surpass their own. [1. I think &#x2018;they&#x2019; in this context referred to the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong. And the other headmasters. ]</p><p>In other words, if Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques were on the same level as theirs, they would likely not be a match for Chu Feng.</p><p>In fact, the world spirit technique that Chu Feng had used was indeed the legendary Eight Armed Deity Formation. This spirit formation was extremely powerful and possessed boundless power in both offensive and defensive aspects. It could be said to be the strongest slaughtering formation that Chu Feng had obtained from the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.</p><p>However, powerful things would generally have the same sort of trait. The more powerful something was, the more difficult it would be. When using a powerful technique, it would definitely consume a lot of stamina and energy from the user. As for this Eight Armed Deity Formation, the stamina and energy it consumed could be said to be frightening.</p><p>If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that Qin Wentian had trained in a demonic technique, Chu Feng would never have used this Eight Armed Deity Formation to fight against him. After all, using a spirit formation of this level would inevitably cause side-effects and backlash afterward. Furthermore, it would also consume a lot of stamina and energy from Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, did you think that you would be able to win against me with just this? If you did, then you have underestimated me, Qin Wentian, too much!&#x201D;</p><p>Qin Wentian&#x2019;s eyes started to turn crimson in color. In fact, they were even emitting a crimson aura. Following that, layer upon layer of boundless energy began permeating the surrounding air.</p><p>&#x201C;Creak, creak~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Qin Wentian&#x2019;s strength increased once again. He was on the verge of breaking free from Chu Feng&#x2019;s Eight Armed Deity Formation&#x2019;s gigantic hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Pow~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Sensing that the situation was turning amiss, with a thought from Chu Feng, the remaining seven arms of the Eight Armed Deity Formation waved forward, and the seven gigantic hands piled onto the hand that was grabbing Qin Wentian in successive layers.</p><p>In this sort of situation, Qin Wentian was suppressed once again. In fact, it could be said that he was facing absolute suppression.</p><p>If he was able to barely move when being grabbed by a single gigantic hand, then he would be completely unable to move when being grabbed by eight gigantic hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Heeeaaahhhh~~~&#x201D; Enraged, Qin Wentian snarled once again.</p><p>Following his shout of anger, the crimson gaseous substance began to surge outward like countless malicious spirits.</p><p>Merely, at this time, Qin Wentian&#x2019;s attack was not aimed toward Chu Feng. Instead, it was aimed at the disciples who were in the plaza. Qin Wentian was planning to attack his fellow disciples that were watching the battle.</p><p>&#x201C;Animal, you actually want to kill your fellow disciples to acquire more power. You are truly insolent beyond belief!&#x201D; The Ten Thousand Flowers Garden&#x2019;s headmaster instantly saw through Qin Wentian&#x2019;s intention. Unable to contain herself, she cursed out at him.</p><p>At the same time she cursed at Qin Wentian, she lightly waved her sleeve. With that wave of her sleeve, countless different multi-colored lights shot forward. Like a rainbow, they covered the entire plaza.</p><p>The beautiful multi-colored lights were not simply a multi-colored lights. They were part of a very powerful technique. When a peak Half Martial Emperor used this powerful technique, it was obvious how strong it would be.</p><p>At the very instant Qin Wentian&#x2019;s attack came into contact with the multi-colored lights, it crumbled completely.</p><p>To try to do such a malicious thing before the eight headmasters, Qin Wentian was simply indulging in fantasy.</p><p>&#x201C;Qin Wentian, you have committed countless sins and shall be put to death. Today, I, Chu Feng, shall punish evil on behalf of the heavens and send you to death.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng also felt that he could not let Qin Wentian continue living. This Qin Wentian was too dangerous.</p><p>Thus, killing intent filled Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. Following that, the Eight Armed Deity Formation&#x2019;s eight gigantic hands started to shine brightly. They began to clench tighter and tighter. They were trying to crush Qin Wentian to pieces.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
