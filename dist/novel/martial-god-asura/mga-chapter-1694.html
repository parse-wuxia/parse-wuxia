<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1694 - Taboo Gu</strong></p><p>&#x201C;So even you can be nervous,&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to Du Wanwu. He was able to hear that Du Wanwu&#x2019;s heart rate had accelerated, and his breathing had become heavy.</p><p>&#x201C;Truth be told, I am truly frightened by my Ancestor&#x2019;s methods,&#x201D; Du Wanwu smiled wryly. Then, he said, &#x201C;There are many different ways to create a Gu. As for this place, it is one of the most frightening kind. I will not conceal this from you. This place is very dangerous. You don&#x2019;t have to go in with me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I knew that this place was dangerous before I got here. Since I agreed to help you, I have already prepared to take risks. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he stepped onto the mountain of corpses and the sea of blood to continue onward. Compared to Du Wanwu, Chu Feng was a lot more calm and collected.</p><p>The reason for that was because they had the map with them. The map had clearly recorded the method to break apart all of the formations. Furthermore, Chu Feng&#x2019;s perception was very sharp. Thus, all of the traps left behind by the Poison Demon were unable to stop Chu Feng and Du Wanwu from proceeding onward, and the traps were easily broken through by them.</p><p>After continuing their journey, the two of them finally arrived at the deepest region. What appeared before them was an ancient jug. That jug was only the size of a wine jug.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was able to tell with only a single glance that this jug was very dangerous. The sinister power was originating from within that jug. This meant that the Gu that they had come to retrieve was located within the jug.</p><p>However, upon closely inspecting the jug, Chu Feng started to frown. Traces of unease appeared in his gaze.</p><p>&#x201C;Du Wanwu, I&#x2019;d like to ask you this. The Gu before us, exactly what did your ancestor use to make it?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng knew that Gus were generally made with poisonous insects. For powerful Gus, they would be made with Evil Spirits. Essentially, there were a lot of methods to make Gus, and Gus possessed a lot of different functions. However, it was extremely difficult to make Gus.</p><p>Making a Gu was a crooked method to begin with. Furthermore, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.</p><p>Since ancient times, there had been a lot of people who ended up being devoured and dying by Gus that they were trying to make. Making Gus could be said to be a taboo for world spiritists.</p><p>As for the Gu before them, it was emitting an extremely powerful and dangerous aura. Furthermore, it had already matured. This meant that it was extremely powerful.</p><p>This made it apparent that this Gu was not made with poisonous insects or Evil Spirits. It was very likely that this Gu was made from living people.</p><p>To make a Gu with living people was a taboo technique. It was the method that was the hardest to control, the method that was the most dangerous.</p><p>The Poison Demon had used fifteen thousand years to create this Gu. If he had really used living people to make it, then he would definitely have not used ordinary living people. They were most definitely peak experts.</p><p>Chu Feng also knew that Du Wanwu had come to retrieve this Gu with the intention of using it to increase his cultivation. Thus, Chu Feng was truly curious as to exactly what sort of Gu it was.</p><p>&#x201C;I am also uncertain as to what this Gu was made from. However, I know that this is an Inherited Gu,&#x201D; Du Wanwu said.</p><p>&#x201C;Inherited Gu?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes shone. He then asked, &#x201C;What is it that he wanted to pass on?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Truth be told, I also don&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; Du Wanwu smiled. Then his body moved, and he arrived before that Inherited Gu. He took out a special burlap sack, and prepared to load that jug that contained the Inherited Gu into the sack.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop,&#x201D; Seeing this scene, Chu Feng immediately spoke to stop Du Wanwu.</p><p>However, Du Wanwu was truly urgent to retrieve the Gu. By the time &#x2018;stop&#x2019; left Chu Feng&#x2019;s mouth, Du Wanwu had already retrieved the Gu.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; Seeing that the Gu had been removed from the ground, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed, and he sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right after that Gu was retrieved, a loud explosion was suddenly heard. At the same time, the surrounding ground started to crumble, with dust and rocks flying everywhere.</p><p>After a series of collapses, a total of eighty-one huge monsters flew out of the ground and surrounded Du Wanwu.</p><p>None of these eighty-one huge monsters were ordinary. They were all Evil Spirits, a total of eighty-one Evil Spirits. Furthermore, they were not ordinary Evil Spirits. Instead, they were all peak Half Martial Emperor-level Evil Spirits.</p><p>These eighty-one Evil Spirits had already lost all intelligence. Like vicious beasts, after they appeared from underneath the ground, they began to brandish their sharp claws and teeth to attack Du Wanwu with the most primitive method.</p><p>Du Wanwu was stunned the moment the eighty-one Evil Spirits appeared. Even though he was a Divine Body, the descendant of the Poison Demon, and possessed heaven-defying battle power, he was still only a rank four Half Martial Emperor. As such, how could he possibly be a match for these eighty-one Evil Spirits?</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment of imminent peril, Chu Feng turned into a ray of light, passed through the Evil Spirits and arrived beside Du Wanwu.</p><p>After reaching Du Wanwu, Chu Feng shouted, &#x201C;Evil Suppression Talismans!!!&#x201D; Then, numerous golden talismans shot out explosively from Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. They turned into a barrier that surrounded Chu Feng and Du Wanwu.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Chu Feng began to control the golden talismans, turning them into numerous chains that shot toward the eighty-one Evil Spirits, locking their limbs.</p><p>&#x201C;Aoouuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Upon coming into contact with the golden talismans, those Evil Spirits immediately started to scream repeatedly. The portion of their bodies that came in contact with those golden talismans also began to emit thick smoke.</p><p>What Chu Feng had used were the Evil Suppression Talismans that could restrain Evil Spirits.</p><p>While the Evil Suppression Talismans were capable of restraining Evil Spirits, the Evil Spirits before them were not ordinary Evil Spirits. Chu Feng was only capable of contending against them, and was not capable of subduing them. In fact, even when contending against them, he would be in a disadvantageous position.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; Chu Feng knew that if they continued to linger here, they would definitely be met with a with a calamity. Thus, without the slightest bit of hesitation, he took out a talisman paper and placed it on his boots.</p><p>Once the talisman paper came in contact with his boots, it immediately disappeared and was assimilated into the boots. Chu Feng&#x2019;s boots started to shine with dazzling light.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body moved and disappeared. He was so fast that one would simply be speechless. Likely, even peak Half Martial Emperors would not be able to compare to his speed.</p><p>What Chu Feng had used was one of the ten talisman papers that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had given him. Once the talisman paper assimilated into the boots, it would increase the speed that they gave Chu Feng. Once he used it, no one underneath the Martial Emperor realm would be able to catch up to him. That was an escape mechanism that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had bestowed to Chu Feng.</p><p>However, regardless of how fast Chu Feng might be, it would still not be that easy for him to escape. The reason for that was because those eighty-one Evil Spirits had already tightly surrounded Chu Feng and Du Wanwu from all directions.</p><p>Chu Feng was only able to increase the strength of the Evil Suppression Talismans to bring even more pain to the Evil Spirits so that he could search for a gap between them to escape.</p><p>&#x201C;Shualalala~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, those Evil Spirits actually disregarded the pain brought forth by the Evil Suppression Talismans and all began to pounce at the defensive barrier that covered Chu Feng and Du Wanwu. They were so powerful that they completely covered the defensive barrier Chu Feng and Du Wanwu were in and piled on top of it; they refused to even give Chu Feng and Du Wanwu any space to escape with.</p><p>Furthermore, at this moment, wave upon wave of powerful attacks were bombarding the defensive barrier. If this were to continue, even though the defensive barrier was formed with Evil Suppression Talismans, it would not be able to stand the attacks.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, these Evil Spirits are affected by the Gu and have changed. They are no longer ordinary Evil Spirits. The suppression brought forth by the Evil Suppression Talismans has lessened greatly on them. If this is to continue, the Evil Suppression Talismans will soon lose all effectiveness.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng frowned deeply. At this moment, the generally calm Chu Feng had started to feel extremely uneasy.</p><p>He had realized that it was not that the power of the Evil Suppression Talismans was decreasing. Rather, it was that those Evil Spirits&#x2019; immunity to the Evil Suppression Talismans was increasing.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
