<p><strong> Chapter 1953 - Must Return</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Not only is it difficult to find spatial cracks, the spatial cracks themselves can also be separated into those that are good and those that are bad. The good ones, are able to take you to where you want to go to. However, if you were to enter a bad one, you will be killed,&#x201D; Lord Lianghua said.</p><p>&#x201C;There is indeed that saying,&#x201D; The Compass Immortal nodded in agreement.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, why are you insistent on going to the Eastern Sea Region?&#x201D; Baili Xuankong asked. He was already able to tell from the conversation how dangerous it was to return to the Eastern Sea Region. Thus, he deeply wanted to advise Chu Feng against braving the dangers to go there should it not be absolutely necessary for him to do so.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, I will not conceal this from you all. The Eastern Sea Region is the place where I must go to. Although I am from the Outer World, I grew up in the Eastern Sea Region. My family and friends are there. I cannot disregard them and leave them there,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>The Compass Immortal sighed. &#x201C;Chu Feng, I am not finding fault with you. Merely, a man should aspire to travel far and make his mark. As such, how could one be bound by one&#x2019;s family and friends?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, if your friends and family are to know that you decided to brave danger for their sake, I believe they would not agree to it either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What the Compass Immortal said is very reasonable,&#x201D; Baili Xuankong and the others also voiced their agreement. Actually&#x2026; they were all against it for Chu Feng&#x2019;s sake.</p><p>&#x201C;That is only one of the reasons. There is also another reason,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Another reason? You have another reason?&#x201D; Baili Xuankong asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;What sort of reason would make you be willing to brave that sort of danger?&#x201D; Lord Lianghua asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Emperor Qing, Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s remnants,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What?!!!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the expressions of the crowd present all changed enormously. In fact, they even stood up from their seats very emotionally.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what did you just say? You said Emperor Qing, Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s remnants?&#x201D; Nangong Longjian asked. At this moment, everyone was looking at Chu Feng. They were all unable to believe their ears.</p><p>After all, Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s reputation was truly too enormous. Furthermore, the location of his remnants had been a mystery in the Holy Land of Martialism the entire time.</p><p>Countless people had tried to search for this remnants. Even Nangong Longjian, Lord Lianghua and the Compass Immortal had attempted to search for them before. Yet, no one had managed to find it.</p><p>However, at that moment, Chu Feng actually declared that he knew the location of Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s remnants? As such, how could they not be shocked?</p><p>&#x201C;Emperor Qing, Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s remnants are located in the Eastern Sea Region&#x2019;s Nine Provinces Continent. That was the place of his birth. In other words, senior Qing Xuantian and I are from the same hometown,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that there was already no need for him to conceal this fact from the crowd present anymore. After all, all of these people present were worthy of his trust.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?!!&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd became even more shocked. The exceptional geniuses of two separate eras were actually from the same hometown?</p><p>What sort of place was the Nine Provinces Continent? Could it be a place that was filled with geniuses?</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, these are&#x2026; the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird and Black Tortoise.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng spoke, he revealed all four of his Great Supreme Secret Skills. He had revealed them completely, and allowed them to take form in their most complete form.</p><p>&#x201C;Those are Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s four guardian beasts. There&#x2019;s no mistake about it. Even though they&#x2019;ve turned into secret skills, those are definitely their auras.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, so you were actually Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s successor?&#x201D; Lord Lianghua was a very old person. He had lived for over ten thousand years, and had personally met Qing Xuantian, as well as his four guardian beasts.</p><p>Thus, he recognized right away that Chu Feng&#x2019;s Four Great Supreme Secret Skills were Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s four guardian beasts.</p><p>&#x201C;I am not really senior Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s successor. Merely, I managed to obtain his Four Great Supreme Secret Skills by coincidence,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s four guardian beasts have turned into secret skills. In that case, Qing Xuantian is really dead?&#x201D; At that moment, for some ineffable reason, the crowd felt sorrow.</p><p>Even though Qing Xuantian has disappeared for many years, and the crowd all felt that he had died, they all possessed a glimmer of hope, a delusion, that he was still alive.</p><p>&#x201C;I do not know whether or not senior Qing Xuantian is dead or alive. All that he left behind was a remnant, and not a grave,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, it means that Qing Xuantian might still be alive?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Nangong Longjian and the others became spirited again.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. All I know is that senior Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s four guardian beasts are not really dead.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I possess the means to revive them. Merely&#x2026; I will have to return to the Eastern Sea Region&#x2019;s Nine Provinces Continent,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;The revival of Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s four guardian beasts? Those four guardian beasts were very powerful. If they were able to be revived-!!!&#x201D; As Lord Lianghua said this, he gasped and said, &#x201C;It would seem that little friend Chu Feng must return to the Eastern Sea Region after all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Lianghua, were Lord Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s four guardian beasts really that powerful?&#x201D; Baili Xuankong asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Not to mention the four guardian beasts, any one of them possessed strength that surpassed my own,&#x201D; Lord Lianghua said.</p><p>&#x201C;Above Lord Lianghua?!!!&#x201D; Hearing that, the crowd was astonished once again.</p><p>When the four guardian beasts were already this powerful, how enormously powerful was Qing Xuantian himself?</p><p>At that moment, the crowd seemed to be able to imagine the strength that Qing Xuantian had possessed back then.</p><p>If Qing Xuantian were still alive, the Dark Hall would likely not be able to behave this atrociously in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>After being shocked, the crowd all grew silent. Since the four guardian beasts were that powerful, they were unable to find a reason to reject the second reason that Chu Feng had provided for his need to return to the Eastern Sea Region.</p><p>This was especially true in their current situation where they were faced with a great enemy in the form of the Dark Hall. If they were able to revive Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s legendary four guardian beasts, it would undoubtedly be an enormous assistance to them. In fact, they might even be able to reverse the situation of the battle!!!</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, even though returning to the Eastern Sea Region is very difficult, it is not impossible.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This old man is, after all, a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Just leave this matter to me,&#x201D; The Compass Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Compass Immortal, your intention is?&#x201D; Baili Xuankong asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I will go to the Heavenly Road&#x2019;s exit and stand guard there. If I am to discover a spatial crack, I will use my abilities to maintain it and prolong the time that it remains in effect. Then, I will inform little friend Chu Feng,&#x201D; The Compass Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;That may be the only way,&#x201D; As Lord Lianghua spoke, he took out a golden flash bird and said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, leave your imprint on it.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng understood Lord Lianghua&#x2019;s intentions. Not only did Chu Feng leave his imprint on the Golden Flash Bird, he also personally handed it to the Compass Immortal, &#x201C;Senior Compass, I&#x2019;ll have to trouble you.&#x201D;</p><p>Trouble. Indeed, it would be a very troubling task. He would have to wait at the Heavenly Road&#x2019;s exit and wait for the appearance of spatial cracks that would only appear rarely and completely at random.</p><p>Everyone knew how dull, boring and extremely unendurable that task would be.</p><p>To have someone like the Compass Immortal go and do something like that would truly be putting him at an enormous inconvenience unworthy of his status.</p><p>&#x201C;My, Chu Feng, you are regarding me as an outsider with those words. If we can eliminate the Dark Hall, I would not mind guarding the Heavenly Road&#x2019;s exit until the day I die. Hahaha,&#x201D; The Compass Immortal burst into loud laughter. His laughter was filled with indifference. His laughter was very unrestrained.</p><p>However, hearing his laughter, the crowd present all felt admiration for him.</p><p>Even though the Compass Immortal was someone who loved to laugh, he was actually someone who cared deeply about the people of the world.</p><p>There were many people in the Holy Land of Martialism known to be Immortals. However, only someone like the Compass Immortal was actually worthy of the title of &#x2018;Immortal.&#x2019;</p><p>As for the World Devastator Immortal, the Avaricious Immortal and the like, they were simply smearing the title of &#x2018;Immortal.&#x2019;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
