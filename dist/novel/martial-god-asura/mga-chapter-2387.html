<p><strong> Chapter 2387 - Mother&#x2019;s Power</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Brat, it seems that you do possess some skills. No wonder a genius like myself would be sealed in your body.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It seems your mother thought quite a lot of you. If possible, I truly want to see what sort of person your mother is to be able to capture me from the Asura Spirit World and then seal me in your world spirit space,&#x201D; After seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s current world spirit techniques, Xue Ji gasped in admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, let me out,&#x201D; After hearing what Xue Ji said, Her Lady Queen said to Chu Feng in a serious manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Eggy, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked in a surprised manner. He rarely saw Her Lady Queen so serious.</p><p>&#x201C;I have something that I need to ask this Xue Ji face-to-face,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; Although Chu Feng did not know what Her Lady Queen wanted to do, he still opened his world spirit gate.</p><p>Her Lady Queen walked out from his world spirit gate and arrived before Xue Ji.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh. Silly little girl, it seems that this is the first time we meet face-to-face, right?&#x201D; Xue Ji said to Eggy.</p><p>It must be said that the scene of these two exceptional beauties standing together was one that would fascinate all men.</p><p>Although these two beauties were of completely different styles, they were both perfect. The two of them were akin to divine goddesses of one&#x2019;s dreams.</p><p>&#x201C;Earlier, you said that you were forcibly captured. In other words&#x2026; when you were captured, you were awake, right?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen asked Xue Ji.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course I was awake. Were you not awake when you were captured?&#x201D; Xue Ji asked.</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, I was injured. I had fallen asleep while healing my injuries. When I woke up, I discovered myself sealed in his world spirit space. I do not know much about exactly how I arrived in this world,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Silly little girl, you are truly quite pitiful. You actually do not even know how you were captured, and you were already dead set on putting your life on the line for this brat,&#x201D; As Xue Ji spoke, she took a glance at Chu Feng, who was setting up the spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;As a world spirit, one must do what world spirits should do. Regardless of how I came to this world, since I was sealed in Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit space, I should naturally work for him,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. What you said is reasonable. After all, you are still a world spirit. Unlike me&#x2026; I am already an Evil Spirit. I will never again be able to return to the Asura Spirit World,&#x201D; As Xue Ji spoke, she once again took a glance at Chu Feng. Although she still had a faint smile on her face, when her gaze landed on Chu Feng&#x2019;s body, Chu Feng felt his blood run cold.</p><p>Sure enough, Xue Ji felt enormous hatred for Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;If you had just obediently obeyed Chu Feng, he would not have released you using that method,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s this? Did you deliberately come out so that you could provide justifications for Chu Feng?&#x201D; Xue Ji asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course not. However, there&#x2019;s no need for me to tell you why I came out either,&#x201D; After Her Lady Queen finished saying those words, she turned around and walked back toward Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit space.</p><p>&#x201C;No matter what, we are both from the Asura Spirit World. We should be treating one another as relatives. Yet, why must you feel so hostile toward me?&#x201D; Xue Ji asked. She had been emitting an enchanting smile with her beautiful eyes the entire time.</p><p>&#x201C;The fact that you made Chu Feng an enemy means that you are also my enemy. I do not care what you plan to do. However, it is best that you do not do anything harmful toward Chu Feng. Otherwise&#x2026; I will make you suffer the consequences,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen turned around and said to Xue Ji.</p><p>&#x201C;Little girl, it doesn&#x2019;t seem like the current you possesses the qualifications to say those words to me, no?&#x201D; Xue Ji smiled a profound smile.</p><p>At that moment, Her Lady Queen also narrowed her eyes and smiled. It was a gorgeous smile capable of enchanting all living things. Even the simultaneous blooming of a myriad of flowers would not be as beautiful as her smile.</p><p>However, the eyes of that beautifully smiling face emitted extremely ice-cold killing intent.</p><p>&#x201C;I naturally possess the qualifications. Merely, I hope&#x2026; that you will not have to see what my qualifications are. Else&#x2026; you will definitely regret it,&#x201D; After Her Lady Queen finished saying those words, she proceeded toward the world spirit gate.</p><p>&#x201C;Why is it that after I hear what you said, I want to know exactly what your qualifications are even more?&#x201D; Xue Ji said.</p><p>Her Lady Queen did not bother with Xue Ji. She had walked into the world spirit gate and returned to Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit space.</p><p>&#x201C;If I am not mistaken, you must be trying to determine the strength of Chu Feng&#x2019;s mother by verifying whether or not I was forcibly captured and placed into Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit space, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You are truly giving it a lot of thought for this boy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you didn&#x2019;t actually have to do all that. You could have just asked me directly. I would not mind telling you such things,&#x201D; Xue Ji said.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve met my mother?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked Xue Ji.</p><p>&#x201C;No, I have not. However, I have personally felt your mother&#x2019;s power. Do you wish to know?&#x201D; Xue Ji said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Xue Ji explained, &#x201C;As a world spiritist, you should know that whether or not a world spirit is willing to serve a world spiritist depends on the world spirit itself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The only thing a world spiritist can do is to use their spirit power to communicate with a world spirit. As for world spiritists, they would then have to determine the strength of the world spiritist by the strength of that spirit power.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If they feel that the spirit power is quite decent, they would then try to further communicate. Then, they can enter a contract, and thereby open the gate leading to that world spiritist&#x2019;s world spirit space.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, that gate is a gate that only world spiritists can travel to and fro through. World spiritists are forever unable to travel through that gate and enter the spirit world,&#x201D; Xue Ji said.</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, my mother did the impossible. Not only did she forcibly open that gate and pour her power into it, she also went against your and Eggy&#x2019;s desires to forcibly capture the two of you from the Asura Spirit World and seal the two of you in my world spirit space, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;To be able to forcibly open that gate, to go against the desire of the world spirits and forcibly capture them is already something unimaginable.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, what I want to tell you is that when I was captured, I had many seniors present. They possessed strength not only capable of shocking a baby like you, but strength that would shock many people in your world.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If those seniors of mine were to descend into this world, they would become the nightmare of countless martial cultivators.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng did not doubt Xue Ji in the slightest. While Xue Ji could be lying to him, he had a feeling that she was telling him the truth right now.</p><p>Furthermore, he also believed that there should be many unimaginably powerful world spirits in the Asura Spirit World.</p><p>After all, the Asura Spirit World was the most powerful of the Seven Spirit Worlds.</p><p>At that point, Xue Ji suddenly sighed. She said, &#x201C;Unfortunately, even after those seniors of mine acted together, they were still unable to protect me from your mother.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What?!&#x201D; Chu Feng was startled upon hearing those words.</p><p>&#x201C;As such, Chu Feng, what I want to tell you is that your mother is truly extremely powerful,&#x201D; Xue Ji said as she looked at Chu Feng. Her current gaze was very complicated. It was a gaze that even Chu Feng could not see through.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you for telling me all this,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to thank me. If you want to thank someone, then thank that silly little girl in your body that is still willing to serve you. It was her who caused me to want to tell you these things. I think&#x2026; that is the reason why she came out.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I must admit that that silly little girl has managed to accomplish her aim. I have told you two all that I know,&#x201D; Xue Ji spread open her arms and shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>&#x201C;Eggy, thank you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Eggy. He finally realized how considerate Eggy was.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to be courteous with me. Actually, I merely wanted to let you know how powerful your mother is. And you&#x2026; you have inherited your mother and your father&#x2019;s bloodlines. Thus, I wanted you to realize how unfathomable your potential is. As long as you are determined, I believe that you will one day surpass your parents and become one of the strongest cultivators in this world,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;I will,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be so urgent to guarantee that. If you truly want to mature, you must treasure your life even more. At the very least, you must make fewer needless sacrifices. You especially must not be implicated by your so-called spirit of loyalty and self-sacrifice,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng smiled. He had understood that the last sentence was what Eggy wanted to tell him the most.</p><p>Even though Her Lady Queen had advised him against it, Chu Feng was still unable to change his character. He would still sacrifice himself for his friends, and disregard his life doing things that he considered to be right. However, that final sentence Her Lady Queen said had brought great warmth to Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>Her Lady Queen was truly Her Lady Queen. [1. I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. I guess Bee is trying to say that eggy is extremely profound?]</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
