<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 414 - Hundred-faced Old Man</strong></p><p><span style="">Very quickly, the news regarding Chu Feng killing Song Qingfeng, Liu Xiaoyao, Bai Yunfei, and Tang Yixiu completely spread and almost everyone knew about that.</span></p><p><span style="">But after knowing, the ones who were most shocked were none other than the four powers: the Fire God School, the Free and Unrestrained Valley, the Hidden White Sect, and the Yuangang School.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, they put up wanted posters for Chu Feng, but not only did they not catch him, their number one disciples even got killed by Chu Feng. To them, it was simply a huge humiliation.</span></p><p><span style="">Besides, Song Qingfeng and the others were disciples that their four powers very carefully developed for many years. Originally, they had heavy expectations for them, as they even planned to rely on them to lift up the banner of their schools to become the new masters.</span></p><p><span style="">But now, they were killed. And they were even killed by the same person. How could the heads of the several powers accept that? How could they endure it? How could they bear it?</span></p><p><span style="">On that day, after the four huge characters, the head of the Yuangang School, the head of the Fire God School, the head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley, and the head of the Hidden White Sect, parted from the Prestigious Villa, they gathered together once again and the place that they gathered at this time was the Free and Unrestrained Valley.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Are we truly going to invite that Hundred-faced Old Man to come?&#x201D; The head of the Yuangang School asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I also feel that it is not appropriate. We are the overlords of parts of the Nine Provinces! Right now, to chase after and kill a single person, we need to degrade ourselves to ask for a killer. If this gets known, we will become laughingstocks.&#x201D; The head of the Hidden White Sect said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Right now, we have already become the laughingstocks that people discuss about. The wanted poster says Chu Feng is in the 3rd level of the Profound realm, but the strength he showed was the 7th level of the Profound realm. He also killed our four disciples that we had developed for many years. We...We truly have no more face.&#x201D; The head of the Fire God School sighed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Face is small. It&#x2019;s the lives of the four children that can&#x2019;t be wasted for nothing. Although Xiaoyao isn&#x2019;t blood-related to me, I have seen and treated him as my own son. Right now, he has died so wretchedly. How can I only watch and do nothing?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Although it will indeed not be too great if the news of asking for the Hundred-faced Old Man gets known, who will know that it is us who asked for him? As the number one assassin, will the Hundred-faced Old Man not be moved by our wanted posters rewarding a million Profound beads?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So even if we ask for him, from the perspectives of outsiders, they will only feel that the Hundred-faced Old Man is unable to resist against the temptation of the reward and came out himself.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Besides, this Hundred-faced Old Man does indeed have some methods that normal people do not have. He is a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, and he&#x2019;s even an expert in the 3rd level of the Heaven realm. The most important thing is that his methods for tracking people is peerless in the world. There are only people he doesn&#x2019;t want to find, and none that he cannot. Right now, as we wish to kill Chu Feng, we can only ask for him.&#x201D; The head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That is correct, but his request is for us to pay five hundred thousand Profound beads first, then he would catch Chu Feng alive. Isn&#x2019;t this price a bit high? If he grabs the money but doesn&#x2019;t do the deed, what should we do? Wouldn&#x2019;t we get swindled again?&#x201D; The head of the Yuangang School worriedly said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah! Originally, the sum of the reward for the wanted posters was paid together by six powers, but right now, the four of us joins hands to ask for the Hundred-faced Old Man and he wants us to pay five hundred thousand Profound beads in advance. However, we four powers need to tackle that sum. This is really not too safe.&#x201D; The head of the Hidden White Sect also felt that it wasn&#x2019;t too appropriate.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Hundred-faced Old Man is ranked as number one on the assassin leaderboard not only because no person who he wants to be killed remains living, it is also because he has an extremely good reputation. He only takes the reward. Other than the reward, he never takes any part that doesn&#x2019;t belong to him.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Besides, those who died right now are four children who we carefully developed. They have already died, yet you are still quibbling about some Profound beads? Are these four children&#x2019;s lives not worth a hundred thousand Profound beads?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If any of you feel that this matter is not appropriate, you can back out. My Free and Unrestrained is willing to handle these five hundred Profound beads alone.&#x201D; The head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley was a bit angry.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This...&#x201D; The head of the Yuangang School and the head of the Hidden White Sect both looked at each other, being a bit speechless.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My Fire God School is willing to put out money to ask for the Hundred-faced Old Man.&#x201D; The head of the Fire God School spoke.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ehh, Free and Unstrained Valley Head, five hundred thousand Profound beads isn&#x2019;t a small number. If your valley takes all that by itself, its financial power will certainly be greatly damaged and its vitality will be heavy injured. Let us four powers take it together.&#x201D; The head of the Yuangang School smiled and said after thinking for a while.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah, it&#x2019;s best for us to tackle the price together. We also want to avenge our child! Besides, we must get that Asura Ghost Axe.&#x201D; The head of the Hidden White Sect also smiled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since it is like so, this matter has been set. I&#x2019;ll contact the Hundred-faced Old Man right now.&#x201D; As the head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley spoke, he took out a special birdcage from the palace.</span></p><p><span style="">Within the birdcage, there was a strange bird that was roughly the same size as an owl. The reason why it was called strange was because that bird had six wings.</span></p><p><span style="">The price of a bird like that was extremely expensive. Only big peak powers could afford to breed them, and they were a type of tool for sending messages. Their speed was like light and almost no one could be comparable. So, they had a name. They were called Delivery Birds.</span></p><p><span style="">However, that Delivery Bird was not bred by the head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley. It was given by the Hundred-faced Old Man. To be more precise, them asking the Hundred-faced Old Man to kill Chu Feng was, in reality, the Hundred-faced Old Man recommending himself.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Everyone, I&#x2019;m sure that you&#x2019;ve all prepared the Profound beads?&#x201D; The head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley took out a Cosmos Sack, and within it, there was already a hundred and twenty-five thousand Profound beads. He prepared it beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that, the other few also took out the Profound beads that they brought and put them in the Cosmos Sack. After confirming that there were five hundred Profound beads in the Cosmos Sack, the head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley tied the Cosmos Sack on the leg of the Delivery Bird.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Free and Unrestrained Valley Head. Are you certain that it&#x2019;s the Hundred-faced Old Man&#x2019;s Delivery Bird and it isn&#x2019;t someone borrowing it to trick us?&#x201D; Seeing that, the head of the Yuangang School worriedly asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Honestly speaking, my Free and Unrestrained Valley has done many trades before with the Hundred-faced Old man so I am very familiar with his Delivery Bird. This is the Delivery Bird that only he has. I am sure without a doubt.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As the head of the Free and Unrestrained Valley spoke, he waved his big hand and the Delivery Bird rose into the sky. With a streak of light flashing away, the Delivery Bird disappeared and not a trace of aura remained.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng still remained within the borders of the Qin Province. With a blink, several more days had passed yet Zi Ling still hadn&#x2019;t come to find Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">And Chu Feng was also not in leisure in these few days. He killed countless disciples and elders from the six big powers, and within them, there was even one Heaven realm elder.</span></p><p><span style="">Although the elder was also in the 1st level of the Heaven realm, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t exhaust that much strength to kill him when compared to killing Song Qingfeng and the others. So, Chu Feng ended up with a conclusion.</span></p><p><span style="">When his strength was in the 7th level of the Profound realm, there was absolutely no problem killing a normal person in the 1st level of the Heaven realm. As for the 2nd level of the Heaven realm, as long as that person wasn&#x2019;t too powerful, he could still fight. But if it was the 3rd level of the Heaven realm, it was likely that he could only run.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
