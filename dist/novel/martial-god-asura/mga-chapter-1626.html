<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1626 - Chu Feng Serving Tea</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, boundless Snake Mark spirit power began to emit from Meng Xiaoyan&#x2019;s body like a golden tide. It enveloped the shattered teapot and tea cups, as well as the floating tea water.</p><p>Then, he clasped his palms together, and easily fused the shattered tea cups and pots. Then, as light flickered, not only did the tea cups and pots return to their normal state, even the tea water had returned to the teapot.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, as a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, I believe that you can tell that I have altered the teapot and cups.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am not exaggerating. If you are to touch the spirit formation on them, even if you do not die, you will be crippled. Don&#x2019;t think that you&#x2019;ll be able to break through the spirit formation just because you&#x2019;re a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, you can choose to not serve tea. However, you have spoken rudely towards Her Majesty Fourth Princess. Your action is equivalent to having insulted His Highness. The way I see it, if you wish to save your life, it would be better to kneel and admit your mistake,&#x201D; Meng Xiaoyan said with a beaming smile. He had spoken the truth. This was an open provocation. He was publicly humiliating Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;If you want someone to apologize, have me, Nangong Ya, apologize on Chu Feng&#x2019;s behalf,&#x201D; As Nangong Ya spoke, he was about to kowtow and apologize for Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, before Nangong Ya could kowtow, Chu Feng grabbed him and said with an earnest expression, &#x201C;Brother Nangong, if you continue to act like this, we cannot be brothers anymore.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Nangong Ya was stunned. He did not know what to do.</p><p>&#x201C;As a man, one should have courage. Such a trivial matter cannot pose a problem for me yet. I, Chu Feng, will take care of it myself,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he walked forward. Then, he said, &#x201C;The tea that I, Chu Feng, serve is not tea that just anyone can drink.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, what arrogance. The only thing I fear is that you will not be able to serve the tea even if you wanted to,&#x201D; Meng Xiaoyan sneered.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he smiled lightly. Then, he walked forward and looked at the teapot and tea cups that contained slaughtering formations over them. He smiled and said, &#x201C;The White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s personal disciple is most definitely someone who has received the personal teachings of the White-browed Immortal. I also wish to see exactly how extraordinary the White-browed Immortal&#x2019;s techniques are.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng spoke, he extended his hand and grabbed onto a teapot.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right after Chu Feng grabbed onto the teapot, a frantic power surged toward him. Then, following his hand, it entered into his body. It was planning to crush Chu Feng&#x2019;s body from the inside.</p><p>However, how could Chu Feng possibly be crushed this easily? He was already prepared and had set up a defensive formation within his body.</p><p>Instantly, Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit power surged forth and collided with Meng Xiaoyan&#x2019;s spirit power. The two streams of spirit power were like two armies as they fought within Chu Feng&#x2019;s body.</p><p>The spirit formation that Meng Xiaoyan had used caused his world spirit technique to become extremely frantic. Even Chu Feng had to admit that the spirit formation Meng Xiaoyan had used was very extraordinary.</p><p>Unfortunately, Meng Xiaoyan had yet to master that spirit formation completely. Even though that spirit formation was very powerful, Meng Xiaoyan was unable to fully utilize it. Yet, for the spirit formation that Chu Feng used, not only was it not weaker than Meng Xiaoyan&#x2019;s spirit formation, he had also grasped it completely. He was able to use it with absolute perfection.</p><p>This led to Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit power gaining the upper hand very quickly. Not only did Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit power completely crush Meng Xiaoyan&#x2019;s spirit power with an unstoppable might, his spirit power also forced Meng Xiaoyan&#x2019;s spirit power out of his body and back into the teapot, shattering the spirit formation on it.</p><p>Seeing that his spirit formation had been defeated by Chu Feng, Meng Xiaoyan started to frown. Evidently, he hadn&#x2019;t thought that Chu Feng would possess a strength this powerful. Chu Feng was many times more powerful than he had anticipated.</p><p>It must be known that the spirit formation that Chu Feng had defeated was a spirit formation that Meng Xiaoyan had set up himself.</p><p>However, what Meng Xiaoyan didn&#x2019;t know was that it was not only him, but even other Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists would not be a match for Chu Feng.</p><p>Likely, in the entire Holy Land of Martialism, there would be extremely few Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists who could surpass Chu Feng in terms of world spirit techniques.</p><p>After Chu Feng broke Meng Xiaoyan&#x2019;s spirit formation, Chu Feng picked up the teapot and filled several tea cups full of tea.</p><p>Then, with a wave of his sleeve, those tea cups landed on Nangong Tianlong, Nangong Tianhu, Nangong Tianshi and Nangong Tianfeng&#x2019;s tables.</p><p>There was even a tea cup that flew toward Meng Xiaoyan.</p><p>Merely, the teacup that flew toward Meng Xiaoyan contained a hidden attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Insignificant talent,&#x201D; Meng Xiaoyan did not cower before Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack. He extended his hand and grabbed that tea cup. Easily, he dissolved Chu Feng&#x2019;s hidden attack.</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Tianlong signaled with his eye. Then, Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi who had been blocking the path, stepped aside and returned to their respective seats.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Nangong, let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; Chu Feng pulled the kneeling Nangong Ya up and began to walk toward the exit. Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli followed closely after them.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, feel free to come again, hahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; At the moment when the four of them were leaving, wave upon wave of ridiculing laughter sounded from behind them.</p><p>As the ridiculing laughter sounded from behind them, Chu Feng and the others walked out of Nangong Tianlong&#x2019;s territory. Only after they left Nangong Tianlong&#x2019;s territory did Nangong Baihe and Nangong Ya heave a sigh of relief.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, this is all my fault. I overestimated my relationship with them. I never would have expected that they would actually end up making things difficult for you. It is still lil&#x2019; sister Baihe who possesses better eyesight,&#x201D; At this moment, the expression of shame and guilt on Nangong Ya&#x2019;s face grew even denser.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Nangong, don&#x2019;t say it like this. If what has happened today allowed you to see what sort of people they are, isn&#x2019;t that even better?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There are some words that might be improper for me to say. However, as your brother, I must still say them. That Nangong Tianlong is also not a good fellow either. It&#x2019;s best that you do not associate yourself with them. Else, I fear that they will one day harm you,&#x201D; Chu Feng advised.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand. I was muddle-headed before, and actually considered them to be my own brothers. Sigh&#x2026;&#x201D; Nangong Ya forced a smile onto his face. At this moment, he was dejected.</p><p>Nangong Ya had really considered Nangong Tianlong and the others to be his brothers before. Yet, he now discovered that he had been deceived, deceived by those he considered to be his brothers. That sort of heartache and feeling of distress was something that only he could understand.</p><p>&#x201C;But, I cannot understand why they would target you like this. There is neither hatred nor grievance between you all. It is clearly the first time that you have met them. Why did they do so?&#x201D; Nangong Ya was extremely confused.</p><p>&#x201C;Why? It&#x2019;s very simple. It&#x2019;s because I helped you all. On the Immortal Island, I was in the limelight. That limelight not only overshadowed the Beitang Imperial Clan, it has also overshadowed you all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They did what they did for the purpose of letting me know that I, Chu Feng, am still not the strongest. They want me to know that, when compared to them, I am still very small and weak.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They never planned to befriend me by inviting me over today. Their purpose was to establish their might. Establishing one&#x2019;s might does not require one to possess hatred or grievance toward another. All they&#x2019;re doing is making people that they feel to be a threat to them bow before them in fear,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;They are too excessive! As princes and princesses, how could they treat a guest this rudely?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to find Aunt Lian. I&#x2019;ll have her uphold justice for us. After my father returns, I am also going to speak to him of this matter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Ya, you must also tell your father about this so that he can uphold justice for us. We absolutely cannot let what has happened today slide,&#x201D; Nangong Baihe said angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget about it,&#x201D; However, right at this moment, Chu Feng spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
