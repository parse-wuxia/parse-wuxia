<p><strong> Chapter 1926 - To Attack First</strong></p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s slaughtering formation was a success. Even though he was unable to instantly kill the YinYang Immortal, or even injure him, he was able to hinder him.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng was completely capable of escaping. However, Chu Feng did not escape. The reason for that was because Xian Miaomiao was still here. Chu Feng could not abandon her.</p><p>Thus, not only did Chu Feng not escape, he instead unleashed his Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird and Black Tortoise, his Four Great Supreme Secret Skills.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The Azure Dragon Dashing Technique.</p><p>The White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird Revival Technique.</p><p>The Black Tortoise Armor Technique.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng did not try to conceal his Four Great Supreme Secret Skills in the slightest. Taking on the form of giant beasts, they appeared around Chu Feng. It was as if there were four Divine Beasts protecting Chu Feng.</p><p>With the increase in Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation, the strength of the Four Great Supreme Secret Skills had also increased. Furthermore, as Chu Feng had fully unleashed them, their true might was released. They emitted overwhelming dominance and exceptionally dreadful might.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>After seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s Four Great Supreme Secret Skills, the YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s eyes were filled with astonishment. He was so shocked that he became speechless.</p><p>&#x201C;Those seem to be Emperor Qing&#x2019;s four guardian beasts. Why do you have them? Could it be&#x2026; you are Emperor Qing&#x2019;s successor?&#x201D; After a long while, the YinYang Immortal asked with a voice filled with shock.</p><p>The reason for that was because this was absolutely not a small matter.</p><p>Emperor Qing was the strongest of the Five Emperors, the Five Overlords. Countless people wanted to obtain his inheritance. Yet, they were simply incapable of finding any clues leading to him. Emperor Qing was like a mystery.</p><p>And now, the four guardian beasts that accompanied Emperor Qing during his domineering days had actually appeared beside Chu Feng.</p><p>Even though the four guardian beasts surrounding Chu Feng did not possess actual bodies, and were instead in the form of secret skills, that only made things even more shocking. For this meant that Chu Feng had obtained Emperor Qing&#x2019;s inheritance.</p><p>Furthermore, this also meant that Chu Feng knew about the secrets regarding Emperor Qing. At that moment, the YinYang Immortal seemed to realized why Chu Feng was so powerful. It was all because of Emperor Qing. Chu Feng was Emperor Qing&#x2019;s successor.</p><p>&#x201C;You currently do not have&#x2026; the qualifications to ask me questions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng unleashed his attack. With the power of the Four Great Supreme Secret Skills, the perfect combination of offense, defense, speed and healing, Chu Feng took the initiative to attack the YinYang Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;A mere rank three Martial Emperor, what makes you think you can defeat me? All that you possess shall be mine.&#x201D;</p><p>The YinYang Immortal snorted disdainfully. His voice was filled with greed.</p><p>Emperor Qing&#x2019;s inheritance was something that countless people yearned for day and night. And now, that inheritance had been placed right before him. Just thinking about it caused the YinYang Immortal to feel exceptionally excited.</p><p>At the same time he spoke those words, the YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s hands began to move nonstop. He was clawing his hands at Chu Feng wildly.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In an instant, martial power began to surge. Then, several golden-bright and dazzling large hands, like eagle claws, shot toward Chu Feng. From their appearance, it seemed as if they were simply planning to tear Chu Feng to pieces.</p><p>What the YinYang Immortal used was no ordinary attack. Instead, he had used a martial skill. Even though it was only a rank nine martial skill, it was still extremely powerful. After all, the person who had unleashed that rank nine martial skill was the YinYang Immortal, a rank six Martial Emperor.</p><p>The YinYang Immortal felt that a rank nine martial skill was more than sufficient to kill a Martial Emperor of Chu Feng&#x2019;s level on the spot.</p><p>However, Chu Feng shot forth his hands explosively. Then, his White Tiger Slaughtering Technique advanced bravely. Following a roar, the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique completely shattered the YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s rank nine martial skill.</p><p>Yes, the YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s rank nine martial skill was destroyed with only a roar.</p><p>The very next moment, Chu Feng relied on the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique&#x2019;s astonishing speed to arrive before the YinYang Immortal. Then, using the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique as his main offensive method, the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique and the Black Tortoise Armor Technique as his defensive methods and the Vermillion Bird Revival Technique for support, he began to attack the YinYang Immortal nonstop.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be? You&#x2026; you&#x2026; you actually possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the YinYang Immortal was filled with astonishment. He had already realized that Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power was no longer only capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Instead, it had become capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation.</p><p>In other words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power was two entire levels higher than that of ordinary Martial Emperors.</p><p>Although Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation was only that of a rank three Martial Emperor after using his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, and although rank three Martial Emperors would absolutely be no match for rank six Martial Emperors due to the three level difference, ordinary Martial Emperors only possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p><p>Yet, Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. In other words, when compared to ordinary Martial Emperors, Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power that could provide him with the strength of two additional levels of cultivation.</p><p>Adding on those two additional levels of cultivation, Chu Feng&#x2019;s actual strength was on par with rank five Martial Emperors.</p><p>In other words, although the YinYang Immortal was a rank six Martial Emperor, the actual difference between him and Chu Feng was only a single level of cultivation.</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that you absolutely cannot be left alive,&#x201D; After experiencing that overwhelming astonishment, the YinYang Immortal revealed an even stronger killing intent.</p><p>After Chu Feng sensed his even stronger killing intent, he flipped his palm and revealed the Heavenly Immortal Sword in his hand. With the appearance of the Incomplete Imperial Armament, Chu Feng&#x2019;s battle power surged once again. That said, what was most frightening would be Chu Feng&#x2019;s superb sword technique.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand, the Heavenly Immortal Sword turned into an outstanding killing instrument. The sword rays that it shot forth not only sliced through the air, they even sliced through space itself.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng&#x2019;s speed was astonishingly fast and simply impossible to guard against. At that moment, the YinYang Immortal, a rank six Martial Emperor, was actually being suppressed by Chu Feng, a rank three Martial Emperor.</p><p>Chu Feng knew that it would be practically impossible for him to kill the YinYang Immortal. However, he had to stall for time so that Xian Miaomiao could finish refining the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Flowers. He would then escape with Xian Miaomiao.</p><p>However, in order to stall for time, he had to suppress the YinYang Immortal. Chu Feng was taking advantage of the fact that the YinYang Immortal had yet to go all-out to go all-out himself and suppress the YinYang Immortal and not allow him the chance to unleash his full power.</p><p>In other words, he was trying to gain the initiative by striking first!!!</p><p>&#x201C;Boy, your techniques are quite amazing. However, don&#x2019;t you look down on this old man,&#x201D; the YinYang Immortal shouted loudly. Then, a vast oppressive might began to sweep forth from his body. His oppressive might actually managed to beat Chu Feng back.</p><p>The YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s strength increased enormously. At that time, a water-green rod appeared in his hand. Runes and symbols were flowing through the rod, and the rod itself was glimmering with light. It was an Incomplete Imperial Armament. The YinYang Immortal had managed to beat Chu Feng back by increasing his battle power using an Incomplete Imperial Armament.</p><p>&#x201C;Allow me to see exactly how proficient you are with your Incomplete Imperial Armament.&#x201D;</p><p>As the YinYang Immortal spoke, he began to brandish the Incomplete Imperial Armament in his hand. Then, his rod began to enlarge by many times. Then, it swept toward Chu Feng.</p><p>The movement of the rod was extremely fierce. It was not only the rod itself. Even the many hurricanes caused by the YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s oppressive might began to wreak havoc through their surroundings.</p><p>At that moment, the surrounding plants were all destroyed. Earth was being blown all over the place. Everything was left in utter destruction. Only the cave behind Chu Feng remained undamaged. The reason for that was because Chu Feng gave his all to protect that cave.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s why you didn&#x2019;t escape. So there&#x2019;s actually something behind you. Allow this old man to see exactly what it is that made you protect it so painstakingly.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s whole-hearted protection of the cave behind him caught the attention of the YinYang Immortal. He had realized that Chu Feng was protecting something.</p><p>Truly a cunning old fox, after the YinYang Immortal realized that, he began to unleash even more ferocious attacks at Chu Feng. At the same time he did that, he began to devise various means to unleash attacks at the cave behind Chu Feng.</p><p>His methods were truly despicable.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
