<p><strong> Chapter 1929 - Protecting One&#x2019;s Master With One&#x2019;s Life</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Heeaahh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At the moment when the YinYang Immortal was distracted, Chu Feng threw another slash at him.</p><p>The YinYang Immortal reacted immediately. He hurriedly raised his hand to block Chu Feng&#x2019;s incoming slash. Merely&#x2026; although he had managed to block Chu Feng&#x2019;s incoming slash, he did not have the time to react to the incoming crimson lightning that hacked down from the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Ear-piercing explosions sounded and the entire region was utterly destroyed and the YinYang Immortal was struck by the crimson lightning. Not only did he lose his hold of the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade, he was also knocked to the ground several meters away.</p><p>Having obtained superiority in the fight, how could Chu Feng possibly stop with just that? He raised his legs and planned to give chase and kill the YinYang Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body trembled. Then, he grabbed onto the Evil God Sword tightly with one hand and tightly grabbed onto his own dantian with the other.</p><p>In merely an instant, cold sweat filled Chu Feng&#x2019;s entire body. Chu Feng&#x2019;s complexion turned deathly pale. He was unable to sustain the pain that was spreading throughout his body. With such enormous pain, even Chu Feng, someone who possessed a very high tolerance for pain, revealed an expression distorted by pain.</p><p>&#x201C;Persevere for a moment longer! Persevere for a moment longer! A bit more and this battle will be over!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let me kill him! Let me kill him! As long as I can kill him, even if you are to take my life, I will have no complaints!&#x201D; Chu Feng shouted with his weak voice. Those words were spoken to the Evil God Sword. Chu Feng was speaking to the Evil God Sword because he knew that the Evil God Sword was a weapon that possessed life.</p><p>Chu Feng knew that as long as the Evil God Sword was willing to help him, he would definitely be able to kill the YinYang Immortal. Furthermore, with the situation as it was, he had to kill the YinYang Immortal. Else, not only would he be killed by the YinYang Immortal, Lil Red and Xian Miaomiao would also be killed.</p><p>Compared to that, Chu Feng would rather give away his own life.</p><p>However, the Evil God Sword appeared to be unable to hear what Chu Feng was saying at all. Not only did the pain of the backlash that originated from Chu Feng&#x2019;s dantian not decrease in the slightest, it instead grew stronger and stronger. It had became so strong that Chu Feng was unable to endure the pain anymore.</p><p>Not to mention brandishing the Evil God Sword to battle again, Chu Feng was unable to even take another step forward.</p><p>&#x201C;Rooar~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, the sounds of ghosts wailing and wolves howling from the sky grew even more violent.</p><p>The pair of enormous crimson skeletal hands began to extend from the sky. They were moving toward the YinYang Immortal to grab him.</p><p>At that moment, the YinYang Immortal, who was only lightly injured, was actually unable to move at all. Suddenly, he felt an unprecedented life-threatening danger.</p><p>He was able to sense that the enormous crimson skeletal hands would smash him to death. The reason for that was because the oppressive might from those crimson skeletal hands was truly too powerful. They simply surpassed the limit of his comprehension. He knew that before the hands could even reach him, that oppressive might would have crushed him to death.</p><p>&#x201C;No, this is not real! This is not real!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly why is this happening?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>The YinYang Immortal started to shout hysterically. He truly felt as if he was dreaming.</p><p>If he had the option to choose, he would have hoped to be able to immediately wake up from this nightmare, this frightening nightmare that he no longer wished to be in.</p><p>&#x201C;Puu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng vomited out a mouthful of blood. Then his eyes closed, and he passed into unconsciousness. From the middle of the sky, he fell ruthlessly onto the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At the moment when Chu Feng lost consciousness, the enormous crimson skeletal hands in the sky began to turn into many crimson gaseous flames.</p><p>Furthermore, the violent bloody clouds and crimson bolts of lightning also turned into crimson gaseous flames. The crimson flames returned to the form of a crimson vortex that spiraled around in the sky.</p><p>At that moment, it was as if doomsday had arrived in this region. The scene was exceptionally devastating.</p><p>Finally, the spiraling crimson gaseous flames turned into a crimson ray of light and descended into the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>the sky at that moment was completely crimson before it began to gradually return to normal. The shattered void started to reform. Soon, the sky returned to its former appearance.</p><p>It had become peaceful once again.</p><p>As for the YinYang Immortal, he heaved a long sigh of relief. The reason for that was because the fatal danger had finally disappeared.</p><p>Even though the fatal danger had disappeared and the sky had returned to normal, the YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s heart remained uneasy.</p><p>The YinYang Immortal lay on the ground for quite a while before slowly standing up. He extended his hand and made a grabbing motion, and the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade returned to his hand.</p><p>Only after that did he turn his gaze to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, are you a human or a demon?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that you&#x2019;re the son of a demon? Exactly what was all that that happened earlier?&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Chu Feng had lost consciousness, the YinYang Immortal was still trembling, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>He hesitated for a very long time before slowly walking toward Chu Feng with the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade in his hand.</p><p>His speed was extremely slow and filled with cautiousness. He did not dare to be careless in the slightest.</p><p>After walking for an entire hour, he finally arrived at a location a hundred meters away from Chu Feng. He did not dare to continue to approach Chu Feng. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng with an extremely cautious gaze.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you feigning death?&#x201D; The YinYang Immortal shouted at Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng did not respond.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you think this is funny?! You are toying with me, isn&#x2019;t that right?!&#x201D; The YinYang Immortal shouted loudly. However, Chu Feng still did not respond.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, stop feigning death! Stand back up! Come and kill me!&#x201D; The YinYang Immortal was still shouting loudly. However, Chu Feng still did not respond.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; After shouting like this for a long while, the YinYang Immortal&#x2019;s incomparably nervous gaze finally started to ease up. Finally, a laugh sounded from that strange mask once again.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that you&#x2019;ve really lost consciousness. It seems that it is not you that is powerful. Instead, it&#x2019;s that Evil God Sword.&#x201D;</p><p>After verifying that Chu Feng had lost consciousness, the YinYang Immortal finally dared to continue to approach Chu Feng. After arriving before Chu Feng, his laughter became even more vile. At the same time, his laughter gave off the sense of being fortunate.</p><p>&#x201C;Evil God Sword, a legendary Demon Armament, your reputation is truly not for nothing.&#x201D;</p><p>The YinYang Immortal extended his hand toward the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand. However, right when he was about to come into contact with the Evil God Sword, he hesitated, then pulled back his extended hand.</p><p>He did not wish to touch the Evil God Sword. Even though the Evil God Sword was only a weapon, it had caused him enormous trauma, and made him feel deeply frightened of it.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, the victor is the king and the loser is the bandit. Although I should not kill you after you&#x2019;ve lost consciousness, I must kill you!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Killing intent was emitted by the YinYang Immortal once again. He began to raise his Ancient Alligator&#x2019;s Body Piercing Blade and planned to hack it down at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, a crimson light flew out from Chu Feng&#x2019;s sleeve. It was aimed at the YinYang Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that crimson light, the YinYang Immortal was deeply frightened. He hurriedly retreated several meters into the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn?&#x201D; Originally, he had thought that the Evil God Sword was acting up again. However, after looking at it carefully, his nervous state of mind began to ease up. He first took a long sigh of relief before saying with a slight smile, &#x201C;So it&#x2019;s actually you, little thing, that was causing mischief.&#x201D;</p><p>It turned out that crimson light was Lil Red. Lil Red had jumped out after seeing that Chu Feng&#x2019;s life was in danger. It was trying to protect Chu Feng.</p><p>However, even though Lil Red&#x2019;s speed was extremely fast, the person it faced was the YinYang Immortal. Thus, its surprise attack was dodged by the YinYang Immortal.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
