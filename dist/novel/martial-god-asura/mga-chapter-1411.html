<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1411 - Reverend Golden Snake?</strong></p><p>&#x201C;You wish to know? Very well, I shall let you know,&#x201D; Chen Sanyuan snorted coldly. He raised his hand and smashed down with a palm strike.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>His palm strike was extremely powerful, and contained boundless surging martial power. Anywhere the palm strike passed, the space around it would distort. It was as if the sky were about to collapse before his palm strike.</p><p>At this moment, everyone present experienced an immense pressure. Even Chu Feng was no exception.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing, is this the strength of peak Half Martial Emperors, the existence closest to Martial Emperors?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng was unable to help himself from gasping with amazement. Even though that palm strike was not aimed at him, he was still able to sense the might contained within it.</p><p>Before that palm strike, Chu Feng felt powerless. This was not only limited to Chu Feng; the majority of the people present also felt powerless to stop this sort of powerful palm strike.</p><p>In other words, merely this single palm strike was sufficient to kill the majority of the people present on the plaza. To be exact, other than the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master, Miao Renlong and several other super experts, practically no one else would be able to withstand the might of this palm strike.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh.&#x201D;</p><p>At the moment when the might of that palm strike stunned countless people present, the mysterious old man suddenly turned his head around and turned his gaze toward the palm strike that was coming at him from the sky. After that, the ferocious palm strike actually disappeared. It had completely disappeared without a trace. It was as if it had never been there to begin with.</p><p>&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</p><p>Faced with this scene this sudden scene, the crowd were all struck dumb. Even the expressions on Miao Renlong and the others&#x2019; faces changed greatly as a deep unease appeared between their brows.</p><p>One must know that the mysterious old man had not done anything. He had merely looked at Chen Sanyuan&#x2019;s palm attack and made it disappear.</p><p>&#x201C;Mere insignificant talent, yet you dare to show it off to disgrace yourself?&#x201D; Right at the moment when everyone was stunned, the mysterious old man suddenly extended his palm from his cloak&#x2019;s sleeve. He turned to the space in front of him and made a grabbing motion.</p><p>&#x201C;Snap~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A loud thunderous sound exploded. However, it was actually the sound of space bursting apart.</p><p>Numerous cracks had appeared on the boundless space, and soon spread several miles outward. It was a truly frightening sight.</p><p>At the time when space burst open, the spirit formation that Chen Sanyuan and Zhao Qinghen had set up also burst apart. Even their bodies started to sway; they had lost the ability to remain standing in the air and fell from the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors!&#x201D; Seeing that the situation was bad, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong both soared into the sky. They arrived beside Chen Sanyuan and Zhao Qinghen and supported their falling bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuwaa~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, at the moment the two of them approached Chen Sanyuan and Zhao Qinghen, they actually also lost their ability to stand in the air. Together with Chen Sanyuan and Zhao Qinghen, the two of them started to fall from the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Alliance Master!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, many of the people from the World Spiritist Alliance started to panic. They all flew into the sky to try to rescue the four men.</p><p>After all, those four men were very influential individuals in their World Spiritist Alliance. If the four of them were to fall to the ground, it would not only be their own humiliation, it would also be a humiliation to the entire World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>Thus, although it might bring danger to their lives, and although their power was extremely weak, the elders of the World Spiritist Alliance still had to go and try to rescue the four of them.</p><p>Countless figures appeared on the horizon. There were those that were using martial skills and those that were using world spirit techniques. In fact, there were even those that joined hands to set up spirit formations.</p><p>They truly exerted all of their strength and used all of their respective methods. Even at the risk of their lives, they had to stop that strange force that had left their four leaders powerless.</p><p>However, without any exception, regardless of what sort of cultivation they might have, regardless of whether they were royal-cloak world spiritists or not, as long as they approached the four men, they all became powerless. Like ordinary mortals, they became unable to even fly. The only thing they could do was howl in grief as they fell from the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ouch!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My back!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, all of the people who had soared into the sky, other than Chen Sanyuan, Zhao Qinghen, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong, fell ruthlessly to the ground.</p><p>Although, with their cultivations, they should be fine even if they were to fall from the sky, this time was an exception. All of the people who had fallen to the ground started to grimace in deep pain.</p><p>As for Chen Sanyuan, Zhao Qinghen, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong, they stopped falling and started floating at a distance two meters from the ground. They had not truly fallen to the ground.</p><p>It was only when everyone else had fallen to the ground that the four of them descended to the ground too. Merely, at this moment, they had regained their power and descended steadily onto the ground.</p><p>At this moment, the four grand characters who had tried to use force to restrain the mysterious old man all had heavy expressions on their faces.</p><p>That was because the four of them all knew that the mysterious old man had been lenient toward them. Else, they would have fallen ruthlessly to the ground before everyone, like the elders who had come to save them.</p><p>When even the four of them were acting this way, there was no need to mention what sort of expression the elders and disciples present had on their faces right now.</p><p>They were simply shocked stupid. The people who they believed to be the strongest, their Alliance Master, Elder Miao Renlong and even the two elders from the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly were unable to fight back at all. In fact, they even lost all power, and became similar to ordinary people. This was truly too frightening. So frightening that it was hard for them to confront this reality.</p><p>&#x201C;Martial Emperor. Although he has hidden himself extremely well, this sort of power is definitely that of a Martial Emperor. What he used earlier was true Emperor-level martial power, and his cultivation is that of an actual Martial Emperor,&#x201D; Chu Feng muttered.</p><p>A heavy expression was on Chu Feng&#x2019;s face. Although this was not the first time he had experienced the power of a Martial Emperor, it was still very shocking.</p><p>The might of the mysterious old man was powerful, truly powerful. So powerful that it seemed as if it could rule over everything. Once the mysterious old man unleashed his might, he made everyone feel extremely tiny, and that their lives were not their own.</p><p>Although there was only a single realm of difference between Half Martial Emperor and Martial Emperor, the gap was enormous and insurmountable. As long as they did not step over the gap, they would never be able to confront a Martial Emperor. Even if they possessed heaven-defying battle power, they would still be unable to match up to a Martial Emperor.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be, you are Reverend Golden Snake?&#x201D; Finally, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master spoke. His tone was filled with respect and even contained fear.</p><p>As for the question that he asked, it was also the question that everyone present wanted to know. After all, this mysterious old man was so powerful that he was actually a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Furthermore, that mysterious woman had grasped the Golden Snake Soul Sucking Formation. Thus, the crowd inevitably felt that it was very likely that this mysterious old man was the vicious world spiritist who had shaken the entire Holy Land of Martialism eight thousand years ago, the infamous Reverend Golden Snake.</p><p>Everyone from the World Spiritist Alliance grew nervous. Even the Alliance Master and Miao Renlong were very nervous.</p><p>They were afraid. They were deeply afraid that this mysterious old man was the Reverend Golden Snake.</p><p>After all, there was conflict between the Reverend Golden Snake and their World Spiritist Alliance. Furthermore, that Reverend Golden Snake was a very frightening existence who had, eight thousand years ago, defeated all of the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s experts and nearly defeated even all of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly&#x2019;s experts.</p><p>If this mysterious old man was truly the Reverend Golden Snake, then what awaited the World Spiritist Alliance would likely be a calamity, a true calamity.</p><p>&#x201C;Reverend Gold Snake?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Humph~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Do not compare this old man with that scum.&#x201D;</p><p>However, to everyone&#x2019;s surprise, that mysterious old man actually declared it to be false.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
