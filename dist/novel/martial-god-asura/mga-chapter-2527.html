<p><strong> Chapter 2527 - Zhao Hong&#x2019;s Decision</strong></p><p>The four sinister and frightening ferocious beasts were red, green, blue and purple.</p><p>Although their bodies were only bodies of light and not actual physical bodies, the oppressive sensation they emitted was enough to make one suffocate.</p><p>At that moment, the four beasts all possessed a ray of light that was linked to Wang Qiang&#x2019;s body like chains.</p><p>The four different colored rays of lights all gathered on Wang Qiang&#x2019;s body. That was how the four different lights and gaseous flames came to be.</p><p>&#x201C;This shouldn&#x2019;t be an Inherited Bloodline, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng was pleasantly surprised. He was surprised at how powerful those beasts were, and gratified that Wang Qiang was the master of such power.</p><p>That said, although the four ferocious beasts were emitting very dark and gloomy auras, they made him recall his own Four Great Secret Skills, the Four Symbols Divine Body.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that Wang Qiang&#x2019;s power was very possibly that of a Divine Body. Furthermore, it should be a very powerful sort of Divine Power.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, it doesn&#x2019;t resemble an ordinary Inherited Bloodline. However, it also doesn&#x2019;t resemble Divine Power. I have never seen such a strange Divine Power,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Regardless of what it is, it seems that the power within my husband&#x2019;s body is very strong, no?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Wang Qiang was fine, Zhao Hong revealed an extremely overjoyed expression. Furthermore, her eyes seemed to be shining as she swept her gaze across the four ferocious beasts nonstop.</p><p>&#x201C;Wang Qiang&#x2019;s power has only just awakened. It is still unstable. We will know whether this is a special sort of Inherited Bloodline or a special sort of Divine Power when his power completely awakens,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, how long do you think it&#x2019;ll take for Wang Qiang&#x2019;s power to completely awaken?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s very hard to say. That said, I have seen many people with hidden powers awakening.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;According to the experience I have, after a person&#x2019;s power is completely awakened, that person will also receive an increase in strength.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The longer it takes for a power to completely awaken, the more powerful it will be. Thus, it is not detrimental for Wang Qiang to take a long time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Before he awakens completely, you all can have him stay here with me,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said to Chu feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng and Zhao Hong hurriedly expressed their thanks.</p><p>The two of them knew very well that the Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s residence could be said to be one of the safest places in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Unless it was an expert from an Upper Realm, practically no one in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would dare come to Mount Cloud Crane to act atrociously.</p><p>If Wang Qiang could continue to stay here, the power within him would definitely be able to awaken safely.</p><p>&#x201C;It would appear that my brother has not suffered in vain. At the very least, it allowed the power within him to awaken. This could also be considered to be fortune from within a disaster,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, that&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; Zhao Hong nodded repeatedly. She was smiling very brilliantly.</p><p>Afterwards, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong chatted with the Golden Crane True Immortal about many things.</p><p>From their conversations, the Golden Crane True Immortal came to find out about Chu Feng and Zhao Hong killing Dugu Jianxu and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, Zhao Hong, I must say that the two of you are simply too impulsive.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, since it has already happened, I will not say too much about it. Merely, this time around, the two of you have offended all four of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&#x2019;s tier one powers. When you two go out again, you must be extra careful.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Else, you might end up losing your lives here, and miss the opportunity to journey to the Upper Realms,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, please rest assured. This was caused by me, Zhao Hong. I am able to shoulder this responsibility.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will definitely not continue to hide in Mount Cloud Crane. I will leave right now.&#x201D;</p><p>After Zhao Hong finished saying those words, she clasped her fist at the Golden Crane True Immortal and added, &#x201C;Senior, thank you for your hospitality, and thank you for protecting my husband. I, Zhao Hong, will remember senior&#x2019;s kindness. I will definitely repay you in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>After she finished saying those words, Zhao Hong immediately got up and proceeded to walk toward the exit of Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>Seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly chased after Zhao Hong. He was only able to stop Zhao Hong outside of Mount Cloud Crane, &#x201C;Zhao Hong, Senior Golden Crane did not have the intention to drive us out. Why must you be this emotional?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I know that Senior Golden Crane does not have the intention to drive us out. I am also not doing this because of anger toward Senior.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, right now, I really do have an important matter that I must take care of,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, even if you must leave, we should leave together. I&#x2019;ll accompany you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;No,&#x201D; Zhao Hong shook her head, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you must stay here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With the current situation, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is simply too dangerous. However, with your talent, as long as you enter closed-door training, you will definitely one day break through into True Immortal realm. At that time, with all the abilities you possess, you will not have to be afraid of the four tier one powers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Golden Crane True Immortal possesses quite a good relationship with you. Although he will not help us take care of our enemies, he should be willing to agree to have you stay here and undergo closed-door training.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, at this time, it&#x2019;s best for you to stay on Mount Cloud Crane,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;No, if I, Chu Feng, am to hide myself like this, I&#x2019;ll truly become an object of ridicule for the four tier one powers, an object of ridicule for the people of the world,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that you plan to continue fighting against them? But, Chu Feng, our enemy was only the Kong Heavenly Clan before. And now, it is all of the four tier one powers. They are the strongest powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. How are you to take them on?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, I am leaving because I have something important that I must do. I will not be able to bring you with me, and also will not be able to fight against the four tier one powers with you,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly what is so important for you to leave this urgently? Explain to me exactly what it is. Else&#x2026; I will not let you go,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>At that moment, Zhao Hong grew silent. Chu Feng was able to see hesitations and misgivings in her eyes.</p><p>However, after a short moment, Zhao Hong opened her mouth, &#x201C;Actually, I should tell you about this matter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely&#x2026; I fear that you will worry. That&#x2019;s why I have been hesitant to tell you the entire time. Since you insist on learning about it, I will not keep it from you.&#x201D;</p><p>It turned out there was a reason why Zhao Hong&#x2019;s cultivation had been able to increase during the past two years. She had managed to encounter another chance opportunity, and discovered another remnant.</p><p>She had not been to the depths of that remnant the entire time. The reason for that was because there was a certain amount of danger in the remnant.</p><p>However, as she had made enemies of the four tier one powers, if she did not increase her cultivation rapidly, she would only become a burden.</p><p>Zhao Hong did not wish to become Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&#x2019;s burden.</p><p>Thus, she had decided to challenge that remnant.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you really not need me to accompany you?&#x201D; Chu Feng was worried. From Zhao Hong&#x2019;s tone, he was able to tell that even though that remnant was capable of allowing her to become stronger, it was also capable of killing her.</p><p>&#x201C;I know that you can help me. However, I wish to accomplish this task myself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you know it too. For Martial Cultivators, we must mature through predicaments. For some things, I must face them myself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, didn&#x2019;t you yourself also experience a lot in order to grow so much in such a short period of time?&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. Since you&#x2019;ve decided, I will no longer stop you. However&#x2026; you must definitely return safely. Your husband is still waiting for you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;I will definitely succeed. Are you really planning to take on the four tier one powers with your current strength and by yourself?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I truly hope you can stay here to accompany my husband. With your talent, when my husband&#x2019;s power is completely awakened, you will definitely be able to make progress too. If you are to give me enough time, I too will definitely succeed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, the three of us can come out together and declare war against the four tier one powers. Wouldn&#x2019;t that be even better?&#x201D; Zhao Hong asked.</p><p>She was not only very emotional when she said these words, but her eyes were also filled with anticipation.</p><p>It seemed that Zhao Hong had already made preparations to take on the four tier one powers in the future.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
