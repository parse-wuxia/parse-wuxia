<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 896 - No Good Compensation for Being a Good Person</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Outsider?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You said who&#x2019;s an outsider?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re saying I, Chu Feng, am an outsider?&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed immediately. It twisted quite a bit, and there was even a bit of fury in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">In order to save the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, he had hurried over here from the faraway Misty Peak. When they were in a desperate situation, he ignored the risks to his life and went to save them. He even dragged Qiushui Fuyan, who was completely unrelated to his matter, into this trouble. That brought her serious wounds on her body, and she nearly lost her life.</span></p><p><span style="">But now, one of the Protectors, who held the highest position in the Crippling Night Demon Sect and had the most power, said he was an outsider. How could Chu Feng </span><i><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> be furious?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master, what are you saying? How is Chu Feng an outsider? He is a brother of our Crippling Night Demon Sect! Besides, he only came here today to save us! If he hadn&#x2019;t appeared on time, perhaps we would have already died! How can you say this to him?!&#x201D; You Tonghan also stood out at that moment, attempting to give You Mingdeng an explanation.</span></p><p><span style="">*bam* But before You Tonghan even finished speaking, You Mingdeng waved his hand and landed a resounding slap on You Tonghan&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">That slap sent You Tonghan several meters away in the air. He even crashed into several trees one meter thick. From that, it could be seen how much strength You Mingdeng put into that slap.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You unfilial thing, are you doubting your master&#x2019;s words?&#x201D; You Mingdeng howled extremely furiously after slapping You Tonghan.</span></p><p><span style="">As for You Tonghan, he hurriedly stood up and rubbed his red and swelling face. He hesitated some more, but didn&#x2019;t say anything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lord Protector&#x2026;&#x201D; But in spite of that scene, the Water King still stood out, and wanted to defend Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of you, shut up!&#x201D; However, You Mingdeng did not give them any chances to speak. After he shouted explosively, he released his aura of a rank four Martial King.</span></p><p><span style="">That might was really too powerful. Even though You Mingdeng had already held himself back, all of them still felt they were suffocating and their bones would shatter at any moment.</span></p><p><span style="">As they were subjected to such pressure, who dared to speak any more? Everyone remained silent&#x2014;even the Water King and Fire King.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, You Mingdeng once again cast his gaze towards Chu Feng and icily said, &#x201C;You ask who I&#x2019;m talking about? Then right now, listen well. I&#x2019;m talking about you. You are an outsider.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You speak nonsense!&#x201D; Chu Feng was enraged as he spoke furiously. He didn&#x2019;t care whether he was a senior or not.</span></p><p><span style="">*bang* But then, out of nowhere, You Mingdeng suddenly gripped Chu Feng&#x2019;s shoulder, flicked it, pressed Chu Feng onto the ground, then grabbed Chu Feng&#x2019;s robe, ripping it, thus revealing his sturdy back.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, everyone felt confused as to what You Mingdeng was doing, but after he pointed at Chu Feng&#x2019;s back, and said his following words, they understood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;On your back, I do not see the incomplete black moon, the symbol of the Crippling Night Demon Sect! On what basis are you saying you&#x2019;re a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect?!&#x201D; You Mingdeng loudly questioned.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master, there&#x2019;s a reason the symbol cannot be imprinted on Chu Feng,&#x201D; You Tonghan hurriedly explained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Shut up! The Earth King has told me about Chu Feng, but no matter why, as long as the incomplete black moon cannot be imprinted, that person is not a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect!&#x201D; You Mingdeng appeared especially heartless, then pointed at Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you know so many of my Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s secrets, and you even possess a Royal Armament and Secret Skills. I have already shown you kindness by leaving you alive. I hope you know what&#x2019;s best for you. If you dare to inhibit any malicious intents, I will not be this polite the next time we meet.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, he extended his palm, and a burst of suction power surged out. It drew away Chu Feng&#x2019;s badge into You Mingdeng&#x2019;s hand&#x2014;it was the badge the Earth King gave him.</span></p><p><span style="">After putting it away, You Mingdeng looked at the crowd, and shouted with an extremely fierce tone, &#x201C;From today on, all of you mark your borders clearly with this Chu Feng. Listen up! He is not a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. You are not allowed to associate with him in any way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Xuan Xiaochao and the others had very unpleasant expressions. They couldn&#x2019;t help but cast their gazes at Chu Feng. They seemed to want to say something, but in the end, they said nothing.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh* Just at that moment, You Mingdeng waved his big sleeve, and after a burst of a gale, he had brought Xuan Xiaochao and the others away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you all right?&#x201D; After You Mingdeng and the other left, Qiushui Fuyan helped Chu Feng up, who was lying on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="">After Chu Feng climbed up, he first looked at her body full of wounds, and the shame in his heart immediately surged forth. He said, &#x201C;Senior Qiushui, I am truly sorry. In order to help me, you&#x2019;ve been harmed to this extent.&#x201D; Chu Feng felt very ashamed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A little wound like this is nothing. It is merely an external injury.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan sweetly smiled at Chu Feng&#x2019;s embarrassed gaze, and forced an appearance that made it seem nothing had happened. Then, she said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;But this time, at least you know what the Crippling Night Demon Sect is truly like, right?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You Mingdeng is not the only who&#x2019;s like this. Even Xue Xiyue and Fu Liansheng are the same.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No matter how others from the Crippling Night Demon Sect support you, as long as those three dislike you, you will never gain a footing in the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, you don&#x2019;t need to worry because the Crippling Night Demon Sect has always been like this. If their internal portion was united, they wouldn&#x2019;t have fallen to this state.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Actually, You Mingdeng is quite correct. He has truly shown you kindness by leaving you alive, because to a person with his nature, it is truly unimaginable to suppress their desire for your Royal Armament.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Perhaps he did that because of the things you&#x2019;ve done for the Crippling Night Demon Sect. However, you are really too outstanding. So outstanding that it threatens their very position in the Crippling Night Demon Sect. He won&#x2019;t allow you to rise in power&#x2014;or, at least, he won&#x2019;t allow you to rise in power in the Crippling Night Demon Sect, because that would impede his goal to sit on the position of sect head.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After hearing Qiushui Fuyan&#x2019;s words, Chu Feng went silent. How could he not understand what Qiushui Fuyan was trying to say?</span></p><p><span style="">In reality, long before today, Chu Feng had anticipated a day like this would occur because from the very start, Qiu Canfeng had hiddenly warned Chu Feng to be wary of You Mingdeng and Xue Xiyue. Of the Three Protectors, only Fu Liansheng could be trusted.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet, until this very day, Chu Feng had still done quite a few things for the Crippling Night Demon Sect, especially so today. He had come from quite the distance and risked death in order to save them. Yet, in the end, he was treated in such a manner. If he said it was fine and if he said he was not angry, those were definitely lies.</span></p><p><span style="">But even so, Chu Feng could not sever his relationship with the Crippling Night Demon Sect. It was for no other reason but because he still had to save Qiu Canfeng. For Qiu Canfeng, he could only endure, because only after seeing Fu Liansheng and saving Qiu Canfeng could Chu Feng rid himself of his relation with the Crippling Night Demon Sect in reassurance, and do the things he wanted to do.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
