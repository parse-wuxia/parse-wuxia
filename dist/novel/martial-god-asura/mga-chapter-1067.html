<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1067 - I&#x2019;m Not Telling You</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Release my hand. My business is not something that you can interfere in.&#x201D; Seeing that there was actually someone who decided to stop him, and that person was a Southern Cyanwood Forest disciple on top of that, a displeased expression appeared on the angry face of that Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciple. He waved his arm and tried to shake off Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s arm was as rigid as steel. Even though that Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciple used a great amount of strength, he was unable to shake off Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Release her.&#x201D; Chu Feng spoke with a calm voice. However, there was a faint trace of deterrence within his voice.</p><p>Moreover, at this moment, Chu Feng had already begun to slightly increase the strength of his hand&#x2019;s grip which gave an enormous pressure on the wrist of that Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciple. He even felt a sensation that his wrist was about to break.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that the situation wasn&#x2019;t good, even though that Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciple was unwilling to, he still hurriedly released the little girl. That was because a lot of people were gathered here. As a core disciple of the Orion Monastery, he did not want to shame himself before the crowd.</p><p>Seeing this, the little girl hurriedly ran away from the Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciple and hid behind Chu Feng. She tightly grabbed Chu Feng&#x2019;s clothes with her little hands. It was as if she had grabbed onto her savior. Her timid appearance was truly lovable.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know this girl?&#x201D; Suddenly, someone asked. It was not the man who caught the little girl. However, this person was also a disciple of the Orion Monastery.</p><p>There were a lot of people from the Orion Monastery. At this moment, practically all of the surrounding people were from the Orion Monastery. Moreover, regardless of whether they were men or women, they were all looking at Chu Feng with ill intended gazes.</p><p>&#x201C;Not at all.&#x201D; Chu Feng shook his head. No matter how oppressive his opponents were, Chu Feng was still as calm as ever. There was not the slightest trace of fear in his face.</p><p>&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t know her, then why did you meddle in our business?&#x201D; Another disciple from the Orion Monastery shouted. Moreover, at this moment, more and more disciples from the Orion Monastery came over. Judging from their appearance, it seemed as if they were trying to overwhelm Chu Feng with their oppressiveness.</p><p>&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded from the crowd. Upon hearing this voice, the disciples of the Orion Monastery immediately moved aside. At this moment, Chu Feng and the others saw a beautiful and elegant young man walking over from the crowd.</p><p>When this person appeared, the people of the Orion Monastery all displayed expressions of reverence. One could tell that the identity of this person was definitely extraordinary.</p><p>As for this person, he was someone that Chu Feng and the others have seen before; one of this year&#x2019;s most outstanding genius disciple of the Orion Monastery, Yuan Qing.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Yuan Qing, that girl stole the medicines handed to me by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. I planned to snatch it back from her but who would&#x2019;ve thought that this Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s disciple decided to shield that girl for no reason at all.&#x201D; Seeing Yuan Qing&#x2019;s appearance, that disciple who had his medicinal pellets stolen hurriedly complained to Yuan Qing.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Hearing what had happened, Yuan Qing cast his gaze over to Chu Feng. His gaze contained a clear sense of displeasure.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s merely medicinal pellets. I&#x2019;ll give mine to you, so stop making things difficult for a little girl.&#x201D; Chu Feng knew that the medicinal pellets had already been swallowed by the little girl. Thus, he directly threw the three medicinal pellets in his hand over to them.</p><p>Upon seeing the medicinal pellets in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand, that disciple&#x2019;s eyes shined. He extended his hand and received those medicinal pellets. However, who would&#x2019;ve thought that, right at this moment, Yuan Qing suddenly grabbed his wrist and stopped his movement. He then said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;You think that we would let things be after you return what was stolen from us? If things could be solved that easily, would the law of the land even exist anymore?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What do you want then?&#x201D; Seeing that they were unwilling to forgive, a trace of displeasure flashed through Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. While this Yuan Qing might be a genius to the others, he was not anyone special in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;What I want? You&#x2019;re the thief here, yet you&#x2019;re acting like you&#x2019;re in the right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. You&#x2019;re shielding a thief! Yet you dare to act so unyielding! Did you take our Orion Monastery to be the Black Python Stronghold?! We are not a power that would allow you to bully us as you wish!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng actually dared to talk back, the disciples of the Orion Monastery all displayed angry expressions. There were even some who had already exposed their killing intent toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Yuan Qing, I am the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Punishment Elder Gongsun Kuo.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;She is, after all, a child. Even if she had stolen your medicines, it must&#x2019;ve been done unintentionally. How about giving this old one here some face and let her go? What do you think?&#x201D; Seeing that the situation was turning bad, Elder Gongsun hurriedly stood out.</p><p>&#x201C;Since even an elder like you have spoken, I would definitely give you the face. However, elder, you are unrelated with this girl, why are you so inclined to care about this matter? Someone as experienced as yourself ought to know that it is best to not meddle in another&#x2019;s business. You must definitely not bring about calamity upon yourself because of mere ignorant heroism.&#x201D; After Yuan Qing said those words, he turned around and left.</p><p>Seeing this, that Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciple immediately took the medicinal pellets from Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand. Then, the Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciples coldly snorted and gave Chu Feng angry gazes before turning around to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Huuu~~&#x201D; After the people from the Orion Monastery left, Elder Gongsun heaved a long sigh of relief. Then, with a worried expression, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;m afraid that you&#x2019;ve brought trouble upon yourself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The people from the Orion Monastery are not to be trifled with. Although they would not dare to do anything to you here because there is the deterrence of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, but once you leave this place, they would dare to do any and everything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Especially you. In the future, you would be entering the Cyanwood Mountain as disciples. At that time, they would inevitably point their spearheads towards you all. Adding on how powerful the Orion Monastery is in the Cyanwood Mountain, if they were to truly harbor ill intent for you, then your days in the Cyanwood Mountain might become difficult.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Gongsun, does the Cyanwood Mountain allow for their disciples to fight each other at will?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course they would not allow for it. However, everyone knows that the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain would compete with one another either openly or secretly. The competition among the core disciples is even more distinct. Thus, sometimes the Cyanwood Mountain would also turn a blind eye to what might be happening.&#x201D; Said Elder Gongsun.</p><p>&#x201C;As long as they do not dare to act in the open, everything would be fine. Furthermore, if they truly were to refuse to let such a small matter go, I would let them know that I, Chu Feng, is not that easily bullied.&#x201D; Although he knew that his previous actions might have created a great enemy for himself, Chu Feng did not display the slightest trace of fear on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Sigh. I hope that to be the case. However, even though our Southern Cyanwood Forest had been in decline for many years, we still possess some connections in the Cyanwood Mountain. If they truly planned to harm you, they would, at the very most, only be able to make things difficult for you and not be able to bring about dangers to your life.&#x201D; Said Elder Gongsun.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, where did that little girl go?&#x201D; Suddenly, Elder Gongsun looked behind Chu Feng and said in shock.</p><p>&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s pupils suddenly shrunk. A shocked expression emerged on his face. He was surprised to discover that the little girl hiding behind him had disappeared. Moreover, he did not even notice her disappearance in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201D; Right at this moment, a young and sweet voice sounded from a place not far away. Turning his gaze to look, it was that little girl. Moreover, at this moment, the little girl had her hands behind her back and was walking toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh, my name&#x2019;s Chu Feng, what&#x2019;s your name?&#x201D; Chu Feng bent down and asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh. So your name&#x2019;s Chu Feng? Very well. Chu Feng, thank you for helping me. Consider this as my thanks.&#x201D; The little girl stuffed a Cosmos Sack into Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>After inspecting the items within the Cosmos Sack, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes shined. When he managed to react, he discovered that the little girl was currently walking towards the crowd with her hands behind her back.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey, little lady, you haven&#x2019;t told me your name yet.&#x201D; Seeing this, Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face.</p><p>Hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s question, that little girl turned around and exposed a sweet and slightly naughty smile. She said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not telling you.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, the little girl turned around and skipped into the crowd. Judging from her appearance, she appeared to be in a good mood.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
