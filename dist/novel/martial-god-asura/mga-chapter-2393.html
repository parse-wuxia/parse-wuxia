<p><strong> Chapter 2393 - Doubt In One&#x2019;s Heart</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Kong Cheng, did Chu Feng and the others cause you your injuries?&#x201D; Kong Zheng walked over to Kong Cheng and asked.</p><p>&#x201C;No, it wasn&#x2019;t them. This was caused by that monster. However, my injuries were not deliberately caused by that monster. Rather, it was because I was careless,&#x201D; Kong Cheng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Monster?&#x201D; Hearing those words, that Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder turned his gaze to the direction of the surging pond water.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, with a shift of his body and a flutter of his clothes, he dove directly into the pond water filled with surging energy ripples.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of a True Immortal,&#x201D; Seeing that scene, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze changed.</p><p>The location where that Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder dove into was the center of the explosion. Although there were still frightening energy ripples wreaking havoc in that region that caused Chu Feng and the others to not dare approach that location, that Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder was able to completely disregard the violently surging energy ripples.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, weren&#x2019;t you extremely arrogant before?! Why are you silent now?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And you, you damned bitch! Did you not place our Kong Heavenly Clan in your eyes?! Didn&#x2019;t you look down on our Heavenly Bloodline?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why are you not acting vigorous and overbearing now?!&#x201D;</p><p>Kong Zheng arrived before Chu Feng and the others and began to wave his hands around while denouncing them. His appearance was precisely one of a dog threatening another by relying on its master&#x2019;s power.</p><p>&#x201C;Pah!&#x201D; Right at that moment, Zhao Hong actually spit at Kong Zheng.</p><p>Everything happened too quickly. Furthermore, that Kong Zheng had never expected for Zhao Hong to dare to spit at him in such a situation.</p><p>Thus, he was caught off guard, and Zhao Hong&#x2019;s spit landed directly on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;You! You damned bitch! I&#x2019;ll beat you to death!&#x201D; Kong Zheng was furious. He swung his arm and shot a ruthless slap towards Zhao Hong&#x2019;s cheek.</p><p>However, a burst of oppressive might suddenly swept forth. Kong Zheng let out an &#x2018;ouch&#x2019; sound and then began to roll in midair. He was sent flying several thousand meters away from Chu Feng and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, not to mention Kong Zheng, even Chu Feng and the others had surprised expressions on their faces. The reason for that was because that oppressive might came from behind Chu Feng, from the experts of the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Have you all gone insane? Why did you all attack me instead of taking care of them?!&#x201D; Kong Zheng crawled back up. As he was extremely furious, he actually spoke rudely toward his seniors.</p><p>&#x201C;Kong Zheng, do not be rude,&#x201D; Right at that moment, that True Immortal-level expert had flown out from the pond and returned to where he previously stood.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, it is not that this junior is rude, but rather those seniors are bullying me. That damned bitch bullied me. Yet, instead of helping me take care of that bitch, they actually helped her. I truly&#x2026;&#x201D; Kong Zheng half-kneeled in midair and spoke with an expression filled with grievances.</p><p>&#x201C;Kong Zheng, what I mean is that you are not allowed to be rude towards little friend Chu Feng and his friends,&#x201D; That Utmost Exalted Elder said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?!!!&#x201D; Hearing those words, Kong Zheng&#x2019;s body trembled. Then, his eyes opened wide, and his mouth froze. His appearance was as if he had been struck by lightning. His appearance showed that he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>What sort of situation was this? Hadn&#x2019;t he requested that these elders come so that they could take care of Chu Feng and the others?</p><p>Yet now, why was it that these seniors did not help him get revenge, and instead started to lecture him?</p><p>&#x201C;Little friends, this old man is called Kong Shunlian. I am an Utmost Exalted Elder of the Kong Heavenly Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I know about all of the misunderstandings that had occurred between you and our Kong Heavenly Clan. Here, on behalf of our Kong Heavenly Clan, this old man apologizes to three little friends. I hope that three little friends will not take our wrongs to heart,&#x201D; As that Kong Shunlian spoke, he actually bowed to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, what are you&#x2026;&#x201D; Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng were completely stunned.</p><p>This person here was Kong Shunlian, an Utmost Exalted Elder of the Kong Heavenly Clan. Among the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan, he was an existence of unsurpassed status. With the seniority he possessed, even the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief would have to be respectful towards him.</p><p>Never had they ever seen this grand character lower his head to someone else. It was simply something impossible.</p><p>Furthermore, he was lowering his head to three people of the younger generation?</p><p>&#x201C;You two, shut up. The two of you have been strolling about outside all year round. Most likely, you still don&#x2019;t know about the past achievements of little friends Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, right?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although you all are members of the younger generation, there are simply light-years between you two and the three of them,&#x201D; Right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Kong Zheng and Kong Cheng&#x2019;s ears. It was from a Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder. He was also the person that had attacked Kong Zheng earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elder, we&#x2026;&#x201D; Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng felt at a complete loss. The two of them had heard about the things regarding Chu Feng. In fact, they had heard a lot of things regarding him.</p><p>However, if they judged merely by the things that Chu Feng had done in the past, there shouldn&#x2019;t be a reason for this elder to say that the two of them could not compare to Chu Feng, nor would it be reasonable for their supreme Utmost Exalted Elder to apologize and bow respectfully to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>Although Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng were both hot-headed individuals, the two of them were no fools. At that moment, the two of them realized that it seemed like they didn&#x2019;t know about certain things.</p><p>Then, the elder who had sent the voice transmission to Kong Zheng and Kong Cheng began to narrate to them what had happened in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.</p><p>Upon finding out that Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang had managed to obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds before all those experts, and that they even managed to save all the grand characters present from the Infant Soul Sect, Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng felt as if their minds had gone completely blank. They simply did not dare to believe it all</p><p>However, after seeing the way their Utmost Exalted Elder treated Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, the two of them had no choice but to believe it.</p><p>If Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had not really managed to accomplish the impossible, how could their Utmost Exalted Elder apologize to them?</p><p>Upon beginning to trust what that elder said to be true, Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng began to feel lingering fear.</p><p>If they had no idea what sort of opponent they were facing before, then they knew very well what sort of opponent they faced now.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, you are being too serious. While it is true that there were some misunderstandings back then, they were only misunderstandings. We will not take them to heart,&#x201D; Chu Feng was surprised to see that the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder did not have any malice toward him.</p><p>Furthermore, with his status, that Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder actually still offered an apology to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, three people of the younger generation. As such, if Chu Feng was to refuse to accept that apology, he would truly appear to not know how to appreciate favors.</p><p>That said, Chu Feng was very concerned about the status of that humanoid clay monster. Thus, he asked, &#x201C;Senior, I wish to ask, have you managed to find traces of that monster after entering the pond?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When I entered the pond earlier to inspect it, I discovered that there was a very powerful formation inside the pond. However, that spirit formation had already been destroyed. Furthermore, I am also unable to distinguish what level of world spiritist created that spirit formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for that so-called monster, I only managed to detect some aura. However, the aura was very disorderly. I think that monster is most likely dead,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s dead?&#x201D; After hearing that, Chu Feng actually felt some sentiment in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, I wanted to ask you, little friend Chu Feng, how did that monster die?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I guess it could be considered to be suicide,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s actually suicide?!&#x201D; Upon hearing those words, the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan all revealed surprised expressions.</p><p>Likely, they had already obtained a rough understanding of the situation at hand here from Kong Zheng.</p><p>It was true that the monster was malicious earlier. Furthermore, when someone like Kong Zheng began to narrate the situation to them, he would most definitely add details to his story. Likely, the experts from the Kong Heavenly Clan must be holding a very bad impression of that monster.</p><p>Yet now, that monster had actually committed suicide. As such, how could they not be surprised?</p><p>&#x201C;To be exact, it was trying to refine the power contained in the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, but ended up being unable to withstand the power, and died from an explosion of its body.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I felt that trying to refine power that one cannot grasp and dying because of that is no different from suicide,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What little friend Chu Feng says is reasonable,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Since the crisis has been resolved and our misunderstandings settled, seniors, we will take our leave now,&#x201D; Chu Feng clasped his fist to Kong Shunlian and prepared to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, please wait,&#x201D; However, that Kong Shunlian suddenly spoke. He said, &#x201C;Actually, this old man has come here with a presumptuous request. That is, I wish to invite little friend Chu Feng and your friends to our Kong Heavenly Clan as guests.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng was surprised.</p><p>He truly never thought that the Kong Heavenly Clan would invite them as guests.</p><p>The location of the treasures on the treasure map he obtained from Grandmaster Kai Hong was precisely located in the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s territory.</p><p>And now, the Kong Heavenly Clan actually wanted to invite them to be guests. This was an extremely rare opportunity.</p><p>Merely, Chu Feng did not trust this Kong Heavenly Clan. In fact, Chu Feng was on guard against this Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder the entire time too.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng truly did not know how to answer this invitation.</p><p>The reason for that was because he wanted to go, but also didn&#x2019;t want to go.</p><p>He wanted to go because of the treasures.</p><p>Yet he didn&#x2019;t want to go because he feared that the Kong Heavenly Clan might be plotting something.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
