<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1390 - Meeting Sima Ying Again</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Senior Ma, is there anything else you need?&#x201D; Chu Feng turned around to ask.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d almost forgotten this,&#x201D; With a smile on his face, Old Village Chief Ma walked over to Chu Feng and handed the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to him. He said, &#x201C;This item is now little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng saw the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter and remembered how Old Village Chief Ma had used the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to increase the power of his world spirit techniques to battle with Sun Feiyang, Chu Feng felt that it was more suitable for this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to be left with Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>Thus, in a magnanimous manner, he said, &#x201C;The Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter is too precious. If it were left with me, I fear that it would not be safe. Thus, Old Village Chief Ma, please help me safeguard it.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng said those words with ingenuity. Although he was trying to return the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to Old Village Chief Ma, he did not want to say it too obviously.</p><p>After all, by saying that, this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter would still be Chu Feng&#x2019;s. If he were to need it in the future, he could come and take it at any time. However, in reality, Chu Feng did not plan to take the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter back. Even though this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter was extremely precious, when comparing treasures to relationships, Chu Feng cared more about relationships.</p><p>For example, when comparing Old Village Chief Ma and the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter, Chu Feng was more concerned about Old Village Chief Ma. Even though Old Village Chief Ma had wrongly accused him, as matters stood, he did not have the slightest trace of resentment for Old Village Chief Ma. In fact, he even felt a great amount of respect and gratefulness toward him.</p><p>Upon thinking about how this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter was a precious treasure that Old Village Chief Ma had only managed to obtain after paying the price of his future prospects, Chu Feng knew that this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter possessed a special importance to him. Thus, Chu Feng felt that the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter should be left with Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>&#x201C;For little friend to be able to obtain the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter means that you and it have been brought together by fate. Furthermore, I believe that little friend Chu Feng will be able to protect the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter. Thus, little friend Chu Feng, it would be better for you to have it,&#x201D; Old Village Chief Ma seemed to know what Chu Feng&#x2019;s intentions were. However, he still shook his head with a smile and insisted on returning the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to Chu Feng.</p><p>Right at this time, Miao Renlong spoke with a smile on his face, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, since even Village Chief Ma has said it like that, you should accept the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter. Although it is dangerous to protect a treasure, it is sometimes beneficial to one&#x2019;s growth too.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Protecting a treasure has the same principles as protecting one&#x2019;s close relatives. I believe, with little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s moral character, the significance of close relatives is most definitely much broader than that of treasures.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if you are not able to protect even treasures, then how will you be able to protect your close relatives?&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing what the two of them said, Chu Feng realized their intentions. Miao Renlong had given a very good example, and Old Village Chief Ma also insisted on returning the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to Chu Feng. Thus, it would be improper for Chu Feng to continue to refuse. As such, he accepted the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter and placed it into his bosom.</p><p>After this, Chu Feng began to proceed toward the World Spiritist Alliance with Miao Renlong. Chu Feng was very much looking forward to this journey.</p><p>If Han Helai was the person who had stolen the Sealing Glacier, then not only would he be able to obtain the opportunity to retrieve the Sealing Glacier, seal the Natural Oddity in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest and greatly increase his cultivation, he would also be able to help Sima Ying obtain her revenge against her greatest enemy.</p><p>In other words, this would be killing two birds with one stone. Just thinking about it caused him immense joy. [1. GNE: Isn&#x2019;t it like four? :P Xima: shhh don&#x2019;t question bees plot armor lol.]</p><p>As for Miao Renlong, he seemed to be very interested in Chu Feng&#x2019;s origins. On their journey back to the World Spiritist Alliance, he chatted with Chu Feng about many things. As for Chu Feng, he did not try to conceal anything, and told Miao Renlong about how he was from the Eastern Sea Region, as well as all the things he had experienced after coming to the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>After learning about Chu Feng&#x2019;s experiences, Miao Renlong became even more appreciative of Chu Feng. He felt that Chu Feng had received even more challenges when compared to the other geniuses of the Holy Land of Martialism, and that the difficulty of his journey had been even greater.</p><p>On their journey to the World Spiritist Alliance, Chu Feng experienced how great Miao Renlong was. Miao Renlong&#x2019;s speed was extremely fast. Although the Sealing Ancient Village and the World Spiritist Alliance were both located in the Alliance Domain&#x2019;s central region, there was still quite a large distance separating them.</p><p>Logically, the two of them should have been going through teleportation formations to hasten their journey. Yet, Miao Renlong decided to walk.</p><p>However, being led by Miao Renlong, Chu Feng arrived in the World Spiritist Alliance after only several days.</p><p>A speed like this was not at all slower than taking the Ancient Era&#x2019;s teleportation formations. It was truly unimaginable. This caused Chu Feng to wonder what sort of speed a Martial Emperor would possess when a peak Half Martial Emperor&#x2019;s speed was already this fast. Wouldn&#x2019;t it mean that a Martial Emperor would be able to travel through the entire Holy Land of Martialism in barely any time?</p><p>After arriving in the World Spiritist Alliance, although Chu Feng had experienced a lot of different places, he was still surprised by the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s ingenious design.</p><p>The World Spiritist Alliance was constructed in the depths of the underground. Chu Feng had originally expected it to be an enormous underground palace. However, he now knew that he had underestimated the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>It was an independent world. There were blue skies, white clouds, boundless earth, mountains and even rivers. In short, everything was present in this place.</p><p>Furthermore, there were a lot of plants and animals that Chu Feng had never seen before in this place.</p><p>To be exact, all of the plants in this place possessed medicinal properties, and all of the animals in this place possessed special uses, either capable of being used to concoct medicines or refine weaponry. In short, neither the plants nor the animals were as simple as being only ornamental.</p><p>The items that were seen to be the most precious treasures in the Azure Province of the Nine Provinces Continent, the spirit medicines and even the profound medicines, were like ordinary flowers and plants in this place where they covered the mountains and earth.</p><p>This led to this stand-alone space possessing an abundant amount of Natural Energy even denser than the world outside. This place was truly a sacred place for mental and spiritual cultivation.</p><p>As for the buildings of this place, they too were unique and distinctive in style. All of them were made with white bricks and white tiles. Regardless of their shape, they were all white in color.</p><p>A multi-colored backdrop accompanied by white buildings, it must be said that this gave off a special sort of beauty.</p><p>&#x201C;So beautiful. This place is most definitely the most beautiful place that I&#x2019;ve ever been to,&#x201D; Chu Feng gasped in admiration. At this moment, Chu Feng was standing in front of a palace and admiring the beautiful scenery before him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng,&#x201D; Right at this moment, a sweet voice sounded from behind Chu Feng.</p><p>When hearing this voice, Chu Feng felt delighted in his heart. That was because this voice was none other than Sima Ying&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>Chu Feng turned his head around. Sure enough, Sima Ying was standing behind him. At this moment, Sima Ying was wearing a world spiritist&#x2019;s gold cloak. Her red hair was tied up in a ponytail behind her back. It was a very pretty appearance.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow, you&#x2019;re already a rank six Martial King?! Isn&#x2019;t this speed a bit too quick? It would seem that I will soon be surpassed by you,&#x201D; Sima Ying walked over to Chu Feng and then displayed an expression of shock and happiness.</p><p>&#x201C;I thought I had already caught up to you. Seems like I was mistaken,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. He discovered that Sima Ying&#x2019;s cultivation had increased too. She was no longer a rank six Martial King, and was now instead a rank seven Martial King.</p><p>Although Chu Feng was a rank six Martial King now, Sima Ying&#x2019;s cultivation was still a level above Chu Feng&#x2019;s.</p><p>With how young Sima Ying was and how quick her speed of breakthrough was, even Chu Feng felt a sense of inferiority.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh, what has increased is not only limited to my cultivation. My world spirit techniques have also increased. If we are to compete in world spirit techniques now, I might not necessarily lose to you,&#x201D; Sima Ying&#x2019;s eyes narrowed into two sweet-looking crescents. At the same time, a confident smile appeared on her face.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
