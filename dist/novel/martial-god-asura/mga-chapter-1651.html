<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1651 - Four Great Secret Skills</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Earthen Taboo: Thousand Spearhead Slash!&#x201D; Nangong Tianshi was completely infuriated by Chu Feng. This time around, he was not using an ordinary attack. Instead, he used an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill from the get-go.</p><p>Earthen Taboo Martial Skills were very powerful to begin with. When an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill was unleashed with the power of an Incomplete Imperial Armament like the Purple Rainbow Sword, its strengthened might was something that one could well imagine.</p><p>At this moment, over a thousand purple blade rays appeared simultaneously. They formed an inescapable net formed by blade rays. With a speed ten times faster than before, they charged toward Chu Feng. If Chu Feng were to be hit by the blade rays, he would definitely meet a horrible death with his body dismembered into ten thousand pieces.</p><p>However, even when facing such an attack, Chu Feng still had a smile on his face. Then, light began to flash underneath his feet and he disappeared like a phantom. Merely by relying on his pair of boots, Chu Feng dodged Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s fatal attack again.</p><p>&#x201C;While your martial skill appears to be quite powerful, unfortunately, it is completely useless. Once again, you are unable to land a single slash on me,&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s figure appeared in the distance. With a smile on his face, he looked to Nangong Tianshi. His gaze was filled with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;Continue smiling, I shall see whether you&#x2019;ll be able to smile after this,&#x201D; Suddenly, Nangong Tianshi brandished the Purple Rainbow Sword in his hand. When a purple blade ray shot toward him again, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression immediately took a huge change.</p><p>The reason for that was because Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s slash was not shot toward Chu Feng. Rather, it was shot toward Nangong Moli.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng had already set up a defensive spirit formation for Nangong Moli, his world spirit formation, regardless of how powerful it might be, would not be able to withstand Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s slash.</p><p>If this slash were to hit, not only would it shatter Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit formation, it would also undoubtedly kill Nangong Moli.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In this sort of situation, Chu Feng did not hesitate. The boots on his feet immediately shone with light. In a flash, Chu Feng arrived before Nangong moli.</p><p>Right at this moment, that sharp slash had arrived.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In an instant, a large explosion spread throughout an area of several miles. Following it, energy ripples began to sweep across the horizon. Like an enormous purple cloud, the energy ripples lingered in midair.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph&#x2026; in terms of tricks, you&#x2019;re still lacking.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Tianshi was immensely pleased with himself. The reason for that was because he was certain that his slash had successfully landed on Chu Feng. As long as it landed on Chu Feng, he was certain that Chu Feng would not be able to resist his slash.</p><p>Even if Chu Feng were lucky and did not die, he would definitely lose the ability to continue fighting.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D; However, at the moment when the purple energy ripples began to gradually dissipate, Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s eyes started to shine, and his expression took a huge change.</p><p>As more and more energy ripples dissipated, Chu Feng&#x2019;s appearance became clearer and clearer, and Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s expression became more and more brilliant. His complexion had turned pale, and his lips were trembling. He was clearly deeply frightened.</p><p>At this moment, not only was Chu Feng completely unharmed, there were four auras lingering around his body. These four auras were four different colors, and possessed four different forms.</p><p>There was a white tiger, an azure dragon, a black tortoise, and a fiery red phoenix.</p><p>They were four powerful beasts. At this moment, they all appeared on Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. They were coming out of Chu Feng&#x2019;s body.</p><p>It would be one thing if it was only the four beasts that appeared. However, the four powerful auras that appeared alongside the beasts frightened Nangong Tianshi immensely.</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Tianshi felt that even though Chu Feng still possessed the cultivation of a rank three Half Martial Emperor, his battle power had absolutely surpassed his own.</p><p>This was naturally because of the Four Great Secret Skills that Chu Feng had grasped. The Azure Dragon, the Vermillion Bird, the White Tiger, and the Black Tortoise.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng was not only the enemy of the Beitang Imperial Clan, he was also the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s wanted criminal. He felt that his current situation was extremely bad. Thus, there was no longer a need to conceal his Four Great Secret Skills.</p><p>With the increase of Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation, the might of Chu Feng&#x2019;s Four Great Secret Skills was also incomparable from before.</p><p>Currently, not only was Chu Feng able to use the Four Great Secret Skills simultaneously, they were also capable of making him unstoppable. While none of the Four Great Secret Skills were comparable to the Water Immortal Profound Technique by themselves, when they were used simultaneously and fused with Chu Feng, where he could use them as he wished, the might of the Four Great Secret Skills most definitely surpassed that of the Water Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>The White Tiger possessed enormous offensive power. The Black Tortoise possessed enormous defensive power. The Azure Dragon possessed enormous speed. The Vermillion Bird possessed enormous healing power.</p><p>When these four different powers fused together with Chu Feng, they simply allowed Chu Feng to become invincible. When fighting someone of the same battle power, with the assistance of these Four Great Secret Skills, how could there possibly be anyone capable of contending against Chu Feng?</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; what exactly are you?!&#x201D; Faced with such a Chu Feng, Nangong Tianshi revealed an appearance of fear. His legs grew weak, and he began to involuntarily move backwards.</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Tianshi suddenly felt that the person before him was not a human at all. Rather, he was a monster. If he wasn&#x2019;t a monster, how could there be the auras of four different monsters lingering around him?</p><p>However, their auras seemed to resemble the Water Immortal Profound Technique a lot. It was the aura of secret skills. Nangong Tianshi firmly believed that what Chu Feng had used right now were definitely secret skills.</p><p>However, it was one thing for Chu Feng to obtain the Water Immortal Profound Technique. Yet, suddenly, Chu Feng was now actually revealing that he controlled four other secret skills in addition to the Water Immortal Profound Technique. This was something that Nangong Tianshi was unable to accept.</p><p>&#x201C;I seem to remember you saying that you were going to reveal your true strength.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, I will return those words to you. This is my, Chu Feng&#x2019;s, true strength.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng smiled coldly. Then, a dragon roar sounded, and Chu Feng instantly disappeared. When he reappeared, Chu Feng was already behind Nangong Tianshi.</p><p>A white tiger&#x2019;s claw grabbed onto Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s Purple Rainbow Sword. Then, Chu Feng ruthlessly shot a fist into Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s chest, causing him to vomit blood and suffer a serious wound.</p><p>After his first fist strike, Chu Feng continued to throw more fists. All of his fists landed onto Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>While none of the fists were fatal, each one of them caused Nangong Tianshi to feel enormous pain, so much pain that he wished he was dead. After several fist strikes, Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s entire body was covered with blood and he lost consciousness.</p><p>After he lost consciousness, he also lost the ability to continue standing in the air. Thus, he fell from the sky and ruthlessly crashed into the ground.</p><p>However, even though he had fallen to the ground, his Purple Rainbow Sword was still being held by that White Tiger&#x2019;s claw.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard! You dared to injure my third brother! I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D; All of this was seen by Nangong Tianhu. In an incomparable rage, he began to attack the Water Immortal Profound Technique frantically. He was trying to eliminate the Water Immortal Profound Technique as quickly as possible so that he could avenge his third brother.</p><p>However, even though the Water Immortal Profound Technique was no longer a match for Nangong Tianhu, it possessed a frightening power of restoration. Every time it was destroyed by Nangong Tianhu, it would immediately be reborn. This caused Nangong Tianhu an enormous headache. Even though he was able to suppress the Water Immortal Profound Technique, he was unable to break free from it at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, the Water Immortal Profound technique suddenly turned into a jet of water and shot into Chu Feng&#x2019;s forehead. Just like that, it disappeared.</p><p>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had taken back the Water Immortal Profound Technique.</p><p>He was planning to face Nangong Tianhu alone for a decisive battle. In other words, he planned to take care of Nangong Tianhu himself.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
