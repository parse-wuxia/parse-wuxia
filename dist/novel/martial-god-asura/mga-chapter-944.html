<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 944&#xA0;- Furiously Pulling out the Demon Sealing Sword</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lord Protector, no need to trouble yourself with worry.&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly smiled. He didn&#x2019;t thank nor bow to You Mingdeng and just walked straight towards the formation in large strides.</span></p><p><span style="">Many people only saw Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions as a joke. No one treated him seriously.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when Chu Feng entered the formation and, without change in expression nor speed, continued forward at an unbelievable rate&#x2014;through the tenth layer, ninth layer, eighth layer, and seventh layer&#x2014;no one could remain calm anymore.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s happening? How can this brat walk through so many layers without any pressure?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Not to mention others, even You Mingdeng, Xue Xiyue, and Fu Liansheng, the Three Protectors, changed their faces greatly. They had personally laid that formation. They knew the strength it contained.</span></p><p><span style="">Even Xuan Xiaochao and the others were under enormous pressure and were limited at the fifth layer, so how could this brat pass through so many effortlessly?</span></p><p><span style="">Before the crowd&#x2019;s stunned gazes, Chu Feng still walked with ease. He continued advancing forward without the slightest decrease in tempo. He went through the sixth layer, fifth layer, and the fourth layer that even the Protectors&#x2019; disciples couldn&#x2019;t enter, still without a change in expression nor a drop in speed. He seemed as if he were walking on normal ground as he felt no pressure at all.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! This is unbelievable! How did he do it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The observers felt their scalps go numb and chilly winds blow past their spines. They felt it to be so inconceivable, because Chu Feng still looked so relaxed despite it being the fourth layer.</span></p><p><span style="">Recollecting Xuan Xiaochao&#x2019;s and the others&#x2019; performance earlier, they truly felt stupefied.</span></p><p><span style="">After arriving at the fourth layer, Chu Feng stopped moving. &#x201C;Lord Protector, is this the formation you&#x2019;re using to choose the new sect head? It&#x2019;s rather disappointing,&#x201D; he said mockingly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; You Mingdeng was so furious he gritted his teeth, but he didn&#x2019;t know how to retort. He could only angrily clench his fists and tremble in rage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Impossible! It&#x2019;s impossible he entered the fourth layer so easily! Something must have gone wrong with this formation!&#x201D; You Tonghan couldn&#x2019;t tolerate his master being humiliated.</span></p><p><span style="">After a deep breath, he dashed forward and ran straight into the formation. However, just after he stepped into the fifth layer, he let out a painful cry. He was forced out by its immense power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Han&#x2019;er!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">You Mingdeng&#x2019;s expression changed greatly. You Tonghan&#x2019;s descent was quickly softened, but because he had been too careless, he was struck by an extremely powerful force. He had been knocked unconscious by the pressure of the formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026; Heavens! The formation&#x2019;s power hasn&#x2019;t diminished! With this person&#x2019;s own strength, he walked to the fourth layer!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s unbelievable! Who is he? Why have I never heard of such a monster in the Crippling Night Demon Sect?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">You Tonghan&#x2019;s actions undoubtedly brought alarm amongst the crowd&#x2014;it told them the formation hadn&#x2019;t been changed. It was still that horrifying. This nameless brat was able to walk to the fourth layer because his own abilities were too strong.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng helplessly sighed. They had quite a decent relationship, so he didn&#x2019;t wish harm to fall upon him.</span></p><p><span style="">But there was nothing that could be done, nor could You Tonghan be blamed for his rashness. After all, Chu Feng had been insulting his master. If it were another person who insulted Chu Feng&#x2019;s master, he too would not tolerate it.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Chu Feng had showed himself in front of You Mingdeng to do exactly that&#x2014;to throw him into a fit of rage. As such, he couldn&#x2019;t pay much attention to You Tonghan. As he looked at You Mingdeng, he said with a few chuckles, &#x201C;Lord Protector, it seems that this position of substitute sect head will be changed.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, Chu Feng turned around and continued forward. He, amidst stunned and devastated gazes, passed through the third layer, second layer, and in a straight path came to the first layer.</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone was dumbstruck. Even Xue Xiyue&#x2019;s and Fu Liansheng&#x2019;s eyes were bursting with astonishment.</span></p><p><span style="">But Chu Feng clearly didn&#x2019;t plan to stop just there. He looked over You Mingdeng, Xue Xiyue, and Fu Liansheng, then asked, &#x201C;Lord Protectors, Lord Sect Head proclaimed whoever pulled out this Demon Sealing Sword could become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Xue Xiyue and You Mingdeng tightly furrowed their brows, and both remained silent.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Fu Liansheng faintly smiled, and said, &#x201C;That is true. Sect Head had said regardless of the person, as long as they pull out the Demon Sealing Sword, they could become sect head.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then, if someone does become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, does it mean the three of you also need to listen to their command?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course. The sect head is the leader of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Not to mention us, everyone in the Crippling Night Demon Sect must follow their command. They are not permitted to disobey,&#x201D; Fu Liansheng said as he nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s true, then I won&#x2019;t become substitute sect head. It&#x2019;ll just be more worth it to become sect head.&#x201D; Chu Feng chuckled, and as he spoke, he even cast his gaze towards the nearby Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How arrogant. Even we Four Protectors weren&#x2019;t able to pull out this Demon Sealing Sword. Do you think </span><i><span style="">you</span></i><span style=""> can?&#x201D; Xue Xiyue spoke. Her tone was very mocking&#x2014;mocking Chu Feng&#x2019;s ignorance.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Xue Xiyue is correct. The Demon Sealing Sword is very powerful. I&#x2019;d advise you to avoid contact with it, otherwise if it&#x2019;s unhappy and kills you, even we can do nothing about it,&#x201D; You Mingdeng said in a threatening manner.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is not up to you, but up to me,&#x201D; Chu Feng sneered, then, before the gazes of the crowd, he held out his palm, and placed it on the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom*</span></p><p><span style="">In the instant Chu Feng grasped the Demon Sealing Sword, layers upon layers of boundless auras swept out like a hurricane, the Demon Sealing Sword akin to its eye.</span></p><p><span style="">The auras were so powerful many people were unable to withstand it. They were forced back, and even the entire palace violently shook.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! He truly wants to pull out the Demon Sealing Sword! He&#x2019;s too daring!&#x201D; The members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect were quite frightened.</span></p><p><span style="">If Chu Feng&#x2019;s previous actions merely shocked them, Chu Feng&#x2019;s current actions completely terrified them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh, this is indeed a good sword. Let me become your master!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng made a smile. As he spoke, he clenched his hand, and fiercely waved his arm. After a clank, the entire earth trembled. A heavy object had been pulled up from the ground, and was held in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng had drawn out the pitch-black Demon Sealing Sword from the formation.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
