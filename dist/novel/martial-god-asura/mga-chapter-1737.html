<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1737 - Say It Again</strong></p><p>Hearing those words, Nangong Beidou, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Avaricious Immortal were all startled. None of them expected for the Compass Immortal to refuse such extravagant treatment.</p><p>Right at this moment, Baili Xuankong suddenly shouted, &#x201C;Break through the heavenly dome!!!&#x201D;</p><p>With his shout, the Death Kill Brush in his hand started to shine brighter. Golden light radiated all over like the sun. Then, the golden light exploded in midair.</p><p>The powerful impulse pushed back even the three rank three Martial Emperors. The aftermath of the attack gradually sprinkled downward. Even though it was incomparably gorgeous, it brought about great fear to the crowd like the descent of the reaper.</p><p>The aftermath of that explosion was too powerful. If it were to land onto the surface, the majority of the crowd would likely be hit with a calamity.</p><p>Those below rank three Martial Emperor would either die or be gravely injured.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, the Compass Immortal waved his sleeve and brought about a burst of wind. The wind swept toward the horizon and blew all of the golden rays of light away instantly.</p><p>When the golden rays of light disappeared, Baili Xuankong and Chu Feng were already gone. All that remained were the ashen complexions of Nangong Beidou, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Avaricious Immortal.</p><p>Even with the three of them working together, they were actually unable to stop a man of the same cultivation. At that moment, they had lost all face.</p><p>However, at that moment, the crowd had all cast their gazes onto the Compass Immortal.</p><p>Compass Immortal&#x2019;s previous attack had already shown to the crowd how powerful he was. If he had been willing to stop Chu Feng, Chu Feng would definitely not have escaped.</p><p>Thus, the crowd was truly unable to understand why the Compass Immortal did not stop Chu Feng and that mysterious expert when he could easily have done so.</p><p>Why he had decided to miss out on the great opportunity provided by Nangong Beidou?</p><p>&#x201C;For you all to let Chu Feng escape today, you will definitely regret your decision in the future,&#x201D; Suddenly, Nangong Beidou turned his gaze downward toward the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the White-browed Immortal.</p><p>Facing that gaze, the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Beitang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief only curled their lips and smiled. They were naturally not afraid of Nangong Beidou.</p><p>As for the White-browed Immortal, his heart tightened. After being stunned for so long, he finally woke up.</p><p>However, after waking up, he felt enormous pain and despair.</p><p>Chu Feng had not died. Not only did this mean that he had failed, most importantly, before Chu Feng had revealed his identity, he had actually been filled with that much admiration for Chu Feng.</p><p>At this moment, he was feeling extremely unwell. He had admired&#x2026; a person whom he had looked down upon and wanted to eliminate before. This sort of sensation was something that only he understood.</p><p>&#x201C;White-brow, exactly why were you stunned earlier?&#x201D; Nangong Beidou landed from the sky and spoke fiercely to the White-browed Immortal. He was truly angry.</p><p>When Chu Feng had defeated his two sons and revealed his heaven-defying talent, he had thought that it would be a great disaster should Chu Feng be alive, that he must find a way to alleviate the situation and reconcile with Chu Feng.</p><p>At that time, the White-browed Immortal had insisted to him that he must not reconcile with Chu Feng, and must instead eliminate him.</p><p>Today, the disaster had came to fruition. Even if he wished to reconcile with Chu Feng, he would not be able to. However, White-browed Immortal had actually stood there and watched all this go on without helping him take care of Chu Feng. As such, how could he not be angered?</p><p>Not only had the White-browed Immortal brought harm to him, he even didn&#x2019;t help him during his time of need. Nangong Beidou only restrained himself because the White-browed Immortal was one of the Ten Immortals and still had his uses. Otherwise, he would definitely have smacked him to death with a palm strike.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Nangong, I&#x2026;&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal wanted to explain. However, in the end, he was unable to say anything, and could only sigh. Then, he grew silent.</p><p>&#x201C;Sigh, what a pity. To have that Chu Feng escape, I fear that I will not be able to be at ease in the future,&#x201D; At this moment, the Avaricious Immortal also sighed.</p><p>Then, he turned to Nangong Beidou and the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and said, &#x201C;Even though we didn&#x2019;t manage to kill that Chu Feng and allowed him to escape, I also set him up as an enemy. Thus, you two best not refuse to provide me with the Incomplete Imperial Armaments you promised.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Tianlong, hand over your Blue Rainbow Sword,&#x201D; Nangong Beidou said to Nangong Tianlong.</p><p>&#x201C;Father, I&#x2026;&#x201D; hearing those words, Nangong Tianlong&#x2019;s complexion turned ashen.</p><p>&#x201C;I said hand it over,&#x201D; Nangong Beidou shouted angrily.</p><p>Hearing that, Nangong Tianlong did not dare to hesitate, and immediately took out his Blue Rainbow Sword and handed it to Nangong Beidou.</p><p>&#x201C;Avaricious, I know you&#x2019;ve always wanted this Blue Rainbow Sword. I&#x2019;ll satisfy you and hand it to you. However, it currently belongs to my son. Thus, when you sever the connection between them, make sure to not injure him,&#x201D; Nangong Beidou handed the Blue Rainbow Sword to the Avaricious Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, to me, that is a trivial matter,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal laughed mischievously as he received the Blue Rainbow Sword. After obtaining the Blue Rainbow Sword, he gently moved his hand above it. Immediately, a golden light streak across the sword.</p><p>When that golden light streaked through the sword, Nangong Tianlong&#x2019;s legs grew weak. He took two steps back, and his complexion grew as pale as paper. However, more than anything, he had an expression of sadness on his face. Evidently, the Blue Rainbow Sword no longer belonged to him.</p><p>After that, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief also took out an Incomplete Imperial Armament and handed it to the Avaricious Immortal.</p><p>At the moment when he handed the Incomplete Imperial Armament to the Avaricious Immortal, he felt as if his heart were bleeding. Not only did he not manage to kill Chu Feng, he had also suffered the loss of an Incomplete Imperial Armament. He had truly lost enormously from this.</p><p>&#x201C;Yin Chengkong! Look at the disciple you&#x2019;ve taught!!&#x201D; Suddenly, Nangong Beidou pointed his finger in the direction of the people who had come from the Cyanwood Mountain. His finger was directly aimed at the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly&#x2019;s Assembly Master, Yin Chengkong.</p><p>Facing this, Yin Chengkong started to frown. With even him frowning, the complexion of the rest of the people from the Cyanwood Mountain had all turned ashen. Some of the elders were so scared that they began to tremble with fear.</p><p>Judging from this, it was clear that Nangong Beidou already knew that Chu Feng was their Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s disciple.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng had managed to escape, the Cyanwood Mountain would not be able to escape. At this moment, both the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Ximen Imperial Clan were filled with anger. Judging from their attitudes, it seemed that they were planning to vent their anger on them.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng has long been expelled from our Cyanwood Mountain. He is already no longer someone of our Cyanwood Mountain. Clan Chief Nangong, what might be the meaning behind those words you&#x2019;ve said?&#x201D; Yin Chengkong pretended to be calm as he said those words.</p><p>&#x201C;Expelled? Did you think you would be able to escape responsibility just because he&#x2019;s been expelled from your Cyanwood Mountain? Did you think that after you&#x2019;ve nurtured a demon, you will be able to abstain from all responsibilities just because you broke off your relationship with him?&#x201D; The Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said angrily.</p><p>Hearing those words, the people of the Cyanwood Mountain who were worried to begin with became even more worried. It seemed that they had guessed correctly. The Nangong Imperial Clan and the Ximen Imperial Clan had suffered enormously from Chu Feng and were filled with anger, and they now planned to vent their anger on the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Chiefs, the Cyanwood Mountain is such an enormous power with countless disciples. It is also beyond their control for a disciple like Chu Feng to appear there.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I feel that they have already done an extraordinary feat to break off all relationships with Chu Feng in a prompt fashion. After all, Chu Feng has never really committed any bloody atrocities that offend the heavens.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, you all should stop making things difficult on the Cyanwood Mountain. Else, you&#x2019;ll only appear to be the strong bullying the weak, and become the people&#x2019;s laughingstock,&#x201D; The Compass Immortal said those words as he sipped on the tea from the teacup in his hand.</p><p>Hearing those words, the brows of Nangong Beidou and the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief started to narrow. They began to reveal expressions of displeasure. Earlier, the Compass Immortal had refused to help them. And now, he was even speaking out for the Cyanwood Mountain. Exactly what was his intention?</p><p>&#x201C;Compass Immortal, exactly what is the relationship between you and that Chu Feng? Why did you refuse to help us capture him earlier, and why are you speaking to absolve the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s relationship now?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal, who had disliked the Compass Immortal to begin with, immediately seized this opportunity to sow dissension. He was planning to borrow the strength of the Ximen Imperial Clan and the Nangong Imperial Clan to take care of the Compass Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, the Compass Immortal laughed lightly. He placed the teacup in his hand onto the table beside him, stood up, looked to the Avaricious Immortal and said, &#x201C;Say it again.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
