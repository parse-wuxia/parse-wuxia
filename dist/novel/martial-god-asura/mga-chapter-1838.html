<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1838 - Brother Being Plotted Against By Others</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Senior, what sort of mistake did Jiang Wushang make to cause him to be punished in such a place?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Stealing,&#x201D; Yin Gongfu said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did he steal?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Items beneficial to one&#x2019;s cultivation,&#x201D; Yin Gongfu said.</p><p>&#x201C;Might that be a mistake?&#x201D; Chu Feng did not believe that. From his understanding of Jiang Wushang, he believed that Jiang Wushang was someone who would absolutely not do something like that.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s definite proof. He was caught red-handed. Although he refused to admit to it, as per the rules of this place, I had no choice but to punish him,&#x201D; Yin Gongfu said. From his tone, Chu Feng was able to tell that it seemed like Yin Gongfu also did not wish to punish Jiang Wushang.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, am I allowed to go and talk to him?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Normally, you could not. However, if you wish to, then go ahead,&#x201D; Yin Gongfu said.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng immediately leapt forward and arrived in the mine. After he entered the mine, Chu Feng immediately felt a pressure from it. Merely, this pressure did not affect Chu Feng much.</p><p>&#x201C;Little brother Wushang,&#x201D; Chu Feng landed directly beside Jiang Wushang.</p><p>Hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s voice, Jiang Wushang had an extremely shocked and almost petrified expression. Immediately afterward, he hurriedly turned around to look.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, it&#x2019;s really you?&#x201D; Upon seeing Chu Feng, Jiang Wushang was immediately overjoyed, and started to smile beamingly. He let go of his pick and hugged Chu Feng tightly.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s me. Little brother Wushang, I&#x2019;ve finally found you,&#x201D; Chu Feng also tightly hugged Jiang Wushang.</p><p>The two brothers had been separated for many years. And now, they had managed to reunite with one another in a foreign land. This emotion that they were feeling was something that only the two of them understood.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, why are you here?&#x201D; Jiang Wushang asked in a very emotional manner.</p><p>&#x201C;I came to know of your whereabouts from senior brother Zhang,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Tianyi? Haha, big brother Tianyi is amazing right now. It turned out that his father is actually Emperor Gong&#x2019;s successor. No, that&#x2019;s wrong. Big brother Tianyi is Emperor Gong&#x2019;s successor now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, even with that, my idol still remains you, big brother Chu Feng. I have heard about all the things relating to you, especially what happened at the Gong Ba Plains recently.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, I can only say that you&#x2019;re truly amazing. You are the pride of this brother of yours,&#x201D; Jiang Wushang smiled brilliantly. He already knew about the various things regarding Chu Feng. However, he did not ask about who had been in the wrong. The reason for that was because he felt that Chu Feng was most definitely the one in the right.</p><p>&#x201C;Little brother Wushang, I&#x2019;ve heard that you are being punished because you stole something?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, do you believe that?&#x201D; Jiang Wushang asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course not. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m asking you. Exactly what happened? Senior brother Zhang told me that you came here to train. Why is it that when I arrived, you&#x2019;re actually undergoing punishment?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>Jiang Wushang sighed. &#x201C;What else could have happened? Your little brother is a fool. I have been had by others,&#x201D; he smiled bitterly.</p><p>&#x201C;Come here,&#x201D; Chu Feng pulled Jiang Wushang to the side. Then, he asked, &#x201C;Exactly what happened? If you are to tell me, I might be able to help you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Forget about it. You have enough trouble to deal with. I do not wish to burden you with more. Things here are not as simple as you imagine them to be. You shouldn&#x2019;t bother with it,&#x201D; Jiang Wushang shook his head. Then, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, I am extremely happy to be able to see you.&#x201D; After saying those words, Jiang Wushang&#x2019;s eyes began to tear up.</p><p>Back then, Jiang Wushang had been a youngster. However, he was already a grown man now. Real men did not cry easily. He was also one such person. Jiang Wushang had always been a very strong person.</p><p>However, all these years of perseverance, all these years of suffering and pain, how could he possibly enjoy them? How could he possibly not feel grievances?</p><p>He naturally felt grievances, naturally felt unwell. Especially after being framed by others and ending up in such a state, he was feeling extremely pained, extremely wronged. Merely, as a man, he could not cry and, had to endure all of it.</p><p>However, when he saw Chu Feng, it was as if he had seen the person that he could depend on. Before the person that he could depend on, Jiang Wushang&#x2019;s stubbornness collapsed right away. He had revealed his frail side.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Wushang acting like this, Chu Feng felt extremely begrieved. He patted Jiang Wushang&#x2019;s shoulder and said, &#x201C;If you think of me as your brother, tell me. Else, I will forcibly bring you away right now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, you&#x2026;&#x201D; Jiang Wushang became stunned. He didn&#x2019;t know what to do.</p><p>&#x201C;Little brother Wushang, you know how I am. I am someone who will do what I say. Regardless of how extraordinary the master of this place is, I will still not allow him to make things difficult on my brother. If worst comes to worst, I&#x2019;ll just die,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he tightly grabbed onto Jiang Wushang&#x2019;s shoulder. He was planning to soar into the air with Jiang Wushang.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t. Big brother Chu Feng, I&#x2019;ll tell you,&#x201D; Seeing that, Jiang Wushang hurriedly spoke. He knew that Chu Feng was really someone who would do what he said. If Chu Feng were to truly create trouble in this place, he would have implicated Chu Feng.</p><p>With no other choice, Jiang Wushang ended up telling Chu Feng what had happened. Chu Feng also came to learn the truth.</p><p>Back then, Jiang Wushang had been introduced to train in this place by Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s father. The reason for that was because the master of this place possessed a grand origin, and was also someone who possessed an extremely pure Imperial Bloodline. Most importantly, he was not someone from the Four Great Imperial Clans.</p><p>His name was Duan Jidao. Duan Jidao was someone from the Duan Royal Clan. Although he came from a Royal Clan that was inferior to the Imperial Clans, he was an existence that even the Three Palaces feared. As for the Four Great Imperial Clans, there was simply no need to mention them.</p><p>As he possessed an Imperial Bloodline, and his Imperial Bloodline was extremely pure, he had, by himself, turned the Duan Royal Clan into the Duan Dynasty. Back then, the Duan Dynasty had been extremely famous and powerful. They were capable of bringing fear to the people of the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>At that time, the Four Great Imperial Clans greatly feared him. They were all afraid that the Duan Dynasty would threaten their Four Great Imperial Clan&apos;s&#x2019; status. In actuality, with Duan Jidao&#x2019;s ability, he was indeed capable of doing so.</p><p>However, suddenly, one day, the Duan Dynasty was wiped out. After that, Duan Jidao also disappeared.</p><p>When Duan Jidao reappeared after many years had passed, his face was covered with a beard, and he had become a white-haired old man. His appearance of being covered with white hair made him resemble a madman. Even though he used to be extremely famous back then, no one was able to recognize him without him mentioning who he was.</p><p>Afterward, Duan Jidao arrived at this place. Not only did he seize the territory of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, he also began to find people abandoned by the Imperial Clans, as well as outstanding members of the younger generation from the various Royal Clans, to grant them Imperial Bloodlines and nurture them here.</p><p>Duan Jidao did all of this for the sake of finding a successor. Thus, after Jiang Wushang arrived in this place and found out about this, he worked extremely hard. Because of that, Jiang Wushang began to be thought of highly by Duan Jidao.</p><p>Everyone felt that Jiang Wushang would be one of the very few people who would have a chance to become Duan Jidao&#x2019;s successor.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jiang Wushang had been incautious when making friends, and ended up falling for a trap that someone else had set up.</p><p>That person&#x2019;s name was Song Yuheng. He was the person said to have the greatest possibility of becoming Duan Jidao&#x2019;s successor. He was also the person that Duan Jidao thought the most highly of.</p><p>Song Yuheng was already over a hundred years old. He was no longer considered to be part of the younger generation. However, he had ended up becoming Jiang Wushang&#x2019;s friend.</p><p>That day, he invited Jiang Wushang to be a guest at his palace. Furthermore, when Jiang Wushang was leaving, he presented Jiang Wushang with a gift.</p><p>However, on that exact day, Jiang Wushang was wrongly accused of stealing Song Yuheng&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s inherited treasure. After a search, that treasure was indeed discovered in Jiang Wushang&#x2019;s residence.</p><p>It turned out that treasure was the gift that Song Yuheng had given Jiang Wushang. Jiang Wushang had been unable to explain himself. Just like that, he had been wrongly accused, lost all of his great future prospects, and sent here to mine for a year as punishment.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
