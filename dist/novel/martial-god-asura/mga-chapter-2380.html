<p><strong> Chapter 2380 - Immovable</strong></p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re still alive?&#x201D;</p><p>Ma Yue and Tian Yi had astonished expressions on their faces. Neither of them dared to believe that they were still alive.</p><p>After all, the two of them were so close to the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Thus, they had truly felt the terror of that Divine Tribulation&#x2019;s lightning.</p><p>It was an indescribable terror. If they had to describe it, then it would be the sort of terror that would be their eternal nightmare.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026; exactly what is going on?&#x201D;</p><p>After a moment of astonishment, Ma Yue and Tian Yi cast their gazes to the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p><p>At that moment, their gazes had changed. They felt with even greater certainty that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was unfathomable.</p><p>They felt that the frightening lightning must have been caused by the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p><p>To be able to give rise to such frightening lightning, it better signified how powerful the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, several figures flew over and descended outside the altar.</p><p>As for those people, they were none other than Kong Zheng, Hu Xuanyi and the other elders.</p><p>&#x201C;We pay our respect to Lord Elders!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing those people, the people from the Lower Realms did not dare to show any negligence. They immediately knelt on the ground and greeted them respectfully.</p><p>Furthermore, they possessed very nervous expressions on their faces. Especially when facing Hu Xuanyi, they did not dare to look him in the face.</p><p>Although Hu Xuanyi was a peak Half Martial Ancestor like all the other elders, Hu Xuanyi possessed a special status in the guardian clan. As such, he possessed enormous authority in the Hundred Refinements Stage. It could be said that he was the elder that the people from the Lower Realms feared the most.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you all notice the descent of two lightning strikes earlier? Exactly where did those two bolts of lightning fall?&#x201D; Hu Xuanyi directly asked the crowd.</p><p>The reason for that was because they had seen that the two lightnings had both descended at the altar.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elders, we did indeed see them. Those lightning bolts were caused by the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone,&#x201D; Zhou Zongzhi&#x2019;s voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhou Zongzhi?&#x201D; The elders turned toward the direction of the voices, and were immediately shocked.</p><p>The reason for that was because not only was Zhou Zongzhi beaten beyond recognition and covered in blood, he did not even possess the strength to stand up. As he spoke, he started to crawl towards them. That appearance of his was truly miserable.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhou Zongzhi, how did you end up in this state? Who injured you?&#x201D; Seeing such a Zhou Zongzhi, the elders were all very shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be&#x2026;&#x201D; Suddenly, an elder thought of something. Then, he turned his gaze to Ma Yue and shouted angrily, &#x201C;Ma Yue, how could you be this vicious?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are you a fool?! Zhou Zongzhi is now a rank four Half Martial Ancestor, whereas Ma Yue is still only a rank three Half Martial Ancestor. How could Ma Yue beat Zhou Zongzhi to such a state?&#x201D; Hu Xuanyi said.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026;&#x201D; That elder who shouted at Ma Yue started to look around. His intention was clear. He felt that there was no one else here other than Ma Yue who would attack Zhou Zongzhi like so.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elders, while it is true that I was not injured by Ma Yue, the person who injured me is deeply related to Ma Yue,&#x201D; Zhou Zongzhi seized the opportunity to report on Ma Yue.</p><p>&#x201C;Related to Ma Yue? Someone that is able to injure you and is related to Ma Yue? Who is it? Speak immediately!!!&#x201D; An elder declared.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait. Leave this matter for now. Zhou Zongzhi, you said that the frightning lightning was caused by the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, why did the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone change its location all of a sudden?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly what is going on? Tell me everything truthfully,&#x201D; Hu Xuanyi said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elders, this is what happened&#x2026;&#x201D; Zhou Zongzhi began to narrate what happened in full detail to Hu Xuanyi and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re saying that a person who declared himself to be from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm arrived in this place and moved the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Then, he infuriated the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone and was refined by it. Then, the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone caused those two lightning strikes?&#x201D; Hu Xuanyi asked with a face filled with astonishment. He didn&#x2019;t really believe what Zhou Zongzhi said. Not only him, the other elders also didn&#x2019;t really believe Zhou Zongzhi.</p><p>Not mentioning whether or not the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was able to cause that lightning, the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was something that was immovable by anyone. As such, how could that guy Zhou Zongzhi described possibly be able to move it?</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elders, what I&#x2019;ve described is absolutely true. This Zhou Zongzhi would not dare to deceive Lord Elders!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you all don&#x2019;t trust me, you can go and ask them. They are able to bear witness to all of it,&#x201D; Zhou Zongzhi said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elders, it is as big brother Zhou said. Everything was caused by that person who proclaimed himself to have been from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm,&#x201D; The crowd echoed.</p><p>&#x201C;Describe the appearance of that guy to me,&#x201D; Right at that moment, Kong Zheng stood forth.</p><p>&#x201C;This person is?&#x201D; Faced with an unfamiliar face, Zhou Zongzhi and the others started to hesitate.</p><p>&#x201C;He is Young Master Kong Zheng of the Kong Heavenly Clan. Answer all his questions honestly,&#x201D; Hu Xuanyi ordered.</p><p>&#x201C;So it&#x2019;s actually Young Master Kong Zheng of the Kong Heavenly Clan. This lowly one has eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. I hope that Young Master Kong Zheng will not blame me,&#x201D; At that moment, Zhou Zongzhi hurriedly greeted Kong Zheng to admit his mistake.</p><p>&#x201C;We pay our respects to Young Master Kong Zheng,&#x201D; At the same time, the others also started to respectfully greet Kong Zheng.</p><p>Even though they had been in the Hundred Refinements Stage the entire time, they knew about the situation outside. As such, they naturally knew that the Kong Heavenly Clan was among the four strongest powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>It could be said that the Kong Heavenly Clan was a colossus that they dreamed of having connections with.</p><p>And now, a young master of that powerful colossus was before them; how could they possibly dare to show any disrespect?</p><p>&#x201C;Enough superfluous words. Speak immediately,&#x201D; Kong Zheng looked down on Zhou Zongzhi and the others from the bottom of his heart. Thus, regardless of how they treated him, he would still hold them in contempt.</p><p>That said, Zhou Zongzhi did not dare to show negligence toward Kong Zheng. Thus, he hurriedly described Chu Feng&#x2019;s appearance to Kong Zheng and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be?!&#x201D; After hearing Zhou Zongzhi&#x2019;s description, Kong Zheng&#x2019;s expression changed immediately. Then, he looked to Hu Xuanyi and revealed an angry expression. He said, &#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t you say that Chu Feng would absolutely not be able to come in here? How is it that he&#x2019;s in here? Furthermore, he arrived here before me!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re saying that the man who proclaimed himself to have been from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm and moved the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is that Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s impossible! Before you entered, the Hundred Refinements Stage&#x2019;s entrance had not been opened. It should be impossible for him to have entered here,&#x201D; Hu Xuanyi had an astonished expression.</p><p>&#x201C;It truly hadn&#x2019;t been opened before?&#x201D; Kong Zheng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It hadn&#x2019;t. Absolutely not,&#x201D; Before Hu Xuanyi could answer, the others elders spoke in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that it isn&#x2019;t Chu Feng then? But&#x2026; that description truly resembled that Chu Feng,&#x201D; At that moment, Kong Zheng&#x2019;s eyes were flickering non-stop with bewilderment.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget about it. It doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore. I&#x2019;ve come here precisely for the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Regardless of what might have happened, it will all be fine as long as this Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is still here,&#x201D; As Kong Zheng spoke, he began to move toward the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Master Kong Zheng, don&#x2019;t go over there. If it is truly as they declared, if the lightning really was caused by the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, it would mean that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is currently extremely dangerous. It is best that you do not approach it,&#x201D; Hu Xuanyi stopped Kong Zheng.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, regardless of how dangerous it is, I must still take it. No one will be able to stop me,&#x201D; Kong Zheng was determined. He disregarded Hu Xuanyi and the others&#x2019; advice and proceeded toward the altar with large strides.</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that the guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief has deceived me. No one is able to move you? Didn&#x2019;t you already get moved?&#x201D; Kong Zheng looked to the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone and revealed a faint smile.</p><p>Originally, he had had a trace of worry in his heart. He was afraid that he would not be able to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. After all, he had guaranteed that he would be able to move it before arriving at the altar Thus, if he were to fail, it would be extremely humiliating.</p><p>However, he no longer had the slightest bit of worry anymore. Being extremely confident, he felt that since someone else was capable of moving it, he would definitely be able to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone too.</p><p>Kong Zheng then raised his sleeve and lowered his back. With overwhelming confidence, he placed his hands onto the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn?&#x201D;</p><p>However, at that moment, Kong Zheng&#x2019;s expression changed. He started to panic.</p><p>He was shocked to discover that he was unable to lift that seemingly normal stone.</p><p>&#x201C;I refuse to believe this!&#x201D;</p><p>After a declaration, lightning flickered in Kong Zheng&#x2019;s eyes. Not only did he activate his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, he had also utilized a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill capable of increasing his strength.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing! Is this the legendary Heavenly Bloodline?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of a Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s young master. His power is simply too astonishing!!!&#x201D;</p><p>After seeing the lighting unleashed by Kong Zheng, Zhou Zongzhi and the others began to praise him nonstop. At that moment, they did not feel the slightest doubt towards Kong Zheng&#x2019;s ability. They all felt that Kong Zheng would definitely be able to lift the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p><p>After all, someone else had already accomplished it earlier.</p><p>They felt that since someone from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm was able to do it, an exceptional genius like Kong Zheng would definitely be able to do it too.</p><p>&#x201C;Heeaaahh!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Before the attentive gazes of the crowd, Kong Zheng suddenly shouted. Following that, a burst of boundless aura was emitted from his body.</p><p>At that moment, Kong Zheng&#x2019;s veins bulged, and his entire body turned red. He unleashed all of his power in that split second.</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D;</p><p>However, at that moment, the crowd were stupefied. They were at a complete loss.</p><p>The reason for that was because even though Kong Zheng had unleashed such overwhelming might and used such powerful abilities, the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone did not move in the slightest.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
