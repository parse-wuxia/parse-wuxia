<p><strong> Chapter 2288 - Chu Feng&#x2019;s Value</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Haha, nothing is too bizarre in this world. Actually, within the territory of our Sunset Cloud Valley, in a place called the Darknight Ghost Forest, there also exists a demonic woman that would only feed on men like the one that has appeared in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Our Sunset Cloud Valley has even removed the demonic women many times. Unfortunately, we are unable to exterminate them completely. Every so often, another demonic woman will appear,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said.</p><p>&#x201C;I think that those so-called demonic women are only martial cultivators that have trained in a special sort of demonic technique. It is actually not surprising at all,&#x201D; Su Jingrui added.</p><p>Hearing till this point, Chu Feng realized that even though the demonic women have been appearing in the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s territory the entire time, the Sunset Cloud Valley did not have much of an understanding toward the demonic women.</p><p>In fact, they did not even know that the demonic woman in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds originated from their territory.</p><p>However, it was understandable, since the strength of the demonic women was always limited. It was only when the powers surrounding the Darknight Ghost Forest were unable to handle the demonic women that they would ask for assistance from the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p><p>Likely, the demonic women would immediately be killed once the Sunset Cloud Valley dispatched their experts to take care of the demonic women. As such, it was normal for them to not be concerned with the demonic women. After all, they had never considered the demonic women as a threat.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master,&#x201D; Right at that moment, someone shouted from outside the palace.</p><p>&#x201C;DIdn&#x2019;t I said to not disturb me unless there are important matters?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said in a slightly annoyed manner.</p><p>When Chu Feng created a major commotion when sparring against Kou Kang, Elders from the Sunset Cloud Valley had already arrived at the palace to inquire about what was happening.</p><p>As they were inquiring out of worry for the safety and well-being of the people in the palace, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master did not lash out at them. Instead, he merely told them that everything was fine and ordered them to withdraw.</p><p>However, there was clearly no commotion this time around. Yet, there were elders rushing over here to report something. As such, this caused the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master to become somewhat annoyed.</p><p>After all, the topic of their discussion right now was something that deeply interested him - it was concerning Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remnants. It might even be possible for him to obtain a great amount of benefits from this newest remnant.</p><p>As such, he would naturally be displeased to be annoyed at such a time.</p><p>&#x201C;Since you have already informed them not interrupt you unless something important has happened, perhaps something important has truly happened?&#x201D; Su Jingrui said.</p><p>Hearing what Su Jingrui said, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master felt that to be reasonable too. Thus, he waved his sleeve and opened the gates to the palace. He then said, &#x201C;Come in.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master,&#x201D; That elder walked in. He did not say anything, and immediately moved before the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master. With his back bent, he presented a letter to the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master.</p><p>The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master opened the letter and began to view its contents. Su Jingrui and the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster who stood beside him also turned their gazes to the letter out of curiosity.</p><p>Once they read the contents of the letter, the expressions of the three men immediately changed. After the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master folded the letter and put it away, the three men all looked to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve killed the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s son, Ying Liangchen?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked Chu Feng.</p><p>Once the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said those words, the expressions of Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu changed instantly. They both revealed expressions of panic.</p><p>Xu Yiyi, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others all knew that Chu Feng had killed Chu Luyang. However, they did not know that Chu Feng had killed the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s son.</p><p>Furthermore, the person he had killed was that Ying Liangchen.</p><p>Although Chu Luyang was a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Sunset Cloud Valley was not worried about his death, since the Chu Heavenly Clan did not care about the life and death of their members.</p><p>However, the Ying Heavenly Clan was different. The Ying Heavenly Clan was a second tier power in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They possessed strength that was not inferior to their Sunset Cloud Valley.</p><p>Furthermore, that Ying Liangchen that Chu Feng had killed was the most beloved son of the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>If that had truly happened, the Ying Heavenly Clan would definitely not let Chu Feng get away with it.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, such a thing did happen,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>Hearing those words, the crowd present all grew silent. The reason for that was because this was an extremely important matter.</p><p>&#x201C;Why did you kill him?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi asked in a very puzzled manner.</p><p>&#x201C;It was Ying Liangchen who extinguished the Red Butterfly Society&#x2019;s headquarters. Although he was asked to do so by Chu Luyang, it remained that he was the culprit. As such, how could I not kill him?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026; But&#x2026;.&#x201D; Xu Yiyi didn&#x2019;t know what to say to Chu Feng, and sighed.</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly what is going on here? Is there anyone willing to explain to me what is happening?&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster asked curiously.</p><p>After all, he still didn&#x2019;t know about the matter regarding Chu Feng and Chu Luyang.</p><p>Afterward, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master began to tell the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster about what had happened.</p><p>&#x201C;I do not think that little friend Chu Feng is in the wrong in this matter,&#x201D; After knowing about what had happened, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said firmly.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng is naturally not in the wrong. Merely, the crucial aspect is the Ying Heavenly Clan. They will not leave this matter be,&#x201D; Su Jingrui said with a frown.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master suddenly stood up. He fixed his gaze onto Chu Feng and said in a very serious manner, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, our Sunset Cloud Valley is willing to protect you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If the Ying Heavenly Clan insists on killing you, our Sunset Cloud Valley is willing to declare war against the Ying Heavenly Clan for you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Those words struck down like a sudden clap of thunder. Kou Kang was unable to contain his shock, and nearly sprayed out the wine in his mouth.</p><p>What sort of situation was this? The Sunset Cloud Valley was willing to declare war against the Ying Heavenly Clan for Chu Feng? One must know that the Ying Heavenly Clan was not a power that one could easily provoke.</p><p>Compared to Kou Kang&#x2019;s astonishment, Su Jingrui smiled lightly. He seemed to have already anticipated such a decision from the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master.</p><p>As for Xu Yiyi, she was not only astonished. More than shock, she was extremely excited and pleased beyond belief.</p><p>As she still did not know how valuable Chu Feng was, she had truly never expected that the Sunset Cloud Valley would be willing to go to war against the Ying Heavenly Clan for Chu Feng.</p><p>One must know that the Ying Heavenly Clan was an extremely strong power of influence. Compared to the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, the Ying Heavenly Clan was even more difficult to handle.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, this is a personal grudge between the Ying Heavenly Clan and myself. There is no need for the Sunset Cloud Valley to get involved in it&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you do not have to overthink it. Regardless of whether or not you will join our Sunset Cloud Valley, our Sunset Cloud Valley will always consider you to be our distinguished guest, to be our friend.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When a friend is met with a calamity, even if we must climb a mountain of blades or dive into a sea of flames, we will still not hesitate to do so. Thus, our Sunset Cloud Valley is determined to involve ourselves in this matter,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said resolutely.</p><p>After hearing those words, Kou Kang&#x2019;s expression grew even more unsightly.</p><p>He never expected the Sunset Cloud Valley to value Chu Feng so highly. Even though Chu Feng was not a member of the Sunset Cloud Valley, they were still willing to confront a power like the Ying Heavenly Clan for him.</p><p>If that was the case, it would truly be hopeless for him to obtain Xu Yiyi. The treatment Chu Feng had obtained was truly too grand. This indirectly illustrated that Chu Feng&#x2019;s status in the Sunset Cloud Valley was extremely high.</p><p>That sort of status was not something that he could compete against.</p><p>However, what brought Kou Kang even more despair was that, during this moment when he was astonished by how much the Sunset Cloud Valley valued Chu Feng, his master, the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster, actually also stood up.</p><p>&#x201C;Although I have only just met little friend Chu Feng, I also deeply admire little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s loyalty to his friends.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you were not in the wrong to begin with. It was that Ying Liangchen who deserved to die. If the Ying Heavenly Clan should be too overbearing toward you and insist on killing you for revenge, our Three Stars Hall is willing to direct justice and help you battle against the Ying Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said.</p><p>Once the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said those words, Kou Kang had an expression as if he was just fed feces. He was so astonished that he lost his grip on the cup of wine in his hand, dropping it onto the floor and shattering it.</p><p>In addition to Kou Kang, even the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui, who had a close relationship with the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster, were greatly shocked.</p><p>Although the Three Stars Hall and the Sunset Cloud Valley were allies, and the Three Stars Hall would provide support should the Sunset Cloud Valley have troubles, the words spoken by the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster were clearly not aimed at the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p><p>Rather, they were completely meant for Chu Feng.</p><p>Especially that &#x2018;help you battle against the Ying Heavenly Clan.&#x2019; That one phrase had completely illustrated his position.</p><p>The Three Stars Hall was planning to stand up for Chu Feng regardless of the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s position.</p><p>The reason for that was because this was how much value Chu Feng possessed to the Three Star Hall&#x2019;s headmaster.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
