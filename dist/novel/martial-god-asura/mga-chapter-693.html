<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 693 - Barely Victorious</strong></p><p><span style="">At first, everyone felt Chu Feng was most definitely dead. However, along with the elapse of time, they couldn&#x2019;t help gradually change such thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="">The three Mortal Taboo martial skill were extremely powerful, and the shock waves they formed were devastating; a glimpse would make one&#x2019;s heart quiver from fear. However, at that instant, Chu Feng was really still in the center of the shock waves, and had really defended against three Illusory Sword Thrusts. This made everyone even more shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">They were Mortal Taboo martial skills. Mortal Taboo martial skills! Even though Chu Feng&#x2019;s Secret Skill negated a portion of the martial skills&#x2019; power, they were still Mortal Taboo martial skills. Moreover, three rank five Martial Lords were clearly putting their full strength into the martial skills. How did Chu Feng block them with his physical body?</span></p><p><span style="">In a situation like that, everyone had to carefully observe Chu Feng&#x2019;s state of being through Spirit power. Only then did they discover a powerful shield surrounding Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. It was the shield that stopped the wild power of the Mortal Taboo martial skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;A Secret Skill! It&#x2019;s another Secret Skill! This guy actually grasps another Secret Skill! How is this possible? What sort of chance encounter did he stumble upon to procure such a harvest?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After confirming the reason behind Chu Feng&#x2019;s ability to stop the attack, everyone was even more shocked. Secret Skills were so exceptional, yet Chu Feng actually grasped two of them. How were they supposed to </span><i><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> be shocked?</span></p><p><span style="">However, when others felt shock upon discovered Chu Feng grasped two Secret Skills, Ya Fei&#x2019;s expression was much more complicated because she knew other than the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique before, as well as the Black Tortoise Armor Technique now, Chu Feng still grasped a third Secret Skill.</span></p><p><span style="">When things progressed up to this point, even she had to look at Chu Feng in a new perspective because his fighting strength and methods grasped truly surpassed her imagination. She had to look at him with serious eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let me see how long you can persevere for.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ya Fei, Murong Wan, use your full strength. We must defeat this child.&#x201D; Zhan Feng gnashed his teeth and shouted loudly. Then, he put forth all his power into the Illusory Sword Thrust, swearing to defeat Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">As for Ya Fei and Muong Wan, naturally they didn&#x2019;t dare to dally either. Gritting their teeth, they exhausted their final pieces of power. Risking their lives, they had to defeat Chu Feng Black Tortoise Armor Technique.</span></p><p><span style="">They had no choice but to act, because it was their final chance. It would never come again.</span></p><p><span style="">However, as time passed bit by bit, the power of the Illusory Sword Thrust had become weaker and weaker. The complexions of Ya Fei and the others were pale white. They were soaked in sweat, and had appearances akin to a dried out oil lamp. Yet, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Black Tortoise Armor Technique did not break.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit! I do not accept thissss!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, Zhan Feng furiously howled with his head raised and shortly after, he actually put away the silver greatsword in his hand. At the same time, his Illusory Sword Technique disappeared and his entire body swayed a bit in the air, then fell downwards.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lord Zhan Feng!&#x201D; Seeing that, Zhan Feng&#x2019;s rank four Martial Lord companion hurriedly flew over and caught him. Otherwise, he would have crashed onto the ground. At that instant, he didn&#x2019;t even have strength to stand up.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Ya Fei!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Miss Murong!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Simultaneously, Ya Fei and Murong Wan were completely drained of strength. Like Zhan Feng, they didn&#x2019;t even have the power to stand in the air and fell one after the other. They were caught by their companions and only then did they not fall onto the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, looking back at Chu Feng, though his Black Tortoise Armor Technique was slightly fainter in colour, it was still activated.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that, Chun Wu and Qiu Zhu both had faces full of joy. They were elated. Chu Feng truly defeated three peak geniuses of the Immortal Execution Archipelago with his own strength. If that were to spread outside, it would definitely shake the entire Eastern Sea Region.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm*</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that moment, the Black Tortoise Armor Technique abruptly dissipated. Chu Feng&#x2019;s whole appearance finally emerged before the crowd as well.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he at present did not have too great of a countenance either. Similarly, his face was deathly-white, lacking the slightly hint of blood. In comparison to before, his entire person seemed a lot skinnier. He even seemed that he was about to fall at any moment.</span></p><p><span style="">It could be seen that despite successfully defending against their attacks, Chu Feng himself still paid an enormous price.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Quick! Quickly go and kill this Wuqing! He no longer has any power, no ability to fight! Quickly kill him!&#x201D; Seeing that, Zhan Feng rejoiced. He hurried commanded his companions to take care of Chu Feng. When things arrived at that point, he hated every fibre of Chu Feng&#x2019;s being.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Go, kill him!&#x201D; At the same time, Ya Fei and Murong Wan also used fatigued voices to command their servants to finish Chu Feng off.</span></p><p><span style="">The three rank four Martial Lords were smart people so they naturally saw that Chu Feng was completely worn out and had no strength to fight.</span></p><p><span style="">So, after laying a Spirit Formation, surrounding Ya Fei, Murong Wan, and Zhan Feng in it, they rushed towards Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hahaha, even your masters cannot defeat me, yet you dare to be so insolent? You are truly looking to die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, just as the three, with powerful might, were about to near Chu Feng, his eyes flashed with a cold glare, then boundless Spirit Formation power surged out of his body.</span></p><p><span style="">The purple-coloured Spirit Formation power came pouncing over with aggressiveness, akin to a demon that could engulf everything. In only an instant, it surrounded the three rank four Martial Lords.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Crap, he still has such terrifying power!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Run, or else we will die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, the three of them were alarmed. Without even thinking, they quickly crushed their Immortal Talismans because if they didn&#x2019;t do that, they felt their lives would be gone.</span></p><p><span style="">After doing so, radiance flickered about their bodies, then they disappeared. They were sent back to the Misty Peak.</span></p><p><span style="">*poof*</span></p><p><span style="">In the instant the three of them disappeared, however, the blurry huge beast Chu Feng made from purple-coloured Spirit Formation actually disappeared like a whisper of smoke in the wind.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body fell down as well. In the end, he fiercely crashed onto the ground. But even so, a smug smile was still formed by Chu Feng&#x2019;s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;God damn, they were tricked, This guy used only an illusion.&#x201D; Seeing that, Murong Wan suddenly realized what happened and quivered in anger.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn, those three cowards! They were actually frightened by something like this and left us behind. When I return, I&#x2019;ll take care of them.&#x201D; As for Zhan Feng, he gritted his teeth in immense fury. So much it overwhelmed him, causing him to spray out of a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Wuqing!&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng fall, Chun Wu was instantly terrified. However, she could do nothing as the Spirit Formation Chu Feng laid was too powerful; she could simply not break it.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* But just at that moment, Chu Feng willed it to disappeared, and Chun Wu finally regained her freedom. She immediately came by Chu Feng&#x2019;s side, and first fed him healing medicine, then worriedly asked, &#x201C;Junior Wuqing, how are you? Look, I&#x2019;ve gotten the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Accepting the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus from Chun Wu&#x2019;s hands, Chu Feng shook his head, then said with a light smile, &#x201C;Senior Chun Wu, don&#x2019;t panic, I&#x2019;m fine. Go release Senior Qiu Zhu. Both of you have a portion of the Martial Markings in this place. Take them as you wish.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* Only after seeing that Chu Feng&#x2014;despite languid&#x2014;was fine did Chun Wu nod. She then came up to Qiu Zhu and the others, unraveling the Spirit Formation binding them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Wuqing, luckily we have you, otherwise today those despicable people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago would have gotten their way.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah! Junior Wuqing, I didn&#x2019;t expect you to be that powerful! You truly obtained great things in this Temple of Reproduction.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh, &#x2018;Great favours are not repaid in words of thanks&#x2019;. Junior Wuqing, we four sisters have remembered what you&#x2019;ve done today. In the future, we will definitely pay you back.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After escaping the binding, Xia Yu and Dong Xue changed their previous sinister faces and expressed their gratitude at Chu Feng with faces full of smile. Their appearances were called benignant and close, shameless and not caring about face. It was as though they had completely forgotten how they treated Chu Feng before.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, as they were speaking, they smiled pleasantly, then rose into the air and flew deeper into the Temple of Reproduction. They wanted to capture the Martial Markings flittering about deep in as well as the various Natural Oddities.</span></p><p><span style="">However, just at that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s face turned cold and he loudly yelled, &#x201C;If you wish to die, then go and take one!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
