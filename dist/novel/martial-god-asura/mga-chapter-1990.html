<p><strong> Chapter 1990 - Wang Qiang Displaying His Might</strong></p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D;</p><p>After continuing to look at Chu Feng, Luan Jie was stupefied. Although the spirit formation that Chu Feng was setting up was completely different from the one which the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had taught him, the profoundness of Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation, as well as how powerful it was, were both superior to the one that the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had taught him.</p><p>Astonished, Luan Jie muttered, &#x201C;Is it really true that he just learned how to set up that spirit formation?&#x201D;</p><p>The reason for that was because he could not believe that someone would be able to set up such a powerful spirit formation right after hearing about the method to do so. This was simply an impossibility.</p><p>It was not only Luan Jie who was this astonished. The Weaponry Refinement Immortal, a fellow Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, also revealed a grave expression. His aged eyes were flickering nonstop. The reason for that was because even he was unable to grasp such a powerful spirit formation in such a short period of time.</p><p>At the moment when Luan Jie and the others were astonished, Chu Feng had finished setting up that spirit formation. Furthermore, the spirit formation had assimilated into the Moon Demon&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;Roarrr~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the already weakened Moon Demon emitted a roar in even greater pain than before. In the same moment in which she roared, her body started to assimilate into that spirit formation.</p><p>In the end, after the sky had grown peaceful once again, the Moon Demon and the eight Stellar Keys had all disappeared. They had all entered that bowl-sized spirit formation.</p><p>Even though the Moon Demon had been successfully subdued, Chu Feng did not stop at that. Instead, he did as the Moon Immortal had instructed, and split the Moon Demon&#x2019;s sealed power into two. Then, he sent those two halves of its power to the Fire Pearl and Ice Pearl.</p><p>Such a spirit formation was very easy to make for a world spiritist like Chu Feng.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was worried that the Fire and Ice Pearl would go out of control again. Thus, he was very cautious when he instilled the Moon Demon&#x2019;s power into them. Fortunately, neither the Fire nor the Ice Pearl had any abnormal reactions. Likely, the Moon Immortal was controlling the Fire and Ice Pearls.</p><p>In the end, Chu Feng successfully instilled the power of the Moon Demon into the Fire and Ice Pearls.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The very next moment after Chu Feng succeeded, Su Rou and Su Mei&#x2019;s expressions abruptly changed.</p><p>Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately became nervous, and asked, &#x201C;Lil Rou, Lil Mei, are you two okay?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re fine. We were just a bit dizzy. Apart from that, we&#x2019;re completely fine,&#x201D; Su Mei said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t worry about it. The Moon Immortal said that she is currently absorbing the strength of the Moon Demon so that she can have the Moon Demon disappear completely. Then, she will keep her promise and hand the complete ownership of the Fire and Ice Pearls to the two of us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, during that period of time, we will have to sleep for some time. When we wake up, everything will be done,&#x201D; Su Rou said.</p><p>&#x201C;You two are really fine?&#x201D; Chu Feng was still worried. After all, this was no small matter. He had instilled the extremely dangerous Moon Demon into his lovers&#x2019; bodies.</p><p>Even though the Moon Immortal was contained within their bodies, it remained that the Moon Demon was an incomparably frightening existence.</p><p>&#x201C;We are really fine. Don&#x2019;t worry about us,&#x201D; Su Rou narrowed her eyes. Then, she used her fair-skinned hand to gently caress Chu Feng&#x2019;s face. Her movement was extremely gentle. As for Su Mei, she was smiling sweetly at the side.</p><p>Sensing Su Rou&#x2019;s warm and soft hand, as well as Su Mei&#x2019;s brilliant smile, Chu Feng felt much more at ease.</p><p>Sure enough, not long afterward, Su Rou and Su Mei lost consciousness. They had entered a coma-like state.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s return,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; The Elf Protector and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal were filled with confidence.</p><p>The Moon Demon had fallen into their hands, and Luan Jie had lost his ability to battle. When the three of them returned to the battlefield again, the Dark Hall would likely be powerless to reverse the situation. This battle was destined to be the Dark Hall&#x2019;s loss.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, rumbles were sounding from that battlefield nonstop. The energy ripples from the many ferocious martial skills were devastating the entire region. Each and every one of those martial skills was capable of causing enormous destruction.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng had left, a figure had caused the crowd to be taken greatly aback.</p><p>That person was Wang Qiang.</p><p>Every since Wang Qiang appeared, he had declared himself to be Emperor Chi&#x2019;s successor.</p><p>The crowd had all rolled their eyes at him and insulted him for being shameless. However now, he had finally revealed his strength to them.</p><p>It turned out that he was not only a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, but also a rank six Martial Emperor.</p><p>Although Chu Feng was capable of killing rank six Martial Emperors through the use of his various abilities, his actual cultivation was only that of a rank two Martial Emperor.</p><p>However, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s cultivation of rank six Martial Emperor was his actual cultivation. Inevitably, the crowd were astonished by his strength.</p><p>&#x201C;Wayayaya, a b-b-b-bunch of l-l-l-little trash, w-w-w-watch as your gr-gr-gr-granddaddy ta-ta-takes care of you all,&#x201D; Wang Qiang brandished the weapon in his hand and attacked nonstop. His every blade strike was incomparably ruthless.</p><p>&#x201C;Never would I have imagined that Wang Qiang was this powerful. If Chu Feng is the fully deserving number one member of the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism, then this Wang Qiang is definitely the fully deserving number two member of the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s younger generation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;My, that is truly the case. Not only is he a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, his martial cultivation is actually also so powerful. Although his battle power is not as frighteningly heaven-defying as Chu Feng&#x2019;s, it remains that he is an actual rank six Martial Emperor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For me to have insulted him earlier, I have truly failed to recognize Mount Tai.&#x201D;</p><p>When Wang Qiang revealed himself to be a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist earlier, many people had a whole new level of respect for Wang Qiang.</p><p>And now, the crowd&#x2019;s treatment of Wang Qiang had changed completely. Even though the person that they admired the most in their hearts was still Chu Feng, Wang Qiang had become the member of the younger generation with the highest standing in their hearts besides Chu Feng.</p><p>Merely, they did not know that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; Little Princess Xian Miaomiao possessed a heaven-defying battle power on par with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, since he&#x2019;s Emperor Chi&#x2019;s successor, why is his weapon a cleaver?&#x201D; [1. Technically, it is a chinese chef knife. Same appearance as a cleaver, just much thinner. The most versatile cooking utensil for chinese people.]</p><p>Although their hearts were filled with admiration for Wang Qiang, there were also people that were confused. The reason for that was because Wang Qiang&#x2019;s weapon was truly too strange. It was a rusty cleaver.</p><p>That&#x2019;s right, the shape of Wang Qiang&#x2019;s weapon was precisely that of a kitchen cleaver, the sort of thing that people used for cooking.</p><p>However, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s cleaver was most definitely no ordinary cleaver. It emitted a very intense Emperor&#x2019;s might. That cleaver was an actual Imperial Armament.</p><p>Merely, who was Emperor Chi? He was the first person to become an Overlord after the Ancient Era.</p><p>Even though the person publicly recognized to be the strongest among the Five Emperors, the five overlords, was Emperor Qing, in terms of seniority, Emperor Chi would be the true head of the Five Emperors.</p><p>How could such a powerful existence use a cleaver as his Imperial Armament?</p><p>&#x201C;But, exactly what sort of weapon did Emperor Chi use?&#x201D; Someone asked.</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D; The crowd were unable to answer that question. The era where Emperor Chi existed was truly too distant. There were a lot of legends regarding him. However, no one was able to determine whether they were true or false.</p><p>Even his legendary Imperial Armament possessed several tens of different appearances according to the different sorts of legends. Thus, no one was able to determine exactly what sort of Imperial Armament Emperor Chi used.</p><p>As such, no one could declare that Emperor Chi&#x2019;s Imperial Armament was not a cleaver.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
