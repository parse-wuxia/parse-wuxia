<p><strong> Chapter 2299 - Leaving None Alive</strong></p><p>When it was discovered that the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master seemed to have ill intentions toward Chu Feng, those that were cured by Chu Feng revealed extremely astonished expressions.</p><p>This was especially true for that Head Law Enforcement Elder, who possessed the same level of cultivation as the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master; he revealed fury.</p><p>However, faced with such a situation, the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master was extremely calm. He said, &#x201C;You all have been ill the entire time. Thus, you all do not know about a piece of news.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That Chu Feng has killed Ying Liangchen. Who is Ying Liangchen? He is the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s most beloved son.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, the Ying Heavenly Clan has already sent out a wanted order. They are planning to kill that Chu Feng with no regard for anything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If anyone is capable of presenting that Chu Feng&#x2019;s head to them, they will be rewarded heavily.&#x201D;</p><p>Upon hearing the words spoken by the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master, the expressions of the crowd changed once again. Even that Head Law Enforcement Elder&#x2019;s gaze turned strange.</p><p>&#x201C;That child possesses extraordinary power, and is capable of fighting against that demonic woman. I fear that I will not be able to handle him alone. Elders, are you all willing to help me capture him?&#x201D; The Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master continued.</p><p>Upon hearing those words, the elders led by the Head Law Enforcement Elder revealed even more complicated expressions.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that you all are truly planning to repay your benefactor with ill?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, that Head Law Enforcement Elder flipped his palm. Then, an Incomplete Ancestral Armament appeared in his hand.</p><p>Merely, that Incomplete Ancestral Armament was not aimed at the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master. Instead, it was aimed at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I am truly sorry, but the benefits toward our sect surpass everything. Please excuse my offense,&#x201D; The Head Law Enforcement Elder said.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately after him, all of the elders that were cured by Chu Feng unleashed their Incomplete Ancestral Armaments, all aimed at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, Chu Feng, your intention to sow dissension is useless against our Court Cloud Sect,&#x201D; At that moment, the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master laughed complacently. He seemed to have already anticipated that such a thing would happen.</p><p>&#x201C;You all are surely jackals of the same tribe. Very well,&#x201D; Chu Feng had not expected this result. He had not anticipated that the people he had saved would immediately aim their weapons at him after finding out that they would gain enormously from killing him.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization that this Court Cloud Sect was not only a sect that possessed a Sect Master that was an expert at acting, their elders were also expert actors.</p><p>When it didn&#x2019;t concern their interests, they would appear to be affectionate and true. It was as if they would definitely show absolute sincerity the moment something happened.</p><p>However, when something really did happen, when they were faced with their personal interests, they would immediately expose their true selves. For their own benefit, they were willing to abandon camaraderie. They were a bunch of heartless vile characters, a bunch of hypocrites.</p><p>Chu Feng felt hatred. His hatred was not only aimed toward these people, it was also aimed at himself.</p><p>He had always been someone with very strong perception. However, this time around, he had misjudged.</p><p>However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng did not reveal the slightest bit of panic.</p><p>Furthermore, his lips were raised into a mocking smile. He said, &#x201C;Did you all really think that you would be able to handle me?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s smile caused not only those elders, but even the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master&#x2019;s body, to shiver. A trace of fear appeared in their eyes.</p><p>No matter what, Chu Feng was someone who was able to fight against that demonic woman. They knew very well how powerful that demonic woman was.</p><p>Thus, even though the Chu Feng who stood before them was merely a young man, he was actually an existence as frightening as that demonic woman.</p><p>Chu Feng was able to see through their cowardice. Thus, he continued on with his attack. He turned around and shouted with overwhelming anger, &#x201C;All of you, move aside immediately. Else, do not blame me for unleashing a massacre!&#x201D;</p><p>Once Chu Feng&#x2019;s angry shout was heard, the bodies of those guarding the gate all trembled in fear. Then, they actually powerlessly fell on their butts.</p><p>In that sort of situation, no one dared to stop Chu Feng. One by one, they hurriedly moved away. Soon, a path was made for Chu Feng.</p><p>They were truly scared. Although their acting ability was superb, Chu Feng&#x2019;s acting ability was even better. At the very least, Chu Feng&#x2019;s acting right now was utterly perfect.</p><p>It was as if he was truly still capable of increasing his cultivation from rank four Half Martial Ancestor to rank five Martial Ancestor again.</p><p>It was as if he would truly be able to massacre all of them, leaving none alive, should he wish to do so.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng laughed again. Then, he walked slowly toward the outside of the palace hall. However, no one dared to block him.</p><p>Of course, Chu Feng had to appear to be calm. He could not fly away immediately. He could not express any intention to leave that place immediately.</p><p>Else, he would undoubtedly be killed if any one of the people present decided to attack him. After all&#x2026; Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation was truly only that of a rank four Half Martial Ancestor right now.</p><p>Even if Chu Feng were to utilize all of his abilities, he would only be able to contend against ordinary rank nine Half Martial Ancestors. He was still unable to match against Martial Ancestors, much less the two rank five Martial Ancestors present.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it is true that our Court Cloud Sect will not be able to stop you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, since I have dared to reveal myself, that means that I have one hundred percent certainty in being able to detain you here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, no matter what you try, you will definitely not be able to escape from here!&#x201D; The Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master declared loudly.</p><p>Immediately after he finished saying that, he shouted respectfully, &#x201C;Please reveal yourself and help us take care of that child!!!&#x201D;</p><p>After the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master said those words, a figure suddenly appeared. That person stood before the entrance to the palace, blocking Chu Feng&#x2019;s way out.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s you?&#x201D; Chu Feng started to frown upon seeing that person. The reason for that was because this person was none other than that demonic woman.</p><p>&#x201C;Tsk, tsk, tsk. Chu Feng, you must have never expected that we would meet again so soon, right?&#x201D; That demonic woman looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.</p><p>Merely, her gaze caused Chu Feng to feel extremely unwell. He felt as if he was a lamb in a tiger&#x2019;s den.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha. Chu Feng, do you now know why I said that I would definitely be able to make you stay?&#x201D; After that demonic woman appeared, the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master burst into a loud and complacent laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;You all actually decided to collaborate with this demonic woman for the sake of taking care of me? Or could it be that you all were accomplices of this demonic woman to begin with?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re right. We have joined hands with that demonic woman for the sake of taking care of you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, that is already not important. What is important is that you will definitely be killed,&#x201D; After the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master said those words, he turned to the demonic woman and said, &#x201C;Please go ahead and take care of that Chu Feng. I will definitely be able to obtain what you want for you.&#x201D;</p><p>That Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master was extremely respectful toward the demonic woman. In fact, he even appeared to give off a trace of submissiveness. [1. He referred to that demonic woman as &#x2018;nin&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;ni.&#x2019; &#x2018;Ni&#x2019; is chinese for &#x2018;you&#x2019;, whereas &#x2018;nin&#x2019; means &#x2018;you&#x2019; in a very respectful manner. &#x60A8; is basically a compound character composed of &#x4F60; &#x2018;you&#x2019; and &#x5FC3; &#x2018;heart.&#x2019;]</p><p>At that moment, the demonic woman smiled lightly. She turned around, looked to the outside of the palace and said, &#x201C;Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s disciples, have you all managed to see the true identity of the Sect Master and management elders that you all revere? What sort of feeling do you all have right now?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn?&#x201D; Once the demonic woman said those words, the expressions of the people from the Court Cloud Sect all changed.</p><p>&#x201C;That is?&#x201D; Chu Feng noticed that something was amiss. He discovered that there was a spirit formation in the direction the demonic woman was speaking in.</p><p>Although Chu Feng had a calm appearance, his heart was actually in chaos. That was the reason why he only noticed that spirit formation at that moment.</p><p>As for that spirit formation, it should have been set up by that demonic woman. The reason for that was because it was a spirit formation that only an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist could set up.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, the demonic woman waved her sleeve. Then, the space before her shattered like a mirror.</p><p>Sure enough, it was as Chu Feng had discovered, there was indeed a spirit formation there. Furthermore, it was a very powerful concealing formation.</p><p>After that spirit formation shattered, over ten thousand silhouettes appeared in a densely packed manner. They were all disciples of the Court Cloud Sect.</p><p>At that moment, those disciples all had astonished expressions. Evidently&#x2026; they had seen what happened in the palace hall. Merely, they did not dare to believe what had happened.</p><p>After all, in the eyes of the Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s disciples, their Sect Master and management elders were people who held righteousness above everything else, people with affectionate and true characters. In their hearts, they were sacred and inviolable.</p><p>That was why this truth was so difficult for them to accept.</p><p>&#x201C;Demonic woman, what are you doing?!&#x201D;</p><p>The Court Cloud Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master had an expression of anger. He was extremely furious.</p><p>It was not only because his disciples had found out about his actions. Most importantly, it meant that the matter would most likely be inconcealable. If news of what had happened here today were to spread, his reputation would be completely ruined.</p><p>&#x201C;What am I doing? You will soon find out.&#x201D;</p><p>The demonic woman&#x2019;s lips lifted slightly into a strange yet sinister smile. Then, a world spirit gate appeared before her.</p><p>Following that, a world spirit walked out from the world spirit gate.</p><p>It was the same Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirit that Chu Feng had encountered that day.</p><p>Although that world spirit only possessed the cultivation of a rank three Martial Ancestor, it possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Its actual battle power was on par with ordinary rank six Martial Ancestors. It was extremely strong.</p><p>Thus, when that world spirit appeared, many of the people in the Court Cloud Sect revealed frightened expressions. It was not the first time that they had seen that world spirit. As such, they firmly remembered how powerful that world spirit was.</p><p>At the very least, none of them were capable of defeating that world spirit. At the moment when their hearts were suspended with fear, a word from that demonic woman caused their hearts to sink completely.</p><p>&#x201C;Massacre them. Leave none alive,&#x201D; The demonic woman said indifferently.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
