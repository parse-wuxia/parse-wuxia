<p><strong> Chapter 2352 - Testing One&#x2019;s Heart</strong></p><p>In addition to being extremely talented, Grandmaster Kai Hong was actually also a very fortunate individual. That was the reason why he had managed to reach such grand accomplishments in his lifetime.</p><p>He had encountered countless opportunities, and obtained inheritances from many of his expert seniors. Those were crucial in how Grandmaster Kai Hong managed to obtain his position and status later on.</p><p>And now, Grandmaster Kai Hong had split all of the world spirit techniques he had learned in his lifetime, as well as his experience, into three parts, and imparted them to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. As such, this was naturally an enormous profit for Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>While Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were respectfully kneeling and bowing to Grandmaster Kai Hong, Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s body started to suddenly change. His body started to disintegrate, and turned into many firefly-like bodies of light. Then, the bodies of light fused together and turned into a coffin.</p><p>It was a very ordinary coffin. Thus, using simple abilities, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were able to tell that there was a skeleton lying in the coffin.</p><p>The skeleton was completely undamaged and flickering with light. It was a treasure. After all, that was Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remains, the remains of a Martial Immortal-level expert.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow! The source energy is intact. Chu Feng, if I am to refine the source energy, my cultivation will definitely improve a lot,&#x201D; Seeing Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remains, Her Lady Queen started to gulp down her saliva in a gluttonous manner. Her appearance was truly adorable.</p><p>&#x201C;Milady Queen, I fear that I cannot allow you to devour Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s source energy. Else, I would be an unrighteous and unjust individual,&#x201D; Chu Feng quietly said to Her Lady Queen.</p><p>&#x201C;I know. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m only saying it. After all, it would not only be you who would refuse to allow me to absorb the source energy, even that Zhao Hong and that stutterer will likely not allow me to absorb the source energy either. If you forcibly allow me to absorb that Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s source energy, you will likely end up being looked down upon by the two of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although this Queen wants to quickly increase her cultivation, I do not want you to be looked down upon by your friends,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;My Eggy is truly sensible,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Tsk~~~&#x201D; Her Lady Queen curled her lips. Then, she closed her eyes. It appeared as if she did not dare to look at Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remains again.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, Grandmaster Kai Hong has split the world spirit techniques he has learned in his lifetime into three. I think that the world spirit techniques the three of us obtained should all be different,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;W-wouldn&#x2019;t w-we know w-whether or not t-they are the same if w-we compare them?&#x201D; As Wang Qiang spoke, he outlined a spirit formation diagram in the sky.</p><p>What he outlined was a slaughtering formation with impressive might.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have that spirit formation,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Neither do I,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, do the two of you have this spirit formation?&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he also outlined the diagram of a spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;No,&#x201D; Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong shook their heads.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, it would appear that Grandmaster Kai Hong has truly split the spirit formations he learned in his lifetime into three, and imparted them respectively to the three of us. Thus, we have likely all grasped different spirit formations,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;T-that old man i-is truly unkind,&#x201D; Wang Qiang curled his lips.</p><p>Both Chu Feng and Zhao Hong understood Wang Qiang&#x2019;s intention.</p><p>People all possessed selfish hearts. This was especially true for precious items; they would all be unwilling to share them with others.</p><p>To world spiritists, Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance was extremely precious. It was something more precious than their own lives.</p><p>If the three people standing here were not Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, but rather three selfish individuals, those three people would definitely not share the spirit formations that they had obtained from Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance with one another.</p><p>In other words, Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance would not be able to be passed on in a complete manner.</p><p>However, it was evident that Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were not selfish individuals. Thus, as long as the three of them shared with one another the spirit formations that they&#x2019;d obtained, they would all be able to obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s complete inheritance.</p><p>&#x201C;This could be considered a trial too. It is a trial that is most difficult for others, a trial of one&#x2019;s heart.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, to the three of us, this trial isn&apos;t an issue at all,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>She was very confident when she said those words. Not only was she confident in herself, she also trusted Chu Feng and Wang Qiang. When she said those words, she believed that both Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were willing to share the spirit formations that they had obtained with her.</p><p>&#x201C;W-wife, i-in that case, y-you&#x2019;re saying that you&#x2019;re willing t-to share the spirit f-formations that you&#x2019;ve obtained?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked with a mischievous laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Husband, are you willing?&#x201D; Zhao Hong asked with a mischievous smile on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Of c-course I am,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said while patting his chest.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what about you?&#x201D; Zhao Hong turned to ask Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng did not answer. Instead, he chuckled lightly. Then, his arms began to move as he began to draw outlines in the sky.</p><p>With an exquisite technique, Chu Feng began to outline one exquisite spirit formation diagram after another. In merely an instant, CHu Feng had managed to outline several tens of spirit formation diagrams.</p><p>Chu Feng did not answer Zhao Hong with words. Rather, he answered her with his actions.</p><p>Zhao Hong&#x2019;s expression changed upon seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s action. It could be seen that she felt great admiration for Chu Feng&#x2019;s action.</p><p>Then, she said to Wang Qiang, &#x201C;Husband, it&#x2019;s your turn.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;W-wife, l-ladies first,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with a mischievous laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Husband, in terms of being grand, this brother of yours is much better than you,&#x201D; Zhao Hong mocked Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;No. I am n-not lacking g-grandness. R-rather, I am showing etiquette. Wife, please go ahead,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with a shameless expression. As a thick-skinned and shameless individual, how could Wang Qiang be swayed by Zhao Hong&#x2019;s mockery?</p><p>&#x201C;I am going to share Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance without holding back anything. If you dare to not share yours, I will tear you apart alive,&#x201D; Zhao Hong ruthlessly threatened Wang Qiang. Then, like Chu Feng, she began to outline the spirit formation diagrams in this vast palace hall.</p><p>After Zhao Hong began to outline her spirit formation diagrams, Wang Qiang also started to outline his spirit formation diagrams to share with Chu Feng and Zhao Hong.</p><p>Actually, the spirit formations Grandmaster Kai Hong had left behind were all extremely exquisite. For ordinary people, they would be very difficult to learn.</p><p>However, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were all people who had obtained Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance. Thus, as long as the others were willing to share, they would be able to learn them easily.</p><p>Thus, after the three of them all shared their spirit formations without holding back, the three of them all managed to obtain the complete inheritance of Grandmaster Kai Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, t-this is g-great. A-although there are a lot of spirit formations that we a-are s-still unable to set up, we a-at least know how to set them up now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Likely, t-there will n-no longer be anyone in t-the Hundred Refinements Ordinary R-Realm th-that would match up to us in t-terms of world spirit techniques,&#x201D; Wang Qiang had a very happy expression.</p><p>The reason for that was because Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s complete inheritance could truly be considered to be universally shocking. This was especially true for the slaughtering formations and defensive formations -- they were all exceptionally powerful. When used in actual battle, they would reveal overwhelming might.</p><p>It was no wonder Grandmaster Kai Hong was able to be undefeated for so long using only world spirit techniques to battle.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. Since we&#x2019;ve already obtained the inheritance, there is no need for us to stay here anymore,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait a moment,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s there to wait for?&#x201D; Zhao Hong asked.</p><p>&#x201C;The people outside, although they are all from open and upright schools, clans and sects, are not good individuals. Perhaps they might not care enormously for Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance. However, for the so-called treasures, they will definitely be filled with expectations.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The fact that they have not managed to reach this place means that they will definitely think that the three of us have obtained an enormous amount of treasure. Likely, they will not let us leave so easily,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;So what? The strongest among them are only peak Martial Ancestors. We possess the protection of the crystal giants. How could we possibly fear them?&#x201D; Zhao Hong said in a disapproving manner.</p><p>&#x201C;While the crystal giants are powerful, it remains that they are formed with spirit formations. As for those people outside, they are all old monsters that have trained for at least ten thousand years or even several tens of thousands of years. I fear that the battle experience that they have are not things that the crystal giants could compare to.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, did you not notice that after we obtained Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance, after Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s image returned to his coffin, our crystal giants are growing weaker, and that even our cloaks are changing?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Now that you mention it, that is indeed happening. What are we to do?&#x201D; Both Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were startled upon hearing what Chu Feng said.</p><p>They discovered that their crystal giants were indeed weakening, and that their cloaks that had allowed them to avoid the various traps and mechanisms were also changing.</p><p>If this were to continue, both the crystal giants and the cloaks would end up having the same result. That is, they would disappear.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
