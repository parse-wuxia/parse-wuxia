<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1145 - Visual Confrontation</strong></p><p>At this moment, a layer of cold sweat appeared on the crooked-nosed elder&#x2019;s forehead. From this, one could tell that he was truly being pressured by Long Chenyi. Especially after watching the position taken by Long Chenyi, it was clear that he came to protect Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen. From this, he knew that he had most definitely kicked an iron plate. Even if he was put into an awkward situation, he now had no choice but to accept it.</p><p>However, even though he knew that he would have to return in defeat, he was still unwilling to lose out on his airs of an elder. Thus, he forcibly calmed himself and said. &#x201C;The rules of the Cyanwood Mountain cannot be thrown into chaos. However, since, Long Chenyi, you are one of the future hopes of our Cyanwood Mountain, and have pleaded for this new disciple, I will also not bicker with him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain must definitely know about the rules. Since you know him, you should give him some guidance on behalf of this old one.&#x201D; After he finished saying those words, the elder immediately flew into the sky and hastily left the plaza.</p><p>After the elder left, the surrounding disciples that were watching what was happening all breathed in a mouthful of cold air. Even though they already knew of how powerful the Ascension Division was, when they saw it with their own eyes, they were still unable to hold in their gasps of amazement.</p><p>They were all awed by the strength of the Ascension Division and how powerful Long Chenyi was.</p><p>&#x201C;Truly annoying. It&#x2019;s always you with all these troubles; in the end, we have to come and get you out of the situation.&#x201D; Long Chenfu looked coldly at Chu Feng. His eyes were filled with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;Ha, did I ask for your help?&#x201D; Chu Feng sneered. He had completely not placed Long Chenfu in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;You basta&#x2026;&#x201D; Being talked back to in such a manner, Long Chenfu became enraged. He raised his hand and planned to attack Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop.&#x201D; Before he could do anything, Long Chenyi suddenly shouted at him, stopping all further actions from him.</p><p>&#x201C;You must be brother Chu Feng, right? I am Long Chenyi, the head of the Ascension Division. I have heard of the misunderstanding that has occurred between you and my younger brother.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, as the Ascension Sect has already entered into an alliance with the Southern Cyanwood Forest, we are, in essence, of the same family. I hope that it will be possible for us to turn hostility into friendship, and interact with one another peacefully from now on.&#x201D; With a smile on his face, Long Chenyi courteously cupped his fist toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;So it was actually senior brother Long Chenyi. It is a pleasure to meet you.&#x201D; Seeing how courteous Long Chenyi was, Chu Feng also courteously responded back with cupping his fist. However, Chu Feng was no fool. He was able to tell that Long Chenyi did not do all of that with sincerity. Not only did this man before him possess powerful strength, his wisdom also greatly surpassed Long Chenfu&#x2019;s. Compared to Long Chenfu, Long Chenyi was actually even more difficult to handle.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, may I know of the reason why you&#x2019;re not wearing your hat? Although it might not be much, it would, nevertheless, make for a pretext for those elders with ulterior motives to create troubles for you,&#x201D; Long Chenyi asked curiously.</p><p>Chu Feng cast his gaze over the crowd and asked, &#x201C;Senior brother Long Chenyi, and all other senior brothers, could it be that you all have not heard about the story of the green hat?&#x201D;.</p><p>&#x201C;The story of the green hat?&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd was puzzled. They turned to each other, looked to one another, and then shook their heads.</p><p>&#x201C;I see, so that&#x2019;s why. However, there would be no harm for me to tell you all about it.&#x201D; Seeing this, Chu Feng smiled mischievously. Then, without leaving out any details, and even adding some more vivid details himself, Chu Feng began to narrate the story of the green hat that Eggy had told him to the crowd of the Ascension Division.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s such a story?&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing the story of the green hat, the females present were still fine. However, as for the males, all of their expressions changed.</p><p>That was because Chu Feng&#x2019;s ability to tell a story was even more powerful than Eggy&#x2019;s. If Eggy&#x2019;s story of the green hat was still only that of a story, then the story that Chu Feng narrated to them was akin to the truth.</p><p>Thus, at this very moment, the more the males looked at the green hats on their heads, the more uncomfortable they felt. Especially when they thought of how many years they had worn the green hat on their heads, they began to felt as if they have eaten rotten eggplants; it was an extremely uncomfortable sensation.</p><p>&#x201C;Sigh, although this is merely a story, I still felt uncomfortable because of it. In order to make myself a bit more comfortable, I decided to not wear the hat.&#x201D; As he looked at the expressions of the males, that appeared as if they had eaten dog shit, Chu Feng pretended to sigh with sorrow. As he said those words, he even touched his hair and said. &#x201C;I feel that it is more comfortable this way.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the crowd was silent. As for the male members of the Ascension Division, they began to quietly put the green hats in their hands away, and secretly crush them to pieces.</p><p>Even the other bystanders that had heard the story hurried to remove their green hats. There were some that were unable to contain themselves and cursed out loud. &#x201C;Who the f*ck designed this hat? I curse him so that his wife will find another man!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng is truly witty. However, it is true that this story affects one&#x2019;s frame of mind. It&#x2019;s merely a hat, it is fine to not wear it.&#x201D; In fact, even Long Chenyi put the hat in his hand away. He then turned to Bai Ruochen and said. &#x201C;Junior sister Ruochen&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you wish to persuade me to go to the Ascension Division, you can save yourself the effort.&#x201D; Before Long Chenyi could finish what he wanted to say, Bai Ruochen interrupted with these words.</p><p>At this moment, including Long Chenyi who was planning to persuade Bai Ruochen, everyone else from the Ascension Division opened their mouths wide in shock. Even Chu Feng was shocked by her actions.</p><p>In his heart, he thought to himself &#x2018;This girl is truly too ruthless. She spoke to Long Chenyi in such a manner before such a huge crowd. This is clearly putting Long Chenyi in an awkward situation.&#x2019;</p><p>However, Long Chenyi had clearly come prepared. He only hesitated for a split second before once again displaying a smile and saying, &#x201C;Junior sister Ruochen, even if you do not wish to hear it, I will still finish what I wanted to say.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let me speak of it like this. The Ascension Division is not something that I, Long Chenyi, owns. Instead, it is a part of the Ascension Sect. As junior sister Ruochen is also someone from the Ascension Sect, you are inevitably linked to the Ascension Division.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I hope that junior sister Ruochen is able to disregard former grievances, forgive the wrongdoings of our Ascension Division, and return to us. After all, this is your home. As long as you&#x2019;re willing to return, I am able to agree to all conditions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior brother Long, I appreciate your kindness. However, you truly do not have to bother wasting time on this matter anymore, as it will only serve as a detriment our relationship.&#x201D; Bai Ruochen refused in a very determined manner. Her calm and ice-cold tone seemed to say that she showed no consideration for this matter at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior sister Ruochen, are you truly unable to consider it once more?&#x201D; Long Chenyi was unwilling to give up.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey hey hey, senior brother Long Chenyi, this should be enough, no? You must know that Lil Sis Ruochen is a member of my Asura Division now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re trying to take a member of my branch power organization right in front of my face, isn&#x2019;t this a bit too not putting me, Chu Feng, in your eyes?&#x201D; At this moment, Chu Feng was finally unable to continue watching.</p><p>&#x201C;Who the f*ck do you think you are? You think you&#x2019;re worthy enough for my big brother to look at you?&#x201D; Before Long Chenyi could respond, Long Chenfu pointed at Chu Feng&#x2019;s head and cursed.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s face immediately turned icy-cold. Like sharp blades, he looked to Long Chenfu and coldly said, &#x201C;Who do I think I am? Do you believe that I will massacre your entire family?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze and hearing those words, Long Chenfu&#x2019;s expression immediately changed. The threatening behavior that he displayed earlier was gone in a flash as a indescribable sense of fear filled his body.</p><p>Even he himself did not know why he was feeling this sort of sensation. However, at this very moment, he was truly afraid. Furthermore, he was so afraid that he did not dare to look Chu Feng in the face anymore. He hurriedly lowered his head and retreated.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, your anger is quite intense.&#x201D; Right at this moment, Long Chenyi suddenly stood in front of Long Chenfu. Furthermore, with his brows tensed and his eyes shining, he was actually meeting Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze, that was filled with killing intent, head-on.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
