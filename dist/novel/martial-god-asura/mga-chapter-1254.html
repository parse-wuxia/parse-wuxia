<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1254 - Beautiful Woman</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, your ability to insult others is truly extraordinary.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, as we are men, to be impressive with merely words is no talent at all.&#x201D; After containing Qi Yanyu, Bai Yunxiao spoke again.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, then according to senior brother Bai, we are only supposed to listen as that Qi Yanyu insults us, and cannot speak back?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To be honest, that sort of thing is impossible for me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since senior brother Bai says it like that, could it be that senior brother Bai is capable of ignoring another&#x2019;s insults?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If that truly is the case, then senior brother Bai, what do you think about having me insult you, so that you can broaden my horizons with your noble character and extraordinary patience?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Being spoken to by Chu Feng in such a manner, Bai Yunxiao started to firmly clench his fists as anger filled his heart.</p><p>However, he was extremely quick to calm his mental state. Before others could discover his anger, he had already forcibly suppressed it. With a sneer, he said, &#x201C;As men, one should put one&#x2019;s abilities into areas that one should focus on.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For example, today&#x2019;s dragon grade mission. Not to mention that this mission is to wipe out evils for the people, the dragon grade missions themselves are a kind of honor for the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s disciples. At the same time, it is also their duty.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Junior brother Chu Feng, you are a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. As such, you should have given your all to try to join this mission. Yet, why is it that when you discovered the difficulty of the mission, you decided to turn around to leave?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that you were afraid? Could it be that you feared that you might lose your life, and did not dare to take on this heavy responsibility?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Huuu~~~&#x201D; Once Bai Yunxiao said these words, the crowd all gasped. Everyone shifted their gazes to Chu Feng. As for their gazes, they contained, to a greater or lesser extent, contempt for Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Look at his terrified appearance, he is most definitely scared. Else, why would he be running away?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sure enough, he&#x2019;s trash. Not only is he trash, he&#x2019;s also a selfish coward,&#x201D; Seeing this, Zhao Jingang and the others also joined in the humiliation of Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Who said we&#x2019;re scared?&#x201D; At this moment, Bai Ruochen was unable to contain herself and shouted in refute.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? So you&#x2019;re not scared. In that case, come and participate in the examination. However, with the &#x2018;all show and no go&#x2019; abilities that the two of you possess, I doubt you&#x2019;ll be able to obtain the qualifications to go on this dragon grade mission. However, if you are to participate in the examination, it would at least show that you have some courage,&#x201D; Bai Yunxiao said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Fine, we&#x2019;ll partici-&#x201D; Being provoked by Bai Yunxiao, Bai Ruochen was about to agree.</p><p>&#x201C;Ruochen, don&#x2019;t be impulsive,&#x201D; However, before Bai Ruochen could finish her words, Chu Feng hurriedly stopped her.</p><p>At the same time, he sent her a voice transmission, &#x201C;He is provoking you to do it. It is beyond clear. His intentions are precisely to lure us into participating in this mission. If we are to agree to it, it is very likely that we&#x2019;ll fall into a trap.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I fear that what would be waiting for us then would not only be Monstrous Dragon Beasts, there would also be people who would want to kill us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Keh, with how they&#x2019;re provoking us, what should we do then? If we are to not agree to it, then wouldn&#x2019;t we become the laughingstock of the crowd?&#x201D; As Bai Ruochen spoke, she turned her gaze to the surrounding crowd.</p><p>Sure enough, the crowd&#x2019;s gazes were firmly fixed upon Chu Feng and her. Their gazes were awfully strange, and even contained traces of ridicule.</p><p>Moreover, some people had already begun to whisper amongst themselves. As for what they were whispering about, they were naturally unpleasant things to hear.</p><p>The contents were all along the lines of insulting words like Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen being cowards, and them having misjudged them.</p><p>&#x201C;Endure, the only thing we can do now is endure,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>After hearing those words, even though Bai Ruochen was very unwilling, she ultimately ended up enduring.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, look. Didn&#x2019;t I say that they were trash? Senior brother Bai, it&#x2019;s a waste of your time to bother with people like them. They simply do not have any care for our collective honor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It can be seen merely from their previous conduct and deeds that they are selfish people with no regard for others and have never considered our Cyanwood Mountain to be their home, much less fellow disciples as relatives. They are simply unworthy of being disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain,&#x201D; Qi Yanyu began to add in more insults.</p><p>&#x201C;People with that sort of character are unworthy of being disciples.&#x201D; At this moment, even that management elder of the Punishment Department spoke.</p><p>Even though he spoke casually, it was clear that his words were aimed at Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen. After all, the intentions behind his words were very clear; he was saying that Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s characters were very bad, and that they were unworthy of continuing to be in the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>&#x201C;Sigh, earlier we&#x2019;ve thought those two to be geniuses. However, it would appear now that they&#x2019;re only trash.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I thought that Chu Feng was a hero before. However, it would appear now that he&#x2019;s a f*cking coward.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With their cultivation and strength, they should have participated in the dragon grade mission. After all, this is related to the honor of our Cyanwood Mountain. Yet, because they were scared, they did not dare to participate. They are truly two cowards.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While they can decide to not participate since this is a mission, but if the Cyanwood Mountain were to encounter a calamity in the future, how could people like them possibly stand out to fight for the Cyanwood Mountain? They would have most definitely fled far away.&#x201D;</p><p>After that management elder spoke, many disciples began to suck up to him. They no longer discussing things in soft voices and instead began to loudly insult Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.</p><p>In an instant, voices insulting Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen filled the sky above the Mission Plaza.</p><p>Their voices were extremely ear-piercing. Wave upon wave, they entered Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s ears, eroding their souls, destroying their self-esteem.</p><p>At this moment, both Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying were gnashing their teeth in anger. Their little faces were filled with expressions of anger.</p><p>Compared to them, Chu Feng&#x2019;s reaction was awfully calm. It was not that he wasn&#x2019;t angry. Instead, he had suppressed his anger.</p><p>It was not that he did not care about the insults that these people were throwing at him; on the contrary, he cared deeply. Furthermore, he was using his eyes to observe the people who were insulting him so that he could remember all of them.</p><p>In this world, there were truly many opportunists that would take advantage of a situation, and began to flatter whoever was stronger and attack the weaker side.</p><p>Chu Feng was going to remember these people so that he would make it so that these people would not have any opportunity to approach him in the future when he became powerful.</p><p>As for these people that were currently publicly insulting Chu Feng for the sake of sticking up to the Punishment Department&#x2019;s elders, Bai Yunxiao and the others were extremely pleased with themselves.</p><p>However, they did not know that they had been placed onto Chu Feng&#x2019;s blacklist, and would never be able to befriend him.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is Tao Xiangyu? Get out here!!!&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, an angry voice sounded from afar.</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, all of the people present were startled. However, the people who were the most shocked and surprised would be Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.</p><p>That was because that voice was a woman&#x2019;s. Although her words were rough and coarse, it must be admitted that her voice was extremely pleasant to hear. Most importantly, this woman&#x2019;s voice was extremely familiar to Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.</p><p>Not long after this voice sounded, several figures soon flew over from the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s entrance and arrived at the Mission Plaza.</p><p>Among them were the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s core elders. At this moment, each and every one of these elders had pale complexions; they were covered in sweat and even panting. It seemed that they were very exhausted.</p><p>Only the person leading them was still calm, composed and extraordinarily vigorous.</p><p>However, the person who led them was not someone from the Cyanwood Mountain. Not only was she not someone from the Cyanwood Mountain, she was also a beautiful and alluring woman.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
