<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 234 - Hidden Expert</strong></p><p>The Valley of Hundred Bends was a terrifying formation as its range went from the ground to the sky. As long as it was within the scope of the Valley of Hundred Bends, there would be a layer of invisible pressure that engulfed them and started to suppress humans.</p><p>That scary pressure was not blockable even if it was Chu Feng. However, in such a place, there was someone staying there. And in that instant, it was right in front of his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Hey! Is there anyone? Can you help me out?&#x201D;</p><p>The current Chu Feng was on the border of life and death, but he knew that the master of the temple must have a method to decipher the formation. After all, that person was very possibly a Blue-cloak World Spiritist. His Spirit Formation methods would certainly be incomparable by Chu Feng.</p><p>Besides, from the smoke, he could tell that there was indeed someone there, and that person was not affected by the strange pressure, or else how would he be so peaceful as to cook there?</p><p>So, Chu Feng used all his power to rush near the temple hall. At that instant, he didn&#x2019;t care who the master of the temple hall was or whether it was dangerous or not. He knew that if the master there helped him, he would have a string of chance to live. If he didn&#x2019;t help, he would undoubtedly die.</p><p>*whoosh* Just as Chu Feng was going to get near, a person jumped out from the temple hall and landed on the summit of the mountain peak.</p><p>It was an old man who had white hair and a face full of wrinkles. However, his eyes were bright and lively. The most important thing was that the old man wore a golden-coloured robe. On the chest section of that robe, there was even a Qilin. He was a person from the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion.</p><p>When the old man saw that Chu Feng could stand in air, he couldn&#x2019;t help but tightly frown and a hint&#xA0;of shock emerged onto his face. After a while, he calmed back down and indifferently asked, &#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, I am a disciple from the Azure Dragon School and I came to participate in the Heroic Hunt.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, since I was unable to leave the Valley of Hundred Bends in time, I am being restricted by strange pressure. Right now, I cannot breathe so I hope that you can save my life.&#x201D; Chu Feng went straight into the main topic because he really did not have time to speak any useless words.</p><p>&#x201C;My apologies. I am not the master here so I cannot decide. How about this. Wait a while and I&#x2019;ll go ask. As for whether he is willing to help you or not will depend on your luck.&#x201D; The old man left those words, then after assessing Chu Feng with surprise, his body leaped and he rushed back into the temple hall.</p><p>At that moment, within the temple hall, an old man with a lively face while wearing clothing that was roughly made by cloth was sitting in front of a stove. He had one leg over the other while humming a little tune as he cooked soup in high spirits. As he saw the white-haired old man return, the cloth-clothed old man very casually asked, &#x201C;Fengyang, what kind of person intruded into my territory?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A boy at the 1st level of the Profound realm.&#x201D; The white-haired old man said.</p><p>&#x201C;A boy at the 1st level of the Profound realm? Fengyang, what kind of joke is that? Clearly, that person came over while walking on air. How can he have the cultivation of the 1st level of the Profound realm? He should be in the Heaven realm.&#x201D; The cloth-clothed old man suspiciously curled his lips.</p><p>&#x201C;You knew yet you told me to go, and at the end, I told you yet you don&#x2019;t believe. You&#x2019;re a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, so wouldn&#x2019;t you know who that person is if you check?&#x201D; The white-haired old man helplessly glared at the cloth-clothed old man.</p><p>At that instant, the cloth-clothed old man already closed his eyes, and when he reopened them, a bit of shock also appeared emerged into his gaze as he said, &#x201C;Impressive. 1st level of the Profound realm and he already grasped a method to walk on air. It seems that he cultivated a special bodily martial skill and he isn&#x2019;t that old. I say, Fengyang, it seems that your Azure Province has a good seedling huh.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But sadly, he is unable to endure the pressure from this formation. I&#x2019;m afraid that his little life will be hard to be kept alive.&#x201D; The cloth-clothed old man shook his head and continued humming the little tune and cooking the meat soup on the stove.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Hengyuan, in my Azure Province, there aren&#x2019;t many martial skills that allow someone to walk on air. This person must got the inheritance of the Imperial Sky Sage. It&#x2019;s quite hard to see the Imperial Sky Sage&#x2019;s unique skill, for walking on air that disappeared for a hundred years, reappear.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I wonder if brother Hengyuan can give me face and save his life?&#x201D; The white-haired old man pleaded.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Fengyang, martial skills for walking on air are hard to get treasures in any of the Nine Provinces. However, what does that have to do with me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I hiddenly live in this place because I don&#x2019;t want anyone to disturb me. Since he discovered this area, in the future, it would be hard for him to keep this a secret and he would leak it out. Not to mention if he doesn&#x2019;t die from the formation pressure here, even if he lives, I will not let him leave alive.&#x201D; The cloth-clothed old man faintly smiled.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Hengyuan, are you truly not going to save a life?&#x201D; The white-haired old man slightly frowned.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems like you don&#x2019;t understand me enough.&#x201D; The cloth-clothed old man smiled and he was not moved.</p><p>*whoosh* At that instant, the white-haired old man did not waste any words anymore. He leaped out of the temple hall and arrived on the summit of the mountain peak once again.</p><p>As he looked at Chu Feng who stood on air, had a deathly-white face, and was going fall down at any moment, he tightly frowned as if doing a hard decision.</p><p>But at the end, he still grinded his teeth and took out a crystal-like badge from his chest pocket. He threw it towards Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Catch.&#x201D;</p><p>*bang* Seeing that, Chu Feng quickly extended his hand to receive it, and after getting the badge, the invisible pressure that circled around Chu Feng instantly disappeared. The air and Profound power that vanished before reappeared around Chu Feng.</p><p>In that instant, Chu Feng was incomparably happy because he was finally saved. He first closed his eyes and deeply breathed for a few moments. For the first time, he felt that breathing was quite a comfortable thing.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you sen...Senior, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng originally wanted to thank him, but he discovered with astonishment that the white-haired old man&#x2019;s face was a bit pale-white and it was a bit ugly. He looked just like how Chu Feng was earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;I only have one of the badges. After giving it to you, I have to bear the formation pressure here as well.&#x201D; The white-haired old man calmly smiled and said.</p><p>&#x201C;What? This..&#x201D; After hearing those words, Chu Feng was instantly greatly shocked. He never would have thought that the old man who met him for the first time and were complete strangers would sacrifice his life in order to save him.</p><p>That put Chu Feng in a difficult situation. He could see that the master of that area was not willing to save him and that the old man decided this on his own. He gave his own object of protection to Chu Feng, but from that, he himself sank into danger.</p><p>Although Chu Feng really wanted to continue living, he was not willing to let an old man who he met for the first time lose his life in order to save him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, quickly remember the formation in this badge. As long as you remember it, I can help you recreate a protection badge like this. At that time, naturally, you can hold the formation pressure off.&#x201D; Just at that time, Eggy&#x2019;s pleasing voice rang out in Chu Feng brain.</p><p>At that instant, Chu Feng suddenly realized what to do. Without hesitating, he quickly imbued his Spirit power into the crystal-like badge and he studied the formation in the badge.</p><p>After a while, he raised his head with a flash of enlightenment and he discovered that the white-haired old man&#x2019;s face was getting more and more ugly. So, he said, &#x201C;Senior, I am Chu Feng. What would your great name be? In the future, I will certainly repay this life-saving favour.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ho..Little friend, you&#x2019;re called Chu Feng? That is quite a good name.&#x201D; Qi Fengyang forced a light smile out, but he could not conceal the pain of having trouble breathing.</p><p>&#x201C;Big favours are not thanked with words. In the future, I will repay this favour with actions. Senior, I hope we will meet again.&#x201D; After saying those words, Chu Feng threw the badge in his hand back to Qi Fengyang.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you...&#x201D; At the same time that Qi Fengyang caught the badge, he discovered that Chu Feng already turned around and left. At that instant, he originally wanted to chase, but he could not as he who was not able to walk on air was powerless.</p><p>&#x201C;This boy is quite courageous. But that&#x2019;s good. If he did not give the protective badge back to you, I would have personally taken it back. It is always better for him to take the initiative to hand it back rather than me killing him.&#x201D;</p><p>Just at that time, faint laughter rang out. The lively cloth-clothed old man already appeared next to Qi Fengyan without any voice. However, he was not standing on the peak of the mountain. He was standing on air.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
