<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1288 - Boundary Energy</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What are you planning to do?&#x201D; Qin Lingyun was no fool, he was able to tell that Bai Suyan was planning to attack him from a single glance. Furthermore, he also knew that her strength was extremely powerful and that she was not someone that he could contend against.</p><p>However, even though this was the case, he still remained calm and did not fear her at all. In fact, he had an expression of confidence on his face.</p><p>He did not believe that Bai Suyan would dare to attack him before this many elders from the Cyanwood Mountain and especially not before the head of the Punishment Department, Crazed Killer Tuoba.</p><p>After all, Elder Hong Mo and the others from the Medicine Concocting Department had ended up suffering disastrous consequences after beating him up. Thus, the consequences that an outsider would receive would be even greater.</p><p>&#x201C;What I&#x2019;m planning to do? I shall let you see what I plan to do.&#x201D;</p><p>However, Bai Suyan snorted coldly upon hearing Qin Lingyun&#x2019;s question. She, who was extremely furious, had simply disregarded all the possible consequences. With one hand holding Qin Lingyun&#x2019;s collar, her other hand was slapped toward Qin Lingyun&#x2019;s cheek.</p><p>Everything happened too quickly. After a loud and resounding &#x2018;paa&#x2019; was heard, Qin Lingyun received a ruthless slap to the face.</p><p>&#x201C;You dared to hit me, you&#x2019;re truly courting dea&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Sensing a scorching pain on his cheek, Qin Lingyun began to gnash his teeth in anger. He had never ever expected that Bai Suyan would dare to actually hit him.</p><p>However, before he could finish saying what he wanted to say, Bai Suyan actually clenched her palm into a fist and struck it down onto his mouth.</p><p>This fist was extremely powerful and left behind a tragic sight. When Qin Lingyun opened his mouth, not only was blood rushing out of it, even his teeth had all been shattered.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D; Seeing that their strongest disciple was being beaten by someone, the Punishment Department&#x2019;s management elders all drew the Punishment Blades on their waists in violent rage. They planned to attack Bai Suyan.</p><p>&#x201C;All of you, stay there and do not move!&#x201D; However, right at this moment, Crazed Killer Tuoba coldly shouted at them.</p><p>After hearing those words, the Punishment Department&#x2019;s management elders, although stunned, all stopped their movements. They were truly confused.</p><p>They did not understand why Crazed Killer Tuoba would stop them from helping Qin Lingyun. One had to know that Qin Lingyun was one of Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s favorite disciples.</p><p>However, after they saw Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s appearance, as he was tightly clenching his fists and his veins were already bulging in incomparable anger, as he stood there and then saw the appearance of Half Martial Emperor White Ape standing there with a smile on his face as if he was enjoying the show, they seemed to come to a realization.</p><p>The current Punishment Department was evidently not the same as it had been before. They were no longer the strongest in the Cyanwood Mountain, and now had no choice but to live with their heads lowered. Even the arrogant and despotic Crazed Killer Tuoba could only endure silently.</p><p>However, upon closer thinking, there was nothing that could be done about this. After all, Half Martial Emperor White Ape possessed the Headmaster&#x2019;s Enforcement Title Plate.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop,&#x201D; Finally, Half Martial Emperor White Ape spoke. Although outsiders might think that he had spoken those words extremely quickly, he said &#x2018;stop&#x2019; right after Bai Suyan attacked Qin Lingyun, which meant that he actually said it rather slowly. That was because Bai Suyan was extremely powerful and managed to badly batter Qin Lingyun in an instant.</p><p>At the very least, at this moment, after Bai Suyan stopped her attack, Qin Lingyun was already covered in blood, and had lost consciousness.</p><p>At this moment, the Punishment Department&#x2019;s management elders were finally able to fly over. With fierce expressions on their faces, they snatched Qin Lingyun from Bai Suyan and began to treat his injuries.</p><p>However, apart from that, they were unable to do anything else. Knowing that Half Martial Emperor White Ape was shielding Bai Suyan, there was simply nothing that they could do.</p><p>In fact, this was precisely the case. After Bai Suyan stopped attacking Qin Lingyun, Half Martial Emperor White Ape merely spoke some words of criticism against her and did not actually try to punish her substantially.</p><p>Just like this, Qin Lingyun was violently beaten by Bai Suyan. Furthermore, he was beaten right in front of the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s numerous elders and disciples, as well as in front of outsiders.</p><p>&#x201C;Bai Suyan, this debt, we&#x2019;ll settle it eventually.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lingyun will not have been beaten for nothing, and Xionghua&#x2019;s life will not have been lost for nothing.&#x201D;</p><p>Right when Bai Suyan returned to her seat, a voice filled with grievance and anger slow entered her ears.</p><p>It was a voice transmission that only Bai Suyan managed to hear. As for the person who had sent this voice transmission, it was naturally Crazed Killer Tuoba.</p><p>Bai Suyan was able to guess who that Xionghua was. It was most likely that Punishment Department&#x2019;s management elder who had chased after them to kill them only to be killed by her instead.</p><p>For Crazed Killer Tuoba to say those words, it meant that he knew that the elder had died, and that he had died by Bai Suyan&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>As for Bai Suyan, she did not try to deny any of this. Instead, she smiled lightly and replied, &#x201C;Anytime.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing that word, the anger in Crazed Killer Tuoba&#x2019;s eyes was so enormous that it could simply kill a person alive. However, he still managed to restrain himself with great difficulty. That was because as long as Half Marital Emperor White Ape was present, he had no option but to endure.</p><p>Just like this, the dragon grade mission concluded.</p><p>However, what the people would remember would not only be this dragon grade mission, but they would also remember a name.</p><p>As for this name, it was Chu Feng. He was an exceptional genius who had managed to, using his rank five Martial King cultivation, defeat four Divine Bodies.</p><p>After this day, Chu Feng&#x2019;s famed name was destined to spread throughout the entire Cyanwood Domain. Regardless of whether they might be men or women, young or old, they would all come to know about the exceptional genius who had appeared in the Cyanwood Mountain. As for that genius, his name was Chu Feng.</p><p>After the dragon grade mission concluded, the Boundless Green Sea regained its former peacefulness. While the people from the numerous powers returned to their own territories, Chu Feng and the others went to the Cyanwood Domain&#x2019;s border.</p><p>In order to prevent accidents from happening, Half Martial Emperor White Ape also accompanied Chu Feng and the others to the Cyanwood Domain&#x2019;s border. While on the surface he had done so because he wanted to see Chu Feng and the others off, he had actually done that because he feared that Crazed Killer Tuoba and the others from the Punishment Department would attack Chu Feng&#x2019;s group from the shadows.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the Boundary Energy?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng and the others had arrived at the border. As they looked to the seven-colored rainbow-like protective screen that ran from high above the sky to deep underneath the ground, even someone as calm as Chu Feng was unable to help himself from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p><p>That was because the so-called boundary energy was truly an astonishing sight.</p><p>Looking from afar, it flickered on the horizon like an aurora. Not only was it magnificent, it was also very beautiful.</p><p>When looking from nearby, it appeared like multi-colored smoke that appeared from the earth and floated into the vast sky.</p><p>It would not harm anyone. Even if one were to approach it and touch it with one&#x2019;s hand, it would still not cause any harm. However, if one wished to pass through it, it was only possible if one had methods that were powerful enough.</p><p>This was the boundary energy.</p><p>&#x201C;No matter how many times I see this Boundary Energy, I will always be as excited and emotional as I was the first time I saw it. It is truly too beautiful,&#x201D; Sima Ying had an expression of appreciation on her face. She was very fond of the Boundary Energy&#x2019;s beauty.</p><p>&#x201C;According to legend, the Boundary Energy is man-made. Although this is only a rumor, if it is really the case, then the person who set up the Boundary Energy is most definitely exceptionally and frighteningly powerful,&#x201D; Bai Ruochen said.</p><p>There were a lot of legends about the Boundary Energy. However, to Bai Ruochen, she hoped that this beautiful Boundary Energy was something that a human expert had created.</p><p>Right at this moment, Bai Suyan spoke, &#x201C;Well then, three little fellows, there&#x2019;s a lot of time for you three to admire the Boundary Energy in the future. As for now, I will need to borrow your spirit power so that we can open a path through this Boundary Energy.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
