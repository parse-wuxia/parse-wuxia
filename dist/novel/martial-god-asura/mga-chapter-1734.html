<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1734 - Enormous Crisis</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment when the crowd were all worried, Baili Xuankong suddenly shot out a palm strike explosively. His palm strike not only pushed back all of Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s attacks, it also shattered the entire stage. One must know that this stage had been created with special materials. Thus, it contained incomparable hardness.</p><p>One could easily imagine what enormous destructive power such a powerful palm strike had brought about. Being protected by the older generation, the younger generation watching the battle began to rapidly fall back and distance themselves from the battle out of fear of being implicated.</p><p>After all, this was not a battle between people of the younger generation. Instead, it was a battle between Martial Emperors. Furthermore, they were not ordinary Martial Emperors, but a pair of rank three Martial Emperors.</p><p>At this moment when the crowd were distancing themselves from the battlefield, Baili Xuankong and Nangong Beidou continued to fight.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Baili Xuankong had fought back another ferocious attack from Nangong Beidou. After pushing it back, Baili Xuankong unleashed a counterattack. As he waved one of his hands upward and streaked his other hand across his waist, a writing brush suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p>This writing brush was two feet long and black in color. Other than having the two characters &#x2018;Death&#x2019; and &#x2018;Kill,&#x2019; carved onto it, it appeared to be very ordinary.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, soon, many talismans shining with golden light began to appear on the writing brush. The talismans were so numerous that they numbered in the several thousands. As the talismans began to move, it was like a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses galloping within the writing brush. At the same time, a very enormous might swept forth from the brush and began to intimidate the surroundings.</p><p>Incomplete Imperial Armament. That writing brush was an Incomplete Imperial Armament. Being in Baili Xuankong&#x2019;s hand, that Incomplete Imperial Armament was able to unleash its supreme might. After all, Imperial Armaments were meant to be used by Martial Emperors. Only Martial Emperors were capable of bringing out the true power of Imperial Armaments.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Once the brush was unleashed, Baili Xuankong&#x2019;s battle power surged instantly. With a wave of his sleeve, Baili Xuankong actually wrote out a golden-bright and dazzling &#x2018;death,&#x2019; character in the air while facing Nangong Beidou.</p><p>After the &#x2018;death&#x2019; character appeared, it began to rapidly increase in size. Like a small mountain, it moved toward Nangong Beidou to crush him.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph.&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Beidou was already prepared for this. Even though he was moving backwards, a fiery red blade and a blue spear soon appeared in his hands.</p><p>As he brandished his two Incomplete Imperial Armaments, two blade rays shot forth. As the blade rays appeared, dragon roars could be heard. As the dragon roars sounded, the two blade rays turned into a fire and a water dragon.</p><p>The two dragons were enormous. As they interweaved with one another and moved as if dancing, water and fire filled the sky. The might behind that attack was simply heavenly.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, even though Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s attack was extremely ferocious, it was unable to contend against the &#x2018;death&#x2019; character written by Baili Xuankong using his Death Kill Brush.</p><p>The &#x2018;death&#x2019; character flickered with golden light. It was as if it were capable of killing everything before it. As it fought against the two dragons, it actually crushed both dragons to pieces.</p><p>After that, the &#x2018;death&#x2019; character suddenly shattered into countless golden lights. Like ten thousand arrows, they shot toward Nangong Beidou.</p><p>&#x201C;Pa, pa, pa~~&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that, Nangong Beidou was overwhelmed with shock. Evidently, he did not expect that his two top quality Incomplete Imperial Armaments would be inferior to his opponent&#x2019;s writing brush.</p><p>However, at this moment, he did not have the time to think about anything. He could only move the blade and spear in his hands about to resist Baili Xuankong&#x2019;s attack.</p><p>At the moment when the golden arrows gradually disappeared, a bloody wound appeared on Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s left arm. He had actually been injured.</p><p>Upon seeing that wound, everybody in the crowd was shocked. Exactly who was this mysterious expert? He was actually capable of injuring Nangong Beidou?</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that the Clan Chief of the Nangong Imperial Clan, Nangong Beidou, is not up to much,&#x201D; At this moment, Baili Xuankong said mockingly.</p><p>&#x201C;Die!&#x201D; Being injured, it would naturally be Nangong Beidou who was the most enraged right now. He felt that he had been humiliated, and thus unleashed his Imperial Bloodline. Golden light began to cover his entire body. At this moment, he had the appearance of a god.</p><p>It was as if he were no longer a human, but rather a golden god of war.</p><p>Most importantly, his battle power had also increased enormously. As he brandished his Incomplete Imperial Armaments again, a total of ten fire dragons and ten water dragons appeared with ear-piercing roars. Furthermore, each and every pair of dragons was stronger than the two before.</p><p>However, even with this being the case, Baili Xuankong still felt no fear. He brandished the writing brush in his hand again, and successively wrote twenty golden-bright and dazzling &#x2018;kill&#x2019; characters at Nangong Beidou.</p><p>These twenty &#x2018;kill&#x2019; characters were all much more powerful than the &#x2018;death&#x2019; character from before. As the &#x2018;kill&#x2019; characters set out, they completely exterminated all twenty of Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s huge dragons in an instant.</p><p>&#x201C;Is he no match for him even after using his Imperial Bloodline?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, not to mention the others, even the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were filled with incomparable shock. After all, Nangong Beidou was the pillar of their Nangong Imperial Clan. If even he was no match for that mysterious man, who among their Nangong Imperial Clan could possibly match him? [1. Well, you have 3 elders and Nangong Longjian&#x2026; but hey, I guess none of them are here.]</p><p>Seeing that the situation was bad, someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan shouted, &#x201C;Set up the Bloodline Inheritance Formation to assist Lord Clan Chief!&#x201D; Immediately afterward, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan answered his call.</p><p>They began to set up a special formation. Relying on the relationships of their bloodlines, they began to send their bloodline power to Nangong Beidou in a steady flow.</p><p>In this sort of situation, the &#x2018;Imperial&#x2019; character on Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s forehead grew brighter and brighter. The golden light that covered his body grew more and more magnificent, and his battle power also grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>However, even with this being the case, Nangong Beidou was still only able to barely fight Baili Xuankong to a tie. He was simply incapable of defeating Baili Xuankong, much less killing Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;White-brow, why are you still watching? Quickly, kill that Chu Feng!&#x201D; Sensing that the situation was bad, Nangong Beidou could only request help from the White-browed Immortal.</p><p>However, White-browed Immortal was standing there motionlessly like a fool. He was simply unable to hear Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s request. Evidently, he was still unable to accept the fact that Chu Feng was alive, and was in a state of extreme shock.</p><p>Feeling helpless, Nangong Beidou turned his gaze to the crowd outside. &#x201C;Everyone, this Chu Feng has done countless malicious deeds. He is an extremely evil person. We absolutely cannot let him leave. Else, he will definitely bring about calamity to the world.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, help me kill that Chu Feng. I will bestow great thanks to everyone who helps kill Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, the chaotic crowd burst into an uproar. Upon hearing the word &#x2018;great thanks,&#x2019; it perked the interest of many of the people present.</p><p>Even though that Chu Feng was very powerful, it remained that he was a child. Even if he were to become great in the future, it didn&#x2019;t seem like there would be any benefits to them.</p><p>However, if they were to help the Nangong Imperial Clan and kill that Chu Feng, they would be able to obtain benefits right away.</p><p>Thus, at this moment, not to mention the Martial Emperor-level experts, even the peak Half Martial Emperor-level experts were tempted to help the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Chief Nangong, words are empty, if we are to help you, how are you going to thank us? If your thanks are too small, we will not do such a thing.&#x201D;</p><p>Sure enough, a peak Half Martial Emperor-level old man that didn&#x2019;t belong to any sect or school spoke.</p><p>After hearing that man&#x2019;s question, all the people that were tempted perked their ears up. They were waiting for Nangong Beidou to speak about what sort of benefits they would be able to obtain. If the benefits were suitable, they would attack Chu Feng.</p><p>At this moment, even Baili Xuankong started to frown. Originally, he had thought this to be an opportunity to kill Nangong Beidou. However, if others were get to involved, the situation would become bad.</p><p>While he was not afraid of those mobs, it remained that there were many experts present. If the other three Imperial Clans and the Four Immortals were to get involved in this, not to mention killing Nangong Beidou, he would likely not be able to escape himself.</p><p>Thus, Baili Xuankong&#x2019;s brows were deeply narrowed. He was feeling the pressure of an enormous crisis.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
