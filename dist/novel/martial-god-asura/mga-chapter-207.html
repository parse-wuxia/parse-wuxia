<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 207 - Exterminate Your Shangguan Family</strong></p><p>*boom~~~~*</p><p>The pressure of the 6th level of the Profound realm came crashing down as the earth trembled. Many people found it hard to endure the ear-piercing boom, but when the ripples dissipated and the pressure faded away, everyone shocking found out that the group of people were not harmed in the slightest.</p><p>The reason why they were not harmed in the slightest was because of the huge screen in front of them. The screen was grey-coloured yet as transparent as crystals.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s...a Spirit Formation. It&#x2019;s a Spirit Formation!&#x201D; Suddenly, someone with sharp eyes recognized the origin of the screen.</p><p>&#x201C;What a strong Spirit Formation as it&#x2019;s able to hold the might of the 6th level of the Profound realm away. How strong would the World Spiritist who laid that Spirit Formation be?&#x201D; As they looked at the unbreakable Spirit Formation, everyone endlessly cried out their guesses.</p><p>&#x201C;A mere Shangguan family dares to attack my people? You must have gotten tired of life!&#x201D;</p><p>Just at that time, the curtains of the sedan chair was suddenly lifted and a body slowly walked out. When people saw the clothing of that person, they were instantly stupefied and the faces of some people were even pale-white from fear.</p><p>The grey-coloured cloak was full of symbols. As it was being shone by the sunlight, it even faintly glittered. Perhaps commoners could not recognize such a special clothing, but those who were there knew what that represented.</p><p>&#x201C;Grey-cloak World Spiritist!!&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, someone impulsively yelled out. After he spoke, it was like a bomb and it caused everyone in that area to no longer remain calm. Almost everyone there couldn&#x2019;t help but inhale a breath of cool air and both respect and fear emerged onto their faces.</p><p>Grey-cloak World Spiritist. What did that represent? It represented the huge characters who had the highest positions in the Azure Province because there was only two people like that in the Azure Province. Those two people were from the two strongest powers in the Azure Province.</p><p>In front of them, such a Grey-cloak World Spiritist appeared. That made people&#x2019;s imagination roam free as they first thought that it was one of the two huge characters.</p><p>But after some more careful thinking, they felt that something was off. After all, those two people were extremely well-known, and if any one of them fancied one of the two daughters, they would absolutely not come there with a fake name. They would clearly state their famous name for greater deterrence power.</p><p>However, if the person in front of them wasn&#x2019;t one of the two huge characters from the Azure Province, it meant that a third Grey-cloak World Spiritist appeared in the Azure Province. That was certainly shocking news.</p><p>&#x201C;Mister, I wonder who you are? Do we have any misunderstandings between us?&#x201D;</p><p>After seeing Chu Feng who wore the World Spirit Grey-cloak walk out, even Shangguan Yuea who had tough might before instantly shrunk down slightly. Even a first-rate school needed to provide offerings to a Grey-cloak World Spiritist, so he was truly not someone who his Shangguan family could offend.</p><p>&#x201C;There aren&#x2019;t any misunderstandings. Firstly, I came here today to marry the daughter of the city lord, Su Mei. Secondly, since I&#x2019;m here, I might as well exterminate your Shangguan family.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng nonchalantly smiled, and after saying those words with an aged voice, he waved his big sleeve and said, &#x201C;Attack!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Kill!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately after Chu Feng spoke, the elites of the Void School, under the lead of the head of the school, rushed towards the direction of the Shangguan family residences. On the road, any Shangguan family members were killed without discussion.</p><p>As they saw that, the powerful people from the Shangguan family knew that something was off and they quickly tried to chase after the group of people. At that very instant, all the able people from the Shangguan family were sent to the city lord&#x2019;s residence, so only the old, weak, sick, crippled, and those without strength to even tie up a chicken were within the Shangguan family residences. If the group of people slaughtered their way into the residences, the Shangguan family was certainly going to be exterminated.</p><p>&#x201C;No rush. Today, everyone from the Shangguan family will die!&#x201D; Chu Feng stamped where he stood, and as he spoke those words, a huge Spirit Formation appeared and sealed the direction that the Void School headed towards. It stopped all the Shangguan family members who wanted to chase.</p><p>At the same time, Chu Feng raised his hand and palmed towards the Shangguan family crowd. With a huge boom, almost half of the near thousand Shangguan family elites were injured or killed. There were even two people at the Profound realm within that group of people.</p><p>&#x201C;This person is extremely strong!&#x201D;</p><p>Su Hen tightly frowned as he saw that. Although the Grey-cloak World Spiritist only displayed the cultivation of the 1st level of the Profound realm, just from that palm, he could feel if he fought with him, he would not be able to defeat the Grey-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>*boom boom boom* From then on, Chu Feng threw out several palms and he didn&#x2019;t even use martial skills. He only used his Profound power, but every single palm could exhibit frightening power. It killed countless Shangguan family members.</p><p>&#x201C;You...truly go too far. I don&#x2019;t care who you are. Today, I will not forgive you.&#x201D;</p><p>As he saw the people from his own family being slaughtered like that, Shangguan Yue was incomparably furious. He revolved the Profound power of the 6th level of the Profound realm and pounced towards Chu Feng.</p><p>Shangguan Yue was truly furious. At that instant, he did not have a single trace of fear. He only thought about killing Chu Feng because he knew that if Chu Feng was killed, his Shangguan family still had a strand of hope to survive. However, if he could not find a way to kill Chu Feng, his Shangguan family would perish.</p><p>So, under those circumstances, Shangguan Yue&#x2019;s attacks were abnormally fierce. Every single punch or kick would have Profound power along with them, and every single strike and style could create devastating attacks. The martial skills that he grasped were also extremely strong.</p><p>Chu Feng did not want to expose his identity so he could not use martial skills. He could only use Profound power and Spirit Formation techniques against Shangguan Yue.</p><p>But luckily, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Spirit Formation techniques already entered the Grey-cloak realm. No matter how much fiercer Shangguan Yue&#x2019;s attacks were, he had no way of harming Chu Feng. Rather, they were all stopped by Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Impressive. Too impressive. Is this the power of World Spiritists? Grey-cloak World Spiritists. As expected from huge characters that can shake the entire Azure Province. This battle power is too terrifying.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re right. Clearly, the aura that he is displaying is only the 1st level of the Profound realm. Without even using martial skills and by only relying on the power of Spirit Formations, he can play around Shangguan Yue who is at the 6th level of Profound within his palms. This cannot be said to not be strong.&#x201D;</p><p>As they looked at the battle between the two, anyone who could see could tell who was strong and who was weak. They were shocked by Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength. Of course, they did not know that he was the young genius Chu Feng who shook the entire Vermilion Bird City with his name before. In their eyes, he was a true huge character. A Grey-cloak World Spiritist who had been cultivating for many years.</p><p>&#x201C;Old thing. The cultivation of the 6th level of the Profound realm is truly wasted on you.&#x201D;</p><p>At the same time that Chu Feng was blocking Shangguan Yue&#x2019;s strikes, he would occasionally attack the other Shangguan family members. Every time he attacked, he would prevail. With a blink, almost a thousand Shangguan family elites died under Chu Feng&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>At the same time, from the direction of the Shangguan family, miserable cries rang out endlessly. The Shangguan family were currently being slaughtered. No matter if it was a male, female, old, or young; chicken, dog, duck, or goose; anything that breathed would be killed. Even little mice that accidentally passed by the Shangguan family residences were grabbed by the Void School and strangled to death.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t that the Void School were cruel and merciless. It was because they received the death order. Chu Feng&#x2019;s order was to not leave a single life alive within the Shangguan family residences.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
