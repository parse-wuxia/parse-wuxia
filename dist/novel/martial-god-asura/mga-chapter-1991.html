<p><strong> Chapter 1991 - Killing Your Son</strong></p><p>Regardless, at thay moment, the crowd had already determined Wang Qiang to be Emperor Chi&#x2019;s successor.</p><p>There was no need for Wang Qiang to take out any proof. Merely his strength was sufficient to make the crowd believe him to be Emperor Chi&#x2019;s successor.</p><p>After Chu Feng left, at least half of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s ferocious beasts were killed by Wang Qiang. As for the people from the Dark Hall that died by his hands, they were simply too many to count.</p><p>Wang Qiang had actually contributed greatly to helping the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves obtain superiority in this battle.</p><p>&#x201C;Old P-P-Pervert W-W-World Devastator, j-j-j-just you wait. Once y-y-y-your gran-gran-granddaddy mast-mast-ers his d-d-divine attack, I&#x2019;ll t-t-turn you into a me-meat bun.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Bu-But, res-rest assured, I am n-n-n-not planning to eat you. I&#x2019;m ju-ju-just going to feed you t-t-to the dogs,&#x201D; Not only was Wang Qiang killing the Dark Hall&#x2019;s army, he was also publicly insulting the World Devastator Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;Damned stuttering brat, I&#x2019;ll make you shut up!&#x201D; The World Devastator Immortal was deeply enraged by Wang Qiang. Wang Qiang had been insulting him nonstop ever since Chu Feng had left. His heart and mind were both distracted by Wang Qiang&#x2019;s insults. After all, Wang Qiang was quite excellent with his insults.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Pervert W-W-World D-D-Devastator, do you kn-kn-know why I won&#x2019;t ea-ea-eat you? It&#x2019;s be-be-because your gr-gr-granddaddy is a ma-ma-macho man wh-who d-doesn&#x2019;t eat eunuchs. Hehe,&#x201D; As if he couldn&#x2019;t hear the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s threats, Wang Qiang continued to insult him.</p><p>Wang Qiang&#x2019;s insults caused the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s complexion to turn red with anger. He gnashed his teeth and wanted to bite Wang Qiang, that stutterer, to death.</p><p>&#x201C;World Devastator, even Emperor Chi&#x2019;s successor has come to assist us. It would appear that your defeat is inevitable,&#x201D; Lord Luokong said with a smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;What a joke. Luokong, have you gone senile? Do not forget the true purpose that we have come here for. It is that Moon Demon.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As long as the Moon Demon enters our grasp, how could you all possibly have any hope of victory?&#x201D; The World Devastator Immortal disapproved of what Lord Luokong had said. Even though they had entered a state of absolute disadvantage, even though the people from the Dark Hall were being killed nonstop, the World Devastator Immortal was still confident.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t forget that little friend Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal have gone after Luan Jie. Are you that certain that your son will be able to control the Moon Demon?&#x201D; Lord Luokong asked.</p><p>&#x201C;What? Chu Feng? You said Chu Feng? Hahahaha!!!&#x201D; After hearing what Lord Luokong said, the World Devastator Immortal burst into loud and frantic laughter.</p><p>As he possessed a very eccentric voice to begin with, everyone noticed his laughter. Even though they were still fighting, the crowd still turned their focus toward the World Devastator Immortal.</p><p>The World Devastator Immortal continued to laugh for some time. Then, he said, &#x201C;That trash Chu Feng? I know exactly how strong he is. He is only capable of being trampled underneath my foot. Him, against my son? He is also only capable of being trampled underneath my son&#x2019;s foot.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector of yours, they are only on par with Chu Feng. Even if they join hands, they are still nowhere near my son.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Is that so?&#x201D; Right after the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s voice landed, a voice sounded explosively from afar.</p><p>It was Chu Feng. When Chu Feng appeared, everyone turned their gazes toward him. Upon seeing him, the crowd all revealed astonished expressions.</p><p>Chu Feng, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the Elf Protector were all completely unscathed.</p><p>Not only that, there was also a giant net in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand. Contained within that net was a spirit body. As for that spirit body, it was none other than the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s son, Luan Jie.</p><p>Upon seeing the World Devastator Immortal, Luan Jie reacted as if he had seen his savior. He immediately shouted, &#x201C;Father, save me!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;!!!&#x201D; Suddenly the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s complexion turned ashen. In fact&#x2026; he was so stunned that he became speechless.</p><p>Irony. What an irony this was. Earlier, he had bragged of how amazing his son was, and how Chu Feng, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the Elf Protector combined would not be a match for his son.</p><p>Yet, what was this now? The son that he had believed to be so amazing had actually been imprisoned. Furthermore, even his corporeal body had been destroyed. All that remained of him was his soul, his spirit body.</p><p>Like an animal, he had been captured by Chu Feng within a net that was held in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!!!!!!!!!!!&#x201D; At that moment, the World Devastator Immortal was both shocked and enraged. He was shocked that his son had been defeated. He was enraged that his son had shamed him by losing.</p><p>However, even with this being the case, it remained that Luan Jie was his treasured son. For the sake of nurturing the growth of that son, he had exhausted a great amount of meticulous care and effort. He would absolutely not allow his son to die just like that.</p><p>Thus, the World Devastator Immortal pointed at Chu Feng and shouted, &#x201C;Release my son! Else, I&#x2019;ll dismember your body into ten thousand pieces!&#x201D;</p><p>The World Devastator Immortal was an extremely awe-inspiring individual. He was ranked second among the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s Ten Immortals. Anyone who heard those sorts of words coming out of his mouth would be frightened. In fact, they might even be scared to death.</p><p>However, when those words entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears, Chu Feng started to laugh. Then, he asked, &#x201C;What makes you think that you&#x2019;re qualified to say those words to me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your nonsense! I said, release my son! Are you deaf or what?!&#x201D; The World Devastator Immortal shouted again.</p><p>At that moment, he was truly furious. When he first saw his son in such a state, he had immediately unleashed an extremely frightening power to break away from Lord Luokong and rescue his son.</p><p>However, Lord Luokong had refused to give him the opportunity to do so. Thus, this vexed him enormously.</p><p>&#x201C;World Devastator, do you still remember how you treated me that day?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s mind tensed up. He would naturally not forget the humiliation that he gave Chu Feng that day.</p><p>It was precisely because he had humiliated Chu Feng like that that day that he was scared right now. After all, his own son was now in Chu Feng&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>Chu Feng did not immediately answer him. Instead, he reached into the net and grabbed Luan Jie&#x2019;s neck. Like grabbing a chicken&#x2019;s neck, he pulled Luan Jie out of the net.</p><p>Then, with a beaming smile on his face, he said to the World Devastator Immortal, &#x201C;The only reason why I kept him alive till now is so that you could personally see how your son dies.&#x201D;</p><p>After Chu Feng said those words, a flash of ruthlessness shone through Chu Feng&#x2019;s narrowed eyes. Then, his hand tightened. &#x201C;Bang!&#x201D; Luan Jie&#x2019;s soul was destroyed before the crowd.</p><p>&#x201C;Nooo!!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing his son being killed before him, the World Devastator Immortal let out an incomparably painful roar.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not have the slightest bit of sympathy toward such a World Devastator Immortal.</p><p>What Chu Feng could not tolerate the most was being humiliated by others. That World Devastator had relied on the fact that he had cultivated for a very long time, and his martial cultivation was very strong, to humiliate Chu Feng. As such, how could Chu Feng possibly tolerate that humiliation? After all, a warrior could be killed, but not humiliated.</p><p>Thus, ever since Chu Feng had survived the hands of the World Devastator Immortal, he swore that he would return the suffering that the World Devastator Immortal had inflicted on him two-fold.</p><p>As for the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s son, he was exactly like his father. He had relied on the fact that his cultivation was stronger than Chu Feng&#x2019;s to look down on him.</p><p>However, this was the consequence. The World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s son, Luan Jie, could only die by Chu Feng&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng had killed him right in front of his father.</p><p>Luan Jie had become the means for Chu Feng&#x2019;s revenge against the World Devastator Immortal.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
