<p><strong>Chapter 2566 - Forbidden Technique</strong></p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to say. Even I am uncertain, since I am simply unable to sense that Blue Gowns&#x2019; aura.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This can only mean two things. He is either not here, or his strength surpasses that of everyone here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I am certain that they have received assistance from that Blue Gown to see through my Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, it is most definitely also given to them by that mysterious blue-gowned individual,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s useless, he will not help us,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Why? Why won&#x2019;t he help us?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are we not of the same faction? Aren&#x2019;t we all planning to take care of that Chu Feng?&#x201D; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Sure enough, the target is me,&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyebrows narrowed. Merely from those words, he became certain that Blue Gown was aiming for him.</p><p>&#x201C;That guy is most definitely very strong. At least, his strength should surpass Senior Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s. But, with how strong he is, why didn&#x2019;t he attack me directly? Why did he instead help the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan from the shadows, and try to have them take care of me?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng pondered nonstop in his heart.</p><p>He was uncertain as to whether that Blue Gown felt it beneath himself to personally take care of him, or if he was unable to personally take care of him.</p><p>Or perhaps he was merely playing around, and taking all this to be a game.</p><p>&#x201C;Listen, we can only rely on ourselves right now. I&#x2019;ll be the bait, use that move,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said to the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief revealed a surprised expression. He did not dare believe what he had just heard.</p><p>As for the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s five Utmost Exalted Elders, they all revealed frightened expressions.</p><p>&#x201C;Are we really going to use that move? If we are to use that, there&#x2019;s no way around it,&#x201D; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;I said that I&#x2019;ll be the guide. Even if someone is to die, I&#x2019;ll be the one to die. What&#x2019;s there for you to fear?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we continue to consume our lifespan, we will all die. After we die, my Kong Heavenly Clan and your Zhou Heavenly Clan will both be extinguished. Have you thought about that?&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said furiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, you absolutely cannot. Our cultivation is insufficient. Even if the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief is planning to be the guide, with our cultivation, we too will die.&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, a Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder spoke with a panicky expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Shut up! For the sake of the continuation of our clan, so what if we die?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, another of the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders began to sternly criticize that Utmost Exalted Elder.</p><p>Furthermore, that Utmost Exalted Elder also said to their Clan Chief, &#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, let&#x2019;s do as the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief suggested. For our clan, sacrificing just our lives does not amount to anything.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, go ahead&#x2026; we are not afraid of death.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, please reconsider, please reconsider.&#x201D;</p><p>As for the remaining three Utmost Exalted Elders, there were those that voiced their acceptance of death and those that voiced their desire against it.</p><p>At that moment, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief revealed a determined expression in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Kong Jitian, it will be all up to you now.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shouted loudly.</p><p>A strange light began to flicker from his dantian.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhh!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>The next moment, the five Utmost Exalted Elders standing behind him began to let out miserable screams.</p><p>&#x201C;Nooo!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Stop! Lord Clan Chief, stop!!!&#x201D;</p><p>The Utmost Exalted Elders who had advised against this earlier started to beg their Lord Clan Chief to stop. At that moment, they were no longer able to control their bodies. It was as if they were all being controlled by the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>However, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief did not have the slightest intention of stopping.</p><p>&#x201C;That formation!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s five Utmost Exalted Elders were all emitting nine-colored lightning from their dantians.</p><p>That nine-colored lightning had not been present before.</p><p>Most importantly, after that lightning was extracted from their dantians, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the five Utmost Exalted Elders reacted as if something important had been extracted from them.</p><p>Their bodies started to rapidly age, and their skins withered incomparably. This was especially true for the five Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders. In merely the blink of an eye, they turned to mummy-like states. It was as if all of their essence had been extracted from them.</p><p>In fact, even their bodies shrunk greatly.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;ve used a taboo technique. This is their final struggle.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng shouted &#x2018;oh no&#x2019; in his heart. The reason for that was because he discovered that the nine-colored lightnings extracted from the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals were currently gathering toward the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>At that moment, not only was the Lightning Mark on the forehead of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shining even brighter, but lightning also began to appear on his body.</p><p>The lightning twined around him like armor covering his body. It was the Thunder Armor.</p><p>Although it was incomplete, Chu Feng, a Heavenly Bloodline possessor, was able to tell with a single glance that it was the Thunder Armor.</p><p>For the sake of protecting the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals as they set up the formation, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had been pinning down Ying Mingchao alone the entire time.</p><p>At the beginning, it was very strenuous for him to deal with Ying Mingchao. In fact, he was simply no match against Ying Mingchao. However, as more and more lightning gathered, as his Thunder Armor grew more and more complete, his aura also grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhh!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief let out a roar. Then, the Ancestral Armament in his hand grew even more ferocious. With each attack, he would give birth to wind and shake space itself.</p><p>Although he had lost an arm, he was actually able to contend against Ying Mingchao with one arm.</p><p>He was actually able to contend against Ying Mingchao alone.</p><p>Most importantly, after he let out that roar, the speed at which he absorbed the lightning extracted from the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals grew even faster.</p><p>Under those circumstances, the battle power of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>At that moment, not only was he able to take on Ying Mingchao alone, but he was also gaining the upper hand in their battle.</p><p>Soon, the screams from the five Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders grew weaker and weaker.</p><p>Finally, nine-colored lightning was no longer being extracted from their dantians. Their dantians had also completely dimmed.</p><p>&#x201C;Putt~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Putt~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Putt~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;.</p><p>Then, they actually all lost the ability to fly at the same time, and fell to the ground.</p><p>Dead. At that moment, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s five Utmost Exalted Elders, those five rank one True Immortals, had all died.</p><p>Furthermore, their state of death was extremely frightening. They appeared to have been sucked completely dry; there was not a single trace of essence in their bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing that, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed.</p><p>Through his observation with his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see that the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s five Utmost Exalted Elders even had their source energies refined completely.</p><p>As they were originally martial cultivation experts, their bones should be exceptionally hard even in death.</p><p>In fact, from a certain point of view, the remains of powerful martial cultivators would become precious treasures upon death. Their bones would be harder than even ordinary weapons.</p><p>However, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s five Utmost Exalted Elders&#x2019; bones were akin to those of ordinary people. In fact, their bones were even weaker than those of ordinary people. The reason for that was because their bones were actually all shattered.</p><p>&#x201C;That taboo technique is truly frightening.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng looked to the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief. At that moment, his dantian also stopped emitting lightning.</p><p>Furthermore, his dantian also stopped shining.</p><p>However, unlike the five Utmost Exalted Elders, his body&#x2019;s powers were not completely extracted.</p><p>Instead, he had voluntarily stopped the taboo technique.</p><p>Perhaps it might be because of his cultivation, or perhaps it was because of something else, but the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was not only still standing on the sky, his cultivation did not decrease either.</p><p>He was still a rank two True Immortal.</p><p>However, his current appearance was akin to that of a mummy. All of his hair had fallen from his head. His wrinkled skin was tightly wrapping around his bones. It was as if all of his flesh was gone.</p><p>His eyes were caved in. At a glance, he looked like a dead man who had just crawled out of his coffin. It was a truly frightening sight.</p><p>Although his cultivation was still present, his aura had become extremely weak. It was as if he was seriously injured. He was no longer able to join the battle between the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and Ying Mingchao.</p><p>From that, it could be seen that even though he had survived, the taboo technique had done enormous harm to him.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
