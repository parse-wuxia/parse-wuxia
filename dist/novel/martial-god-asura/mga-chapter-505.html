<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 505 - Spirit Formation Essence</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In the past years, in order to help you prolong your life, have I spent a small amount of resources on you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I treat you like this, yet you repay me in such a way and actually don&#x2019;t care about the survival of the dynasty. Are you still human? You are simply an animal!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*cough cough cough cough cough~~~* The dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor continuously coughed from anger. Mouthfuls and mouthfuls of blood kept on spraying out from his mouth. Both of his hands pushed against the floor, as from top to bottom, his entire body was intensely quivering.</span></p><p><span style="">The current ruler of the Jiang Dynasty&#x2019;s life was presently flowing away rapidly. At present, he was already on the border of life and death.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Oh brother, this is exactly the so-called &#x2018;Without being ruthless, one cannot be a man&#x2019;. For survival, I can do anything. Before long, the Jiang Dynasty will accompany your death. So, go die without worries.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The supreme elder fully revealed his killing intent. Seeing his younger brother who was made completely unrecognizable and horribly mangled by himself, he actually didn&#x2019;t show any traces of being sorry. Instead, he wanted to kill his own blood brother.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Old beast, your life shall rest!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But just at that time, Chu Feng used the power of lightning and raised his cultivation to the 1st level of the Heaven realm. He waved the Asura Ghost Axe, explosively shot a black-coloured blade of light, and it flew towards the supreme elder.</span></p><p><span style="">Although he wasn&#x2019;t too close with the dynasty&#x2019;s old ancestor, he was not willing to just watch a decent old man be killed by someone. So, he had to make a move. Even though he clearly knew he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to defeat his opponent, at least he could buy some time.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. Even a little ant like you dares to attack me? You are truly looking to die.&#x201D; Seeing that, the supreme elder coldly snorted, and without even moving his hand, a layer of Heaven power was spread out, immediately crushing and shattering the black-coloured blade of light. Furthermore, with horrifying pressure, the Heaven power was going to engulf Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit! A person in the 8th level of the Heaven realm is really too terrifying. In front of him, I do not have any ability to return the attacks.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Chu Feng tightly furrowed his brows and his face changed greatly because he astonishedly discovered in front of the Heaven power, his body was already bound and what awaited him was an unstoppable, terrifying attack that could not be dodged.</span></p><p><span style="">With the power that the Heaven power contained, it could definitely burst Chu Feng into a pool of blood.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom*</span></p><p><span style="">But in the moment when everything was hanging by a single thread, an explosion suddenly rang out behind Chu Feng. At the same time, a body appeared in front of him like a ghost. Its palm opened, then the horrifying Heaven power disappeared like smoke dissipating and cloud dispersing.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the Monstrous Monkey King. After the Monstrous Monkey King received Chu Feng&#x2019;s signal, it immediately came over.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is happening?&#x201D; At that instant, the emperor of the Jiang dynasty as well as experts such as Jiang Hengyuan all ran inside. When they saw the scene in front of their eyes, all of them didn&#x2019;t know what to do.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Monkey Bro, quickly protect the old ancestor. The supreme elder wants to kill him!&#x201D; Chu Feng hurriedly said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I knew that this old thing wasn&#x2019;t a kind one. I&#x2019;ll put him to his place right now.&#x201D; The Monstrous Monkey King did not waste any time with words as well. The red glare in his eyes flickered as he became a blur, rushing towards the supreme elder.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Even if you don&#x2019;t die, within a short period of time, your body will not recover either.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Jiang dynasty&#x2019;s later generation, quickly leave the continent of the Nine Provinces and yield this piece of land, or else what awaits you is the eradication of the Jiang Dynasty! Hahaha!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that instant, the supreme elder did not exchange blows with the Monstrous Monkey King. Instead, he turned, and circled around the Monstrous Monkey King with a strange angle. With bursts of cold laugher, he escaped.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, the Monstrous Monkey King also did not chase as of the people there, the one it was most concerned about was only Chu Feng. If some change happened to Chu Feng after it left, the losses would not outweigh the gains.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Father, Father, are you okay?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ancestor! Heavens, what exactly is going on here? Chu Feng, what exactly happened here?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After the supreme elder left, the Jiang Dynasty crowd hurriedly rushed towards their old ancestor. As they did their best to control the old ancestor&#x2019;s injuries, they asked Chu Feng about the ins and outs of what happened.</span></p><p><span style="">And after knowing everything, the expressions of the people from the Jiang Dynasty rapidly changed and on their faces, unprecedented worry surged, as if their last days had arrived. After stabilizing the old ancestor&#x2019;s injuries, with the lead of the emperor, they backed out of the Emperor Tomb.</span></p><p><span style="">As for Gu Tianchen and the others from the World Spirit Guild, they also feared the dangers of the Emperor Tomb, and chose to back out as well.</span></p><p><span style="">At that very instant, only Chu Feng and the Monstrous Monkey King remained. Chu Feng was not willing to leave just like that, and the Monstrous Monkey King was the same.</span></p><p><span style="">So, the two of them didn&#x2019;t care about the hidden risks within the Emperor Tomb and decided to continue deeper in. However, before walking for long, the Monstrous Monkey King&#x2019;s face changed and said, &#x201C;My guess was indeed correct. There are indeed obstructions in his place. Moreover, extremely powerful Spirit Formation obstructions.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Monkey Bro, why so?&#x201D; Chu Feng confusedly asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, look at this.&#x201D; Suddenly, the Monstrous Monkey King leaped, and when it appeared again, it was already a hundred meters away from Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly ran over. Only then did he discovered under the Monstrous Monkey King&#x2019;s feet, there was a pool of water.</span></p><p><span style="">To be more precise, it was not ordinary water because the water was extremely clear. In addition to that, there was even faint brilliance and from the little pool of water, Chu Feng felt extremely wild energy as well as extremely dense spiritual power, Origin power, Profound power, and Heaven power.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Monkey Bro, what is this?&#x201D; Chu Feng felt endlessly shocked because he felt that this thing, that gathered all the energy in the air, would have amazing effects in cultivation and was a precious cultivating treasure.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is Spirit Formation Essence.&#x201D; The Monstrous Monkey King said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Spirit Formation Essence?&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s interest multiplied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Spirit Formations are very powerful. They can block the attacks that humans make, but it cannot block the World&#x2019;s Energy flowing in the air.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The so-called World&#x2019;s Energy also includes spiritual power, Origin power, Profound power, Heaven power, and even the more powerful Martial power, as well as other formless energies in the world. They are all World&#x2019;s Energy.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, when a type of Spirit Formation reaches a certain degree of strength, it can block the flow of the World&#x2019;s Energy, and when this type of Spirit Formation has many years of existence, it will convert all the World&#x2019;s Energy it stopped into physical form. This, is Spirit Formation Essence.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;And since Spirit Formation Essence has appeared in this place, it means that there should originally be a Spirit Formation here, yet right now, there is nothing and only Spirit Formation Essence remains. This only indicates one thing. The Spirit Formation was broken by someone. Broken without leaving any trace at all.&#x201D; As the Monstrous Monkey King spoke, it carefully looked everywhere, seemingly wanting to find hints of the Spirit Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then it means that this Spirit Formation Essence is truly a treasure!&#x201D; But compared to the worry of the Monstrous Monkey King, Chu Feng was not interested in the Spirit Formation. What he felt interested in was only the Spirit Formation Essence.</span></p><p><span style="">As he spoke, Chu Feng took out a jade bottle that stored medicinal pellets from his Cosmos Sack and after pouring the pellets out, he started to gather the Spirit Formation Essence on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you doing?! This Spirit Formation Essence is extremely berserk, do not touch it!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s said that there was once a powerful World Spiritist who wanted to extract the World&#x2019;s Energy from the Spirit Formation Essence. He laid a huge, special formation and took out all the frenzied energy from the Spirit Formation Essence, then consumed and refined the Spirit Formation Essence as if it was a Heaven medicine.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But at the end, because there was still a bit of wild energy remaining within the Spirit Formation Essence not taken away, it caused the World Spiritist to lose his life because of that. So, this Spirit Formation Essence has been determined as a dangerous object. Everyone who sees it only keeps a distance.&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions, the Monstrous Monkey King&#x2019;s face changed greatly, hurriedly speaking to stop him.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
