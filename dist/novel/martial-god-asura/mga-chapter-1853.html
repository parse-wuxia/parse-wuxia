<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1853 - Within The Grasp Of One&#x2019;s Palm</strong></p><p>After triggering that spirit formation, Chu Feng did not stay there. Instead, he continued onward toward the World&#x2019;s Hidden Valley.</p><p>The reason for that was because if he were to stand his ground, it would be too obvious. It would be as if he was telling his opponent that he had discovered the spirit formation. Only by continuing to move onward was he able to make everything appear to be normal and make his opponent take the bait.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, who do you think will be the one that will end up ambushing you later?&#x201D; Eggy asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;As far as I know, the strongest person behind Song Yuheng is his grandfather. If my guess is correct, it should be that grandfather of his,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;I think that&#x2019;s the case too. Song Yuheng and his father both appeared to be very stupid. The reason why Song Yuheng was able to obtain that Duan Jidao&#x2019;s acknowledgement was all because of his grandfather,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s why his grandfather is probably the main culprit behind all this. If I can eliminate his grandfather here, I would have swept clean an enormous obstacle for little brother Wushang,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh you, you only know about thinking for the sake of your brother,&#x201D; Eggy curled her lips. She was only concerned about whether or not Chu Feng would be able to obtain benefits for himself, and was not at all concerned about his brother&#x2019;s life and death.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Not long after Chu Feng continued on with his journey, a powerful aura appeared out of nowhere and covered his surroundings, sealing them off completely. It was a layer of spirit formation. Someone had used a spirit formation to seal off Chu Feng&#x2019;s surroundings and cage him within it.</p><p>As long as that spirit formation was present, regardless of how enormous a thing were to happen here, regardless of how much destruction and devastation happened here, no one would know.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; At this moment, Chu Feng laughed lightly. Then, he turned his gaze toward the southeast. The reason for that was because the fox had finally shown its tail. That snake that he was luring out had finally left its hole.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng fixed his gaze at that region. The space there was slightly trembling. Then, an old man with a very sinister gaze walked out from that region of space. That person was none other than Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather.</p><p>&#x201C;You knew I was here?&#x201D; Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather was very smart. He had immediately discovered that the situation was amiss based on Chu Feng&#x2019;s reaction.</p><p>&#x201C;Why should I not?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled. His smile was filled with contempt. He had sensed that his opponent possessed a cultivation of rank two Martial Emperor. It was as he had guessed.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked. He had already determined the identity of his opponent.</p><p>&#x201C;How did you know? Impossible! There shouldn&#x2019;t have been anyone that told you about this!&#x201D; Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather started to panic. He was worried that his evil plot had been exposed. Chu Feng had never met him before, yet he knew who he was. This caused him to be extremely worried.</p><p>&#x201C;Told me? There&#x2019;s simply no need for others to tell me. That spirit formation you set up earlier was too obvious. Only a fool would not be able to see through it,&#x201D; Chu Feng said mockingly.</p><p>&#x201C;No, impossible! How could you see through the spirit formation I set up?&#x201D; Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather had an expression of disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;I admit, you have some skills. Among Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, you could be said to be quite outstanding.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, did you think that the methods of a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist could be hidden from a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he lifted his right hand and emitted some world spirit power from his index finger&#x2019;s tip.</p><p>His golden-bright and dazzling world spirit power looked like a snake swimming in the water as it spiraled around Chu Feng&#x2019;s finger. However, that spirit power was filled with dragon marks.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!! You&#x2019;re a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?! How&#x2026; how could this be?! How could this be?!!&#x201D; Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather was deeply stunned. As he was proficient in world spirit techniques, he was naturally able to determine with a single glance that the spirit power Chu Feng had unleashed was that of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>However, he didn&#x2019;t dare to believe his eyes. He didn&#x2019;t dare to believe that a young man like Chu Feng would be a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. After all, this was something that was simply unprecedented.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be so shocked. All that you&#x2019;re seeing right now is the truth,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Originally, I had wanted to let you live. But since this is the case, I have no choice but to kill you,&#x201D; After panicking, Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather suddenly revealed his killing intent. After realizing how frightening Chu Feng was, he planned to go through with his intentions to the end and kill Chu Feng now to prevent future nightmares.</p><p>&#x201C;Come. Use whatever abilities you have. Allow me to see exactly how powerful the person who dared to pass off fake remains to deceive Duan Jidao is,&#x201D; Chu Feng extended his arms and raised his neck. He revealed an appearance that stated to Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather to come and attack him.</p><p>Seeing how much Chu Feng looked down on him, Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s expression stiffened. Then, he gnashed his teeth in anger and revealed a giant crimson axe. It was an Incomplete Imperial Armament. As he waved that axe, a crimson blade ray shot forth to hack Chu Feng apart.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather was not holding back at all. His axe strike was so powerful that, not to mention ordinary rank eight Half Martial Emperors, even ordinary rank two Martial Emperors would be killed should they be hit by that axe strike.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when that crimson blade ray was about to reach Chu Feng, a ripple appeared in the space before Chu Feng. When the crimson blade ray came in contact with that ripple, it disappeared as if it had sunk to the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D; Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather was deeply shocked. His face that was already pale had started to turn ashen. He was feeling more and more uneasy. The reason for that was because he had realized more and more that the young man before him was much more difficult to take care of than he had imagined.</p><p>Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s sword-like eyebrows narrowed. He shouted, &#x201C;I refuse to believe this!&#x201D; and then raised his axe to hack at Chu Feng once again.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After his axe strike was sent forth, even the void started to tremble. A majestic oppressive might instantly arrived before Chu Feng. Merely, that oppressive might was naturally incapable of injuring Chu Feng.</p><p>While that oppressive might was incapable of injuring Chu Feng, the golden axe strike that was flying toward Chu Feng could not be looked down upon. This was no longer an ordinary axe slash. Instead, it was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather had used his Incomplete Imperial Armament to unleash his trump card.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, even though his axe slash was extremely powerful and simply incomparable to the one from before, the conclusion was exactly the same as before. His axe slash came into contact with the space before Chu Feng and sunk into nothingness.</p><p>&#x201C;No&#x2026; impossible!&#x201D; Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather held the giant axe in his hand and began to step back repeatedly in midair. Then, with a stunned expression, he looked to Chu Feng. It was as if he was incapable of accepting what had just happened.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you done? Is there no other technique left? Sigh&#x2026; it turns out you&#x2019;re only of this level,&#x201D; Chu Feng shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather suddenly turned around and began to flee.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re trying to flee now? I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s too late,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve, and a layer of spirit power appeared before Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather. Then, Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather was sealed off by it. Chu Feng said, &#x201C;Of course, ever since the moment you appeared, you were destined to be unable to escape.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng looked to Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather that he had captured in his world spirit formation. An expression of contempt filled Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather had wracked his brains and meticulously planned to ambush Chu Feng here. Yet, he didn&#x2019;t know that the moment when Chu Feng triggered his concealed spirit formation, Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather was already completely within the grasp of Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you planning to do? If you dare to touch me, Lord Duan Jidao will definitely not let you get away with it,&#x201D; While struggling in Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation, Song Yuheng&#x2019;s grandfather revealed a malevolent expression and began to threaten Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
