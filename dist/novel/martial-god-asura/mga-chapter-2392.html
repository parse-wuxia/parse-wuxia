<p><strong> Chapter 2392 - Arriving Ferociously</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a burst of boundless energy ripples was emitted out from the humanoid clay monster&#x2019;s body. That energy ripple was so strong that Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong and Kong Cheng were all forced back repeatedly by it.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh no! That Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone actually still contained such a powerful amount of energy. That guy has completely refined it. I fear that it is unable to contain the power, and will soon explode to death.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng had been fixing his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes onto the humanoid clay monster the entire time. Earlier, he had been unable to see through it. However, now, after it had refined the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, Chu Feng was able to sense a boundless burst of energy surging about in its body.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng was unable to accurately analyze the power that was the humanoid clay monster&#x2019;s body, Chu Feng was able to sense how frightening that power was.</p><p>That power was so strong that it had already surpassed the limit of the humanoid clay monster&#x2019;s ability to withstand. If this were to continue, that humanoid clay monster would explode and die.</p><p>&#x201C;Husband, Chu Feng, let&#x2019;s get away from here immediately! That humanoid clay monster will not be able to contain that power! If it explodes and die, we will all be implicated by it and die too!&#x201D; Zhao Hong shouted. As she spoke, she grabbed Chu Feng and Wang Qiang and began flying backward. She had also noticed what had occurred earlier.</p><p>Even though they knew it was dangerous, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong all wanted to continue observing the situation. This was especially true for Chu Feng. He was very curious as to the identity of the humanoid clay monster. After all, it should only be the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan that were able move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p><p>Chu Feng was skeptical as to whether or not this humanoid clay monster possessed some sort of relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan. Or could it be that it was so powerful that it could disregard the power of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone and forcibly lift it?</p><p>However, most importantly, the power contained in the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone had clearly been completely exhausted when it was used as the foundation of the Hundred Refinements Stage&#x2019;s formation during its construction. As such, how could it still contain such frightening power?</p><p>Exactly who was this humanoid clay monster?</p><p>How did it manage to know that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone contained this sort of energy?</p><p>What was it using the energies for?</p><p>All kinds of questions were hovering in Chu Feng&#x2019;s mind. He deeply wanted to know the answers to his questions.</p><p>Thus, even though Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had evacuated, the three of them stopped retreating upon reaching what they thought to be a safe distance and continued to observe the humanoid clay monster.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Kong Cheng also flew over and landed beside Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;W-w-why did y-you follow us? G-get t-the hell a-away,&#x201D; Wang Qiang gave Kong Cheng an ill-intended side eye.</p><p>&#x201C;What, are you all the only ones that&#x2019;s allowed to enjoy a show?&#x201D; Kong Cheng returned the side eye to Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;It must possess some sort of method to confront this. Else, if this is to continue, it will not last for long,&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze had been fixed onto the humanoid clay monster the entire time.</p><p>Perhaps it might be because the humanoid clay monster might be related to the Chu Heavenly Clan, but when it entered the fringe of life and death, when it was most likely going to die from refining the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, Chu Feng actually deeply wanted it to survive.</p><p>&#x201C;Crash~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, that humanoid clay monster suddenly submerged into the Drought Demon&#x2019;s Damned Pond.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The next moment, light visible to the naked eye began to shine from the depths of the Drought Demon&#x2019;s Damned Pond. It was dazzling, abnormally dazzling.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a spirit formation! What a powerful spirit formation. It seems that it was already prepared beforehand. This is the measure it prepared to handle this situation,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said in astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, this spirit formation is very powerful. Likely, it is not the work of an ordinary world spiritist. Merely&#x2026; the power contained in the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone is too powerful. Even this spirit formation might not necessarily be able to control it,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, a loud explosion suddenly sounded from the region of water.</p><p>The next moment, waves began to surge about, reaching the sky. A burst of extremely powerful energy ripples soon swept in all directions.</p><p>&#x201C;Quickly, get away.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhao Hong did not dare to hesitate. She grabbed Wang Qiang and Chu Feng and began to rapidly fly toward the distance.</p><p>As for that Kong Cheng, he unleashed his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings and also began to rapidly flee.</p><p>The energy ripples were too frightening. Even though Chu Feng and the others thought that they had withdrawn themselves to a safe distance, the energy ripples appearing right now still surpassed their imaginations, and would implicate them.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuahh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, even though Chu Feng and the others were rapidly escaping, they were still caught by the spreading energy ripples. Even Kong Cheng, who was escaping even faster than them, was caught up by the energy ripples.</p><p>Fortunately, due to the fact that they were already so far away, Chu Feng and the others managed to escape the most powerful portion of the energy ripples. Thus, they only received minor injuries. To them, it was something negligible.</p><p>At that moment, rainwater filled the sky, and was gently sprinkling down. Merely, the rainwater was black in color.</p><p>That was not rain falling from the sky. Rather, what was sprinkling down from the sky was water from the Drought Demon&#x2019;s Damned Pond that was shot into the air by the underwater explosion earlier.</p><p>Chu Feng and the others completely disregarded their injuries and turned their gazes to the distance.</p><p>It was the location where the humanoid clay monster had been submerged earlier. It was also the center of the explosion.</p><p>Energy ripples were still present in that area. They were surging nonstop, pushing around the waters.</p><p>&#x201C;S-seems l-like it&#x2019;s dead. I c-can no l-longer sense any l-living aura,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not for certain. That guy possessed an extremely powerful concealment ability. Else, how could we be captured by it?&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Someone&#x2019;s coming,&#x201D; Suddenly, Chu Feng turned his sharp gaze behind him.</p><p>He had already sensed that there were several extremely powerful auras rapidly approaching from behind.</p><p>Among them were many Martial Ancestor-level experts. In fact&#x2026; there was even a True Immortal-level expert.</p><p>By observing with his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, Chu Feng had managed to see those people. Furthermore, he had also managed to see what they were wearing.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Kong Heavenly Clan. Quickly, we must leave!!!&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; Zhao Hong did not dare to hesitate, and immediately released her strongest world spirit. Then, by relying on the power of her world spirit, she brought Chu Feng and Wang Qiang and began to fly toward the direction of the explosion.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, please don&#x2019;t go.&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, a figure suddenly appeared before Chu Feng and the others like a phantom.</p><p>It was an old man. He was not tall, but remained very robust and muscular. He had white snow-like hair, but only a very scarce amount of it remained.</p><p>The headdress on his head was very imposing. Merely, his face was covered in wrinkles and age spots. As such, he looked very ugly. That said, even though his skin was all wrinkly, the complexion of his skin was rosy and filled with vitality.</p><p>Most importantly, standing there, that figure was like an insurmountable copper wall, an impassable iron bastion. Not to mention Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, even a peak Martial Ancestor would not be able to crash their way past him.</p><p>The reason for that was because this old man was a True Immortal-level expert.</p><p>An existence of his caliber was someone who stood at the apex of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He stood before Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong like a nightmare.</p><p>&#x201C;Junior Kong Cheng pay his respect to Lord Utmost Exalted Elder!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately, Kong Cheng knelt in midair.</p><p>&#x201C;Utmost Exalted Elder? Sure enough, he&#x2019;s someone f-from the K-Kong Heavenly Clan. T-this is b-bad,&#x201D; Wang Qiang revealed a difficult expression.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s good that you&#x2019;re fine,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder turned to Kong Cheng and smiled lightly.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, quickly capture them! Especially that Chu Feng, he nearly killed me earlier!&#x201D; Right at that moment, the following troops from the Kong Heavenly Clan arrived. From among them walked a man. It was Kong Zheng.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng and the others realized what had happened. Likely, after Kong Zheng failed to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, he had most definitely let out a signal for help. These Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s experts were brought over by him.</p><p>This was his alternative plan after failing to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. With these powerful experts from the Kong Heavenly Clan, he would naturally be able to save Kong Cheng.</p><p>Actually, Chu Feng had already guessed that Kong Zheng might do such a thing. He merely did not expect that the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan would arrive this quickly.</p><p>At that moment, they were completely trapped. Adding on the various conflicts they had with the Kong Heavenly Clan, and Chu Feng should be extremely frightened right now.</p><p>However, although Chu Feng was surprised, he did not think himself to be in desperate straits. After all, he was still holding onto his Evil God Sword.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
