<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 310 - Shh, Quiet</strong></p><p>Actually, after some counting, the day to the execution of Qi Fengyang in the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion hadn&#x2019;t arrived yet so even if Chu Feng rode Little White to the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion, he would still make it.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng was so hurried was because his current target was not the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion, but the Valley of Hundred Bends. Chu Feng had to save Qi Fengyang, but he was absolutely not going to blindly send himself to death.</p><p>In a situation such as that, the first thing that Chu Feng thought of was actually not to charge into the dragon&#x2019;s pool and tiger&#x2019;s cave with a single pike and horse. He first requested for help from Qi Fengyang&#x2019;s old friend, the mysterious expert hiddenly living within the Valley of Hundred Bends.</p><p>&#x201C;This is Chu Feng. Senior, something has happened, and I wish to pay you a visit. Senior, I hope that you can meet with me once!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior? Senior? Senior, are you here? I have something that I want to discuss with you!!&#x201D; Chu Feng arrived at the peak of the mountain but he did not directly break into the Spirit Formation to enter. He stood over the vast white clouds and extremely politely paid his respects to the hall.</p><p>After the matters that happened last time and from Qi Fengyang as well, he understood a bit more of the situation. Chu Feng felt that the mysterious expert who was hiddenly living in seclusion was very possibly a strange person. Facing a person like that, he had to follow etiquette. With some slight incautiousness, it could very possibly cause that person to be furious.</p><p>However, after having no results from yelling for so long, Chu Feng had no choice but to forcefully intrude. He first bowed, then said, &#x201C;Senior, I truly do have a request for something. Please forgive me for my impoliteness.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng spoke, he broke past the Spirit Formation and arrived outside of the hall within the clouds. At first, Chu Feng yelled a bit more, but after still having no results, he spread his Spirit power out.</p><p>However, he astonishedly discovered that on the surface of the palace, there was an extremely powerful Spirit Formation. That Spirit Formation was too strong. Not only was it difficult to break through, it could even cut off Spirit power.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, I do not know whether you are here or not, but right now, Senior Qi Fengyang is in huge trouble. Two days later, he will be executed in the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion. I hope that for the sake of the relationship between you two, you can save his life!&#x201D; As he was in a situation in which he had no way of stepping into the hall, Chu Feng could only loudly yell, but he received no reply.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, just leave it. Don&#x2019;t beg him anymore. Didn&#x2019;t Qi Fengyang say it? This person understands the things in the Azure Province better than anyone else. I believe that even without you informing him, he already knew about what happened to Qi Fengyang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But no matter if he is in here right now or not, he must already know about Qi Fengyang&#x2019;s matter. He chose to remain silent, so that means that he is a person who cares very little about relationships, and he wouldn&#x2019;t reveal his identity for the sake of Qi Fengyang&#x2019;s life.&#x201D; Eggy advised with hidden anger.</p><p>At that instant, Chu Feng was in a really difficult situation. It wasn&#x2019;t that he did not understand that reason, but he still wanted to fight for it because right now, the mysterious expert was his only hope in saving Qi Fengyang.</p><p>However, with some calculations of time, Chu Feng was forced to leave that place. Before leaving, Chu Feng who was unwilling to admit defeat still left a letter at the entrance. Similarly, it was begging for the expert to go forward to save Qi Fengyang&#x2019;s life.</p><p>At the end, Chu Feng left with no results and his journey over there was wasted. As he brought that disappointment, that helplessness, Chu Feng resolutely advanced to the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion. He vowed to save his sworn elder brother, Qi Fengyang.</p><p>Time passed, and with a blink of an eye, the day of Qi Fengyang&#x2019;s execution arrived. On that day, in the sentencing ground outside of the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s mansion, big characters from cities, powers, and schools from all directions gathered here.</p><p>Almost everyone in the Azure Province who had a head and face came. They did not want to miss out the moment of execution of such a shockingly big character in the Azure Province, Qi Fengyang.</p><p>Outside of the vast sentencing ground, people formed mountains and oceans. Qi Fengyang was binded by special chains all over his body and even his mouth was sealed tight. Injuries were over his entire body, his aura was extremely feeble, and he was laying down on top of the fourteen meter tall sentencing stage. Above his body was a big and sharp guillotine. Qi Fengyang was going to be split into two by the guillotine.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahh, such a good character dying like this is truly a pity.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yeah. Another Heaven realm expert so difficulty appeared in my Azure Province, but he will now actually die in such a way.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing worthy of pity here. He cannot escape from the crimes that he had committed. If he successfully killed Lord Mansion Master, wouldn&#x2019;t that be even bigger pity? No matter how much stronger Qi Fengyang is, he wouldn&#x2019;t be stronger than the Mansion Lord right?&#x201D;</p><p>At that instant, some people felt pity for Qi Fengyang, but some people also felt that Qi Fengyang deserved it. But as everyone was hurrying towards the sentencing stage, Chu Feng hiddenly sneaked into the inner sections of the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion.</p><p>The lord of the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion was a member of the Lin clan. He was called Lin Moli, and most likely exactly because of that special reason, he could not tolerate Qi Fengyang who also entered the Heaven realm because that did indeed threaten the position of him being the mansion lord.</p><p>But to Chu Feng, that was not the important part. The important part was that Lin Moli had a son. It was his only son, and Lin Moli doted on him extremely.</p><p>But regrettably, his son was trash. Not only was his martial cultivating talent extremely horrible, he was also addicted to woman. He was the trashiest existence in the young generation of the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion.</p><p>&#x201C;Baby, you&#x2019;re too beautiful. You&#x2019;re the most beautiful woman I&#x2019;ve ever seen! Be obedient and don&#x2019;t move wildly. I will take you as my wife and grant you wealth and money. I will grant you endless resources and let you become a martial cultivation expert.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No! Milord, please let me go please let me go. I don&#x2019;t want wealth and money, I don&#x2019;t want endless resources, and I don&#x2019;t want to become a martial cultivation expert. I only want to go home!&#x201D;</p><p>Within a luxurious palace, on top of a big bed, there was a female who was young and beautiful. She was curled up in a corner while trembling and sobbing.</p><p>On the other side of the bed, there was a fatty who had incomplete clothing and he was currently staring at that woman with tiger-like eyes. It was as if a wolf was staring at a sheep. Like looking at his own prey, he already drooled from lecherousness. That was the son of Lin Moli, Lin Chong.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn woman. You don&#x2019;t give face and you don&#x2019;t want face? If you don&#x2019;t obey me, do you believe that I will kill your entire family, then throw you into the army camp and let my guards of the Qilin Prince&#x2019;s Mansion take turns with you until death?&#x201D; Seeing that the soft way didn&#x2019;t work, Lin Chong&#x2019;s face changed and he went for the hard way.</p><p>&#x201C;No! Don&#x2019;t harm my family!&#x201D; Indeed, after hearing Lin Chong speak like that, the woman knelt onto the ground and begged in fright.</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph. Then be obedient and don&#x2019;t move. You must cooperate. The women I dislike the most are those who don&#x2019;t cooperate. The women who didn&#x2019;t go along with me all got fed to my pet.&#x201D;</p><p>As he spoke, Lin Chong pointed towards a corner in the room. There was a Fierce Beast with a sinister appearance and blood-red eyes. The Fierce Beast was currently eating something. Looking at it more closely, it was a person.</p><p>Lin Chong did speak the truth. The women who did not cooperate with him were indeed all fed to that Fierce Beast. However, he did not tell the young woman that even those who did cooperate with him were also fed to the Fierce Beast.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll listen to you, I&#x2019;ll listen to everything.&#x201D; The young woman was terrified. As she sobbed, she nodded and started to take her clothing off and prepared to comply with Lin Chong&#x2019;s actions.</p><p>&#x201C;Waa!&#x201D;</p><p>But just as Lin Chong was preparing to enjoy the beauty in front of his eyes, his cherished Fierce Beast suddenly made a miserable cry.</p><p>Turning his head around to look, Lin Chong&#x2019;s face couldn&#x2019;t help but greatly change because his cherished pet already presently became a pile of muddled flesh. There was even a young man standing next to the pile of muddled flesh with an evil smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Insolence! Who are you? You dare to harm my pet?&#x201D; At that instant, Lin Chong was furious. He stood up and prepared to yell for someone.</p><p>*whoosh* But just at that time, like a ghost, Chu Feng appeared in front of Lin Chong. He used his hand to cover Lin Chong&#x2019;s mouth and fiercely pressed himself to the bed and strangely smiled and said, &#x201C;Shh, be quiet. I&#x2019;ll bring you to play something more exciting.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
