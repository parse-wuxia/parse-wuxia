<p><strong> Chapter 2287 - Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng understands seniors&#x2019; kind intentions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, seniors, there is truly no need for you all to worry excessively for me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ever since I decided to challenge Daoist Gold Star, I was already aware that I would become his enemy.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I have made preparations for him to come for revenge against me in the future,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng is truly bold,&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and the others no longer tried to say anything.</p><p>&#x201C;Speaking of it, I truly never expected that Daoist Gold Star would obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s spirit formation. That spirit formation is truly breathtaking,&#x201D; Su Jingrui said.</p><p>&#x201C;Regardless of how breathtaking it might be, didn&#x2019;t it still get broken through by little friend Chu Feng? Little friend Chu Feng is truly talented in terms of setting up spirit formations,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, indeed,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster and Su Jingrui nodded their heads repeatedly.</p><p>When making mention of that matter, the two girls Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu revealed idolizing gazes. To them, Chu Feng had already accomplished what was impossible for people of the younger generation.</p><p>He had undoubtedly become their absolute idol.</p><p>&#x201C;When mentioning Grandmaster Kai Hong, I remembered something. I think that you all might not know about this either,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui asked in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;Another of Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remnants have been discovered. Furthermore, this remnant might be the most authentic remnant left behind by Grandmaster Kai Hong.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remains might even be in that remnant. The wealth he gathered over his lifetime, as well as his powerful techniques, might also be in that remnant,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s such a thing? Where was it discovered?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui immediately revealed curious gazes. The two of them became extremely excited.</p><p>At that moment even Chu Feng and the other members of the younger generation present revealed curious expressions. Although Chu Feng did not know about this Grandmaster Kai Hong, he was able to guess from the conversation of the crowd that Grandmaster Kai Hong was a grand character when he was alive.</p><p>His remnants would definitely be extraordinary.</p><p>&#x201C;Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds!!!&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said. [1. The term for extremely remote in chinese is eight desolate. As in, the eight desolate directions away from the center. So&#x2026; NE, NW, SE, SW, N, W, S, E]</p><p>&#x201C;Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds?!!&#x201D; Hearing those words, even the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui revealed astonished expressions.</p><p>Chu Feng did not know about that place. Thus, he quietly asked Xu Yiyi, &#x201C;What sort of place is the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds is a forbidden area in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. That place has existed since the Ancient Era. It is a very dangerous place.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, it is said that there are still a lot of unsolved mysteries in that place. However, there has not been a single person capable of solving all of the mysteries there.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The reason why that place is called the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds is because there are many tombs there. However, all of the tombs are empty.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although those tombs are all empty, there have been a lot of people that have died in those tombs. The majority of them were all people that ventured into those tombs,&#x201D; Xu Yiyi said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case,&#x201D; Chu Feng now had a rough understanding of the situation with the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.</p><p>&#x201C;Why would it be there? Although the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds is very famous, there has never been any treasure to appear from that place. It is a truly inauspicious location.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How could Grandmaster Kai Hong construct his tomb there?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, how was this whole thing discovered?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Speaking of it, it is truly fascinating. Reportedly, a demonic woman appeared in the vicinity of the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;Demonic woman?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes immediately started to shine.</p><p>&#x201C;What kind of demonic woman?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It was an extremely ugly demonic woman that feeds on men,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said.</p><p>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart tightened. An ugly appearance and feeds on men? All of those features greatly resembled the description of the demonic woman that had captured Wang Qiang.</p><p>According to the old monk, there should only be one such demonic woman. Thus, Chu Feng felt that the demonic woman that the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster spoke of should be the same demonic woman that had captured Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x2018;No wonder that demonic woman never returned to the Darknight Ghost Forest. It turns out it had gone to that place,&#x2019; Upon remembering that demonic woman, Chu Feng felt overwhelming fury. However, Chu Feng did not say those words. Instead, with a calm expression, he continued to listen to the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster.</p><p>&#x201C;As that woman had caused enormous problems, the surrounding powers began to attempt to capture her. However, that demonic woman was not weak. Even though the many powers had joined hands, they were still unable to subdue that demonic woman.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Feeling helpless, they ended up requesting reinforcements. After careful preparations, they finally surrounded that demonic woman outside of the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, no one would&#x2019;ve thought that that demonic woman would actually charge into the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds after being completely surrounded.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Had it been before, no one would have been willing to enter a forbidden area like the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds. Furthermore, those powers that had surrounded that demonic woman were also not very strong. They did not possess the qualifications to explore the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, due to the fact that the demonic woman had killed many people, those people decided to clench their teeth, brace themselves and charge into the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds after that demonic woman.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As the group pursued the demonic woman, they began to fight her. During their fight, they inadvertently discovered a remnant hidden underground.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After entering the remnant, the crowd obtained an astonishing discovery. They discovered that the place that they had excavated was only the tip of the iceberg for that remnant.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They discovered that hidden deep underneath the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds was an extremely enormous remnant. Likely, there were a lot of treasures hidden in that remnant.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, due to the fact that the remnant was very dangerous, it was simply impossible for those people that discovered it to penetrate deeply. As such, they could only search for others to help them. That was how the information spread.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Afterwards, more and more capable individuals rushed to that remnant in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There were Immortal-cloak World Spiritists that felt that it was very possible that the remnant was left behind by Grandmaster Kai Hong, that the largest of the remnant would be where Grandmaster Kai Hong buried himself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that moment, the various powers are all proceeding for that place.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In fact, I was thinking that we should proceed for the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds together after our appointment is over.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After all, if it is truly the remnant where Grandmaster Kai Hong buried himself, it would definitely be a place filled with treasures.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps we might also be able to obtain some benefits,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;If that truly is the case, then we must indeed go and participate in the liveliness,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master was also looking forward to it very much.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, has that demonic woman been captured?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;How could those people have the heart to concern themselves with the demonic woman after discovering the remnants and treasures? The demonic woman has fled.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I&#x2019;ve heard that, for some unknown reason, even though there were many people trying to capture that demonic woman, she still lingers around the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds,&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster said.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you know her exact location?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That I do. It&#x2019;s at a place outside of the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds by the name of Fallen Goose Mountain Range. The demonic woman has been appearing in the vicinity of that place constantly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, why are you so interested in this?&#x201D; The Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster asked curiously. The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master, Su Jingrui and the others also cast curious gazes toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;I was merely curious. I never expected there to be such a baffling creature in this world, a creature that would only feed on men,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>He had not said the truth. The reason for that was because he knew that the Ying Imperial Clan would soon order his arrest.</p><p>As Chu Feng had already made enemies with a lot of people, he did not wish to implicate the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.</p><p>However, if he were to tell them that there was grievance between him and that demonic woman, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall would likely not sit and watch and remain indifferent. They would most likely try to provide assistance to help Chu Feng take care of that demonic woman.</p><p>However, that demonic woman was currently located in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds, a place where many powers were gathered.</p><p>Thus, for the sake of not implicating the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, Chu Feng planned to take care of the demonic woman by himself.</p><p>Although Chu Feng knew that that demonic woman was very strong, it remained that Chu Feng still had another Immortal Transformation Pellet given to him by the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p><p>That last Immortal Transformation Pellet was capable of increasing Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation to that of a rank five Martial Ancestor.</p><p>Even though he would have increased his cultivation his spirit power, and the power of his Heavenly Bloodline, as well as his heaven-defying battle power, would be sealed, however it remained that he would become a rank five Martial Ancestor.</p><p>Chu Feng refused to believe that demonic woman would be so powerful that she could contend against a rank five Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
