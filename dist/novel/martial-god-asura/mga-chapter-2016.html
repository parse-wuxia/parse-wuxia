<p><strong> Chapter 2016 - Assimilation Failure</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Boy, are you planning to challenge us Five Immortals?&#x201D;</p><p>After the three Immortal Profound Techniques were revealed, they looked to Chu Feng without much surprise. It seemed as if they all knew that they had fallen into Chu Feng&#x2019;s possession. Furthermore, they knew what Chu Feng was planning to do.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, please lend this junior your strength,&#x201D; Chu Feng clasped his fist. Although the three figures before him were all secret skills, they were seniors in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>After all, they were beings that had existed since the Ancient Era.</p><p>&#x201C;Boy, this Immortal will not bother with superfluous words. That said, I do admire your courage.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since you are determined, and have already assimilated the Water Immortal and Fire Immortal, you possess the qualifications to challenge us Five Immortals.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, if you truly wish to attempt the challenge, you can start with this Immortal. I also wish to see exactly how qualified you are, and whether or not you will be able to withstand the pressure of three secret skills,&#x201D; The Gold Immortal Profound Technique said. It wanted Chu Feng to attempt to merge with it first.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, I plan to assimilate all three of you at the same time,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the three great secret skills were all startled.</p><p>&#x201C;After all, there are two possibilities. Either I succeed, or I fail.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I do not wish to waste time. Seniors, you can all come do it together,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Boy? What are you talking about? This sort of thing cannot be joked around with!!!&#x201D; At that moment, the three great secret skills were astonished.</p><p>If they were to assimilate with Chu Feng in succession, Chu Feng would have the chance to give up midway. However, if the three of them were to assimilate with Chu Feng together, Chu Feng would be betting everything in one go. It was truly dangerous.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, it has been tens of thousands of years since the Ancient Era. Do you all not want to know exactly what sort of secret the Five Elements Old Ancestor left in your bodies?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am certain that you all wish to know. And I&#x2026; wish to know even more. I plan to undo this mystery. As such, I need seniors&#x2019; assistance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, please,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he closed his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. Since you are this courageous, we shall help you accomplish your aim.&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, determined gazes appeared in the eyes of the three great secret skills. Then, the three of them turned into three rays of light and entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s body at the same time.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s closed eyes suddenly opened.</p><p>Chu Feng felt as if his body were undergoing a chaotic storm. Five boundlessly powerful energies were now gathered in his body.</p><p>The power emitted by the fusion of these five energies was extremely frightening. They were flowing through Chu Feng&#x2019;s entire body, and had even entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s dantian.</p><p>It was as if the five energies could cause Chu Feng&#x2019;s body to explode, and shatter his soul at any moment.</p><p>Chu Feng clenched his teeth tightly. He was unwilling to give up. He knew that success or failure would be determined by this test.</p><p>There were two reasons why Chu Feng continued to stubbornly persist.</p><p>Firstly, he deeply wished to succeed.</p><p>Secondly, he was absolutely confident in himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a loud explosion sounded from Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. Following that, an enormous body of energy formed with the different powers of gold, wood, water, fire and earth instantly engulfed the palace that Chu Feng was in.</p><p>The materials used to construct the palace were very special. Furthermore, they were reinforced with spirit formations. As such, the palace was extremely sturdy. However, before the five elemental energies, the building was extremely weak. Like a bubble, it was turned to dust in an instant.</p><p>Furthermore, the five elemental energies were still spreading and devastating everything in their path.</p><p>Fortunately, the place where Chu Feng lived was a large isolated territory.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng&#x2019;s mood was not good. Thus, he did not have any servants in his palace.</p><p>All the buildings in Chu Feng&#x2019;s territory were destroyed. However, fortunately, there were no deaths caused by the five elemental energies.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a boundless body of energy soared into the sky. This scene astonished all of the people in the Cyanwood Mountain. They were afraid that they were being attacked.</p><p>After all, the battle between them and the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace had just ended. No one could be certain whether or not the armies of the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace had truly left.</p><p>At that moment, everyone started to panic. Some elders were even shivering in fear.</p><p>This could not be blamed on them. Rather, the five elemental energies were truly too frightening.</p><p>&#x201C;Crap!&#x201D; However, when the grand characters such as the Weaponry Refinement Immortal saw this scene, they immediately started to fly toward the five elemental energies without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>They all guessed that this was most definitely caused by Chu Feng&#x2019;s assimilation of the Five Elements Secret Skills. However, the current state of affairs appeared to be extremely bad.</p><p>Unfortunately, when the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others approached Chu Feng&#x2019;s territory, they were unable to enter the five elemental energies. The five elemental energies blocked heaven and earth. They turned into an enormous vortex that spun around through heaven and earth.</p><p>The five elemental energies were fatal. Even for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others, they were unable to charge their way into them. If they were to forcibly enter, they would undoubtedly die.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Could it be--?!&#x201D;</p><p>Soon, Baili Xuankong, Nangong Longjian and the others also arrived. Although Chu Feng did not mention his plan to assimilate with the Five Elements Secret Skills to them, they managed to guess what had happened from the frightening energies before them.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, it&#x2019;s Chu Feng. Chu Feng had just told us that he would assimilate the Five Elements Secret Skills. Furthermore, before that, he also explained the method of setting that grand defensive formation up to us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He wanted us to set up the grand defensive spirit formation to protect the Cyanwood Mountain should he fail in the assimilation,&#x201D; the Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, he actually did not mention such an important matter to me, that child&#x2026;&#x201D; After verifying what had happened, Baili Xuankong felt extremely pained.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t tell you all because he was worried that you would all attempt to stop him out of worry. After all, what he&#x2019;s trying to do is extremely dangerous,&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;But&#x2026;&#x201D; Baili Xuankong did not continue. He knew very well what Chu Feng had in mind. Merely, Chu Feng had still considered the safety of their Cyanwood Mountain even when attempting to do such a dangerous thing. As the person in charge of the Cyanwood Mountain, this caused him to feel extremely ashamed, extremely guilty.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s enough. Let&#x2019;s not talk about it anymore. Right now, what&#x2019;s most important is Chu Feng&#x2019;s safety,&#x201D; The Snow-haired Immortal shouted.</p><p>At that moment, everyone turned quiet. They all focused on the frightening five elemental energies.</p><p>The Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the other world spiritists began to use their various observation methods to search for Chu Feng&#x2019;s silhouette within the frightening energy.</p><p>As for Nangong Longjian and the other martial cultivation experts, they were using their special perception abilities to try and sense Chu Feng&#x2019;s existence.</p><p>Merely, the more they tried to find Chu Feng, the more uneasy the crowd became. The reason for that was because, other than the frightening five elemental energies, they were unable to sense anything else. They were simply unable to find Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura.</p><p>In this sort of situation, they ended up having no other choice but to wait for the dissipation of the five elemental energies.</p><p>Finally, after persisting for an entire day and night, the five elemental energies began to dissipate.</p><p>They dissipated very fast. It took only a short moment for them to dissipate completely.</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;.........&#x201D;</p><p>Merely, when the five elemental energies dissipated, the crowd present all revealed dejected expressions. Despair filled their eyes.</p><p>For Baili Xuankong and the others with superb relations with Chu Feng, they suddenly fell to their butts in midair with stunned expressions on their faces.</p><p>After the five elemental energies dissipated, an enormous crater was left in the ground.</p><p>Although heat was surging from the depths of the crater, they were simply unable to see Chu Feng&#x2019;s silhouette.</p><p>Not only did they fail to find traces of Chu Feng, they were unable to even sense Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura.</p><p>This conclusion was something that they were unable to accept. For this only meant one thing...</p><p>Chu Feng had failed!!!</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
