<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1705 - An Enormous Gift</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, even though the Du Clan has done unjust things to you, I can tell that Du Wanwu has sincerely treated you as a friend. I will not touch your friends.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let alone, even if I am to remove memories, I will only remove the memories concerning us. I will not touch any of the memories that contain you all,&#x201D; Baili Xuankong patted Chu Feng&#x2019;s shoulder to indicate to Chu Feng that he could be at ease.</p><p>Then, he said to Assembly Master Yin Chengkong and Elder Guan Hong, &#x201C;Chengkong, Guan Hong, I&#x2019;ll leave this matter to you two.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Understood,&#x201D; Yin Chenghong was the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly&#x2019;s Assembly Master, whereas Guan Hong was an Elder of the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly. However, before Baili Xuankong, the two of them were extremely respectful.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that Baili Xuankong was the true ruler of the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>After that, Yin Chengkong and Guan Hong began to remove the memories from the people from the Luo Family. Rather than saying removing their memories, it would be more accurate to say that they were altering their memories.</p><p>The memories they had before the Black Fiend came were completely unchanged. However, the memories they had after the Black Fiend came were altered. The change was that&#x2026; Goudan&#x2019;er, Chu Feng and Du Wanwu had eliminated the entire Black Fiend by themselves, saving their Luo Family.</p><p>Chu Feng, Du Wanwu and Goudan&#x2019;er had become the great benefactors who had saved the Luo Family.</p><p>Furthermore, not only did they change the memories of the people from the Luo Family, they also healed the injuries of those from the Luo Family that were injured.</p><p>At the time when they were changing the memories of the people of the Luo Family, Baili Xuankong brought Chu Feng along to the Five Poisons Mountain, saying that he had some things that he wanted to tell Chu Feng personally.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, even though you possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, and divine lightnings that can increase your cultivation by two levels, allowing your true battle power to be able to contend against ordinary rank eight Half Martial Emperors, there are also extraordinary people among the Four Clan&#x2019;s younger generation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As far as I know, there are many outstanding members of the younger generation in the Four Clans right now. Several among them are even said to possess heaven-defying potential that surpasses their predecessors.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you wish to humiliate them, you will not be able to do so with only a rank two Half Martial Emperor cultivation; you must immediately increase your cultivation,&#x201D; Baili Xuankong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Increase my cultivation?&#x201D; Chu Feng started to frown upon hearing those words. Only he knew how difficult it was for him to increase his cultivation. It was not that it was difficult for him to reach a breakthrough; merely, he did not possess cultivation resources.</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, I have already made preparations for you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Consider this my very first gift to you.&#x201D;</p><p>As Baili Xuankong spoke, he handed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng. Upon opening the Cosmos Sack, Chu Feng was immediately stunned.</p><p>The Cosmos Sack was filled with cultivation resources. Merely for Natural Oddities&#x2019; seeds, there were five different ones. As for other cultivation resources, they were simply innumerable.</p><p>However, there was one similarity in all of them. That was, they all contained a considerable amount of Natural Energy.</p><p>To Chu Feng, these cultivation resources were simply precious treasures. They were definitely capable of allowing Chu Feng to reach a breakthrough in his cultivation.</p><p>However, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t understand how Baili Xuankong knew that he required these things to cultivate with. One must know that, for ordinary people, they simply did not need Natural Oddities to cultivate with. The reason for that was because they would not be able to bear the berserk energy contained within the Natural Oddities.</p><p>Could it be that Baili Xuankong already knew about it when he was secretly protecting Chu Feng?</p><p>After being shocked for a moment, Chu Feng asked.&#x201C;Lord Ancestor, you&#x2019;ve seen the way I train?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, it was when you were at the Nangong Imperial Clan. While you were very cautious, I had a special method that allowed me to see through your concealing formation to see what you were doing.</p><p>&#x201C;Truth be told, I was truly shocked that day.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After that day, I had Yin Chengkong and the others help me gather as many Natural Oddities as we could so that you could increase your cultivation to a higher level in a short amount of time,&#x201D; Baili Xuankong said.</p><p>&#x201C;I have truly troubled Lord Ancestor,&#x201D; At this moment, Chu Feng was very emotionally moved. The reason for that was because this Lord Ancestor of his had truly spent great effort for his sake.</p><p>&#x201C;The disappearance of the Boundary Energy signifies the birth of an overlord. Indeed, the younger generation of this era are much more powerful than the ones before. I wish to make you an emperor, a ruler, the overlord of this era. For this, I will spare no effort.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t think about thanking me too quickly. I also possess selfish intentions for doing this. I hope that you can bring the Cyanwood Mountain to a new level after becoming the overlord.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I do not seek for our Cyanwood Mountain to become the strongest power in the Holy Land of Martialism. However, it should at least break free from the Nine Powers and become on par with the Three Palaces.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is my mission for you. What do you think? A lot of pressure, no?&#x201D; Baili Xuankong said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;It indeed is some pressure. However, only by having pressure will there be motivation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To speak of it arrogantly, to become an overlord is not my dream. Instead, it is only a natural path that I must follow in my cultivation journey,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Good, great arrogance. However, I like it. The Five Overlords, is there even one among them who was not arrogant? If one doesn&#x2019;t even possess arrogance, one would not be qualified to become an overlord.&#x201D; Baili Xuankong burst into loud laughter. It seemed like he was fond of anything that Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Ancestor, since you&#x2019;ve prepared this many cultivation resources for this disciple, this disciple will not hesitate,&#x201D; Chu Feng was very impatient to refine these cultivation resources. Since Baili Xuankong already knew of the way he cultivated, Chu Feng wanted to refine these cultivation resources right away.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t mind me watching, right?&#x201D; Baili Xuankong asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course not.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng smiled slightly, then sat down in a cross-legged position. He neatly placed all of the cultivation resources in the Cosmos Sack before him and then began to refine the cultivation resources given to him by Baili Xuankong.</p><p>As Chu Feng began to refine the cultivation resources, Baili Xuankong stepped back several steps. His eyes were completely fixed on Chu Feng.</p><p>After all, Chu Feng had set up a concealment formation that day. Even though he had been able to see what Chu Feng was doing, he had been unable to see it clearly. Thus, he did not wish to miss this opportunity to be able to see Chu Feng at a close distance.</p><p>After all, since ancient times, there was practically no one who dared to refine cultivation resources with energies as berserk as these. To refine these cultivation resources was simply equivalent to suicide. However, Chu Feng was able to accomplish this feat.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation method was also different from those of ordinary people. Ordinary people generally cultivated using Mysterious Techniques or hand seal techniques to absorb the Natural Energies into their body. The usage of the Mysterious Techniques and hand seal techniques was to eliminate the berserk power from the Natural Energies in order to prevent them from harming their body.</p><p>However, Chu Feng simply didn&#x2019;t use any hand seal techniques or mysterious techniques. Instead, he opened his mouth and sucked those Natural Energies into his stomach. It was only because Baili Xuankong managed to see it himself. Otherwise, he would definitely not believe that there was someone who could cultivate using this method.</p><p>How could this possibly be considered to be cultivation through refinement? This was simply eating cultivation resources. This sort of cultivation method was truly too savage.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing, exactly what sort of power is able to help you refine those berserk energies? That is definitely not Divine Power. Divine Power does not possess that sort of strength.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it really be an Inherited Bloodline? If that&#x2019;s the case, then it must be an Inherited Bloodline above Imperial Bloodlines.&#x201D;</p><p>As Baili Xuankong saw Chu Feng eating the Natural Oddities that could not be refined in a manner even more effortlessly than drinking water with his own eyes, he became both shocked and overjoyed.</p><p>He was shocked because of Chu Feng&#x2019;s power. He was in joy because of Chu Feng&#x2019;s power. At the same time, he began to guess exactly what the divine lightnings in Chu Feng&#x2019;s body were.</p><p>Because they were actually this heaven-defying!!!</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
