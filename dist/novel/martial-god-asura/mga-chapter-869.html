<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 869 - Outcome Decided</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;AHH&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, a heart-rending and extremely anguished scream rang out endlessly.</span></p><p><span style="">Other than that scream, there was nothing else that could be heard. The entire Stone Sword Sect was frighteningly silent.</span></p><p><span style="">It wasn&#x2019;t because there were no one in the Stone Sword Sect. Quite oppositely, there were many people in the Stone Sword Sect&#x2014;several tens of thousands of people.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the reason for such quiet was because they were all stupefied by Chu Feng&#x2019;s powerful strength and cruelty.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing the bloody Shi Jingtian rolling back and forth on the ground, one of his tendons extracted and his skin ripped off, the crowd truly felt chills and their hearts were beating heavily from their chest. An indescribable chilliness engulfed their bodies, causing all their hair to stand on end. They felt numb, and there were even many people who were trembling from fright. There were also a few who lost control of their excretory system.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What a ruthless brat. Since you&#x2019;re so cold-blooded, to prevent any more innocent murders, I will remove a beast like you for the sake of the Eastern Sea Region&#x2019;s population!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Lord Yan could not continue watching. As a person from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, he couldn&#x2019;t even protect someone who joined them. He felt he had no more face.</span></p><p><span style="">He first explosively shouted, then flew up. With an Incomplete Royal Armament in hand, he rushed towards Chu Feng with the powerful might of a rank eight Martial Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. You&#x2019;ve come at the right moment. Since you&#x2019;re from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, you shouldn&#x2019;t even think of leaving here alive.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t just feel fearlessness towards the incoming Lord Yan, he also sneered. Then, with the slight bend of his knees, he leapt forth. Like an inverted meteor, he flew into the sky and fought Lord Yan.</span></p><p><span style="">Violent shock waves brought about havoc. Powerful martial skills were used endlessly, and the battle between the two was undecidable.</span></p><p><span style="">However, their clash had truly frightened both the heavens and the earth. It was thrilling to the crowd, so as they watched, they sighed in admiration, yet also in fear and terror.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened? Isn&#x2019;t it said Chu Feng was a rank three Martial Lord when he first arrived at the Winter Plains? Why has he become a rank five Martial Lord after a few short days?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not even important! The important part is that Chu Feng, with the cultivation of a rank five Martial Lord, easily tormented the head of the Stone Sword Sect, a rank seven Martial Lord! Even Lord Yan, a rank eight Martial Lord, can&#x2019;t defeat him! This child&#x2019;s strength is too terrifying. He&#x2019;s even more powerful than the rumours!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Everyone could also feel Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation at that instant. They now knew Chu Feng was no longer a rank three Martial Lord, but a rank five Martial Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">However, they felt such shock and fright not because of his cultivation. It was more because of his fighting strength. Such horrifying strength was something they had never seen before. Likely only true geniuses could do such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What should we do right now? We&#x2019;ve already agreed to join the Immortal Execution Archipelago, yet this Chu Feng is so powerful! If Lord Yan is defeated, we won&#x2019;t escape death either!&#x201D; Amidst shock, some started feeling they couldn&#x2019;t be guaranteed their lives.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to be afraid! No matter how strong Chu Feng is, he&#x2019;s only a rank five Martial Lord. Although he is strong, Lord Yan has been the Third Immortal&#x2019;s subordinate for many years! He is no pushover. It&#x2019;s uncertain who will win in the fight between these two.&#x201D; However, there were also some confident people who felt Lord Yan might not lose to Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be foolish! Chu Feng isn&#x2019;t using his full strength right now! Back then, I personally saw how powerful he became after using the Royal Armament! He has yet to even touch it, so if he does, even Lord Yan will be defeated!&#x201D; Some people also felt quite certain that Chu Feng would win.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Doesn&#x2019;t this mean there&#x2019;s a disaster heading our way, and we&#x2019;re certainly dead today?&#x201D; When they heard those arguments, the experts at the peak of the palace had pale-as-paper faces. Their bodies trembled, and even some couldn&#x2019;t stand stably&#x2014;they almost fell on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="">They didn&#x2019;t dare to escape. If they did, the Immortal Execution Archipelago wouldn&#x2019;t forgive them. They would then completely lose their protection. However, if they didn&#x2019;t escape, Chu Feng clearly wouldn&#x2019;t forgive them either. Either choice was difficult, so they didn&#x2019;t know what to do. They only felt that a disaster was falling upon their heads and they had no retreat.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom rumble rumble rumble&#x2014;*</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that moment, an explosion rang out above. A person also shot out from the shock waves and into the distant mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, they could see the one still standing in the air was Chu Feng, and as such, the person who was shot into the mountain range was Lord Yan.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh* Suddenly, Chu Feng also shot forth and instantly disappeared. With a powerful aura, he rushed into the mountain range.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom boom boom boom boom*</span></p><p><span style="">Quickly after, they could hear bursts of rumbles resounding continuously in the distance. The energy ripple could even light up the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s escape! Lord Yan is no match for that Chu Feng! We will all die!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t escape! Chu Feng is so powerful! If he wants to kill us, how could we escape?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;In my perspective, we are certainly dead if we escape. But if we don&#x2019;t, there might be a chance at survival. After all, in the end, we haven&#x2019;t harmed anyone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect. We have also not truly joined the Immortal Execution Archipelago!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">The many experts atop the palace were indecisive. Their thoughts were incongruous: they wanted to escape, yet didn&#x2019;t dare to escape. That feeling of nervousness and uneasiness nearly made their minds collapse.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* However, just at that moment, the head of the Stone Sword Sect suddenly stopped his painful shrieking.</span></p><p><span style="">Radiance shone everywhere from his bloody figure, then a ray of light shot out into the distance&#x2014;it was a Consciousness. Shi Jingtian&#x2019;s Consciousness. Seeing he could not retain his life, he didn&#x2019;t give up. He abandoned his physical body and escaped via his Consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Where are you escaping!&#x201D; However, before he was even able to run for any sizable length, Chu Feng&#x2019;s furious shout rang out.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, a boundless suction power shot out from the faraway mountain range. It streaked above the Stone Sword Sect, and chased after his Consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2014;&#x201D; Quickly after, a painful scream rang out. A Consciousness flew across the sky, drawn over by the suction power.</span></p><p><span style="">Shortly after he was caught, Chu Feng flew over from afar and once again appeared above the Stone Sword Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">However, when they saw him again, the several tens of thousands of people in the Stone Sword Sect were absolutely silent. A single word was written across their faces: terror.</span></p><p><span style="">Because, at that moment, Chu Feng was not only undamaged, there was even a faint smile on his face. However, there were two bodies of light grasped within his hand&#x2014;two incomparably weak bodies of Consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="">Judging by their appearances, one was the head of the Stone Sword Sect&#x2019;s, the other was Lord Yan&#x2019;s of the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">The battle had concluded, the victor and defeated definite.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
