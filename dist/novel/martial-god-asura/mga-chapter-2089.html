<p><strong> Chapter 2089 - Fusion</strong></p><p>Seeing that the enormous Imperial Armament actually had a reaction, Chu Feng was delighted. Although all Imperial Armaments possessed a certain amount of sentience, it was the first time that Chu Feng had seen an Imperial Armament like that sword, a sword that actually revealed its sentience so clearly by attacking someone of its own initiative.</p><p>That sort of situation could be described with a single word: miraculous.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give you two options. You will either submit to me obediently and serve me, or I&#x2019;ll properly take care of you first and then make you submit to me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to that enormous Imperial Armament. He felt that this Imperial Armament was capable of understanding his words.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right after Chu Feng&#x2019;s words left his mouth, the enormous sword once again started attacking Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Interesting,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled and said, &#x201C;Seems like you&#x2019;ve chosen the latter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Then, Chu Feng leapt into the sky. The Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader he held turned into many silver blade rays that whistled through the sky like silver dragons and ferocious beasts that planned to shatter and tear apart everything before their path.</p><p>Regardless of how powerful that enormous Imperial Armament sword might be, it remained only a single Imperial Armament. As there was no one controlling it, its power was limited. As such, how could it possibly withstand Chu Feng&#x2019;s ferocious attacks?</p><p>After all, the current Chu Feng was someone that most rank eight Martial Emperors would not be able to match.</p><p>At that moment, the enormous Imperial Armament sword was gradually knocked back. The enormous body of the sword started to tremble more and more distinctly as it continued to let out ear-piercing cries.</p><p>Toward the end, that enormous Imperial Armament was only trembling nonstop, and stopped trying to attack Chu Feng. Not to mention it&apos;s killing intent from earlier, even its boundless Emperor&#x2019;s might from earlier had completely disappeared.</p><p>Under those circumstances, Chu Feng stopped his attacks. He narrowed his eyes and stared at the enormous Imperial Armament. He asked, &#x201C;Are you planning to submit to me now?&#x201D;</p><p>However, that Imperial Armament did not have any reaction to Chu Feng&#x2019;s words. It had chosen to remain silent, as if it had not heard Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that you want me to put you in order again before you are willing to submit to me,&#x201D; The corners of Chu Feng&#x2019;s mouth lifted into an evil smile. Then, he began to wave the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader that he held in his hand once again.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s attacks this time around were not as simple as merely using his Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader. The sky and earth darkened as a frightening burst of energy was emitted from the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader.</p><p>That energy formed an illusion throughout the region. It was an illusion of a ferocious beast. It had an appearance resembling that of a tiger or leopard, but was several hundred meters in length and contained an extremely frightening power.</p><p>It was a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill that Chu Feng had just grasped. It was the first time that Chu Feng was using this Heaven Taboo Martial Skill since it was a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill that he had just inherited from Qing Xuantian.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz, buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Seemingly realizing Chu Feng&#x2019;s power, and also seemingly recognizing that martial skill, the enormous Imperial Armament sword trembled violently. Even that region of space was affected by its trembling.</p><p>Finally, its trembling started to calm down. However, at that moment, the enormous sword was rapidly shrinking in size. In the end, from the size of a colossus, it turned into a two meter-long sword.</p><p>After that sword shrunk in size, the gate that Chu Feng was in also began to dissipate. Even though that Imperial Armament had yet to recognize Chu Feng as its master, it was clear that it no longer possessed any hostility toward Chu Feng anymore.</p><p>In other words, it no longer dared to emit any hostility toward Chu Feng. Chu Feng had subdued it with his strength.</p><p>After the enormous sword shrunk, Chu Feng was able to see its characteristics more clearly. Indeed, that sword did not possess a hilt. It was a broken sword. However, although it was a broken sword, that did not affect its power.</p><p>The dense Ancient Era&#x2019;s aura and the air of arrogance that the sword emitted both made it stand out from the masses. It was not only a slight bit more powerful than Chu Feng&#x2019;s Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader. Instead, it was much more powerful.</p><p>That Imperial Armament was a true top quality weapon among Imperial Armaments. Chu Feng even felt that if that Imperial Armament were to be completed, it would surpass all other Imperial Armaments.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his head and turned his gaze to the Emperor&#x2019;s Gate.</p><p>The more Chu Feng looked at it, the more marvelous of an expression Chu Feng revealed. The reason for that was because that Emperor&#x2019;s Gate was also not an ordinary Imperial Armament.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that my guess was correct,&#x201D; At that moment, a complacent smile emerged on Chu Feng&#x2019;s face. Even though he was already excited, he became even more excited.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng was so pleased with himself was because he had discovered that that Emperor&#x2019;s Gate was actually a complete Imperial Armament. However, on top of that Emperor&#x2019;s Gate, Chu Feng had discovered the traces of an enormous sword.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng was also able to find traces of the Emperor&#x2019;s Gate on the enormous sword. Furthermore, the location where the two traces were found was the location where the sword&#x2019;s hilt should be.</p><p>In addition to that, both the sword and the Emperor&#x2019;s Gate possessed a spirit formation over them. The spirit formations would not affect the two of them. However, they possessed a special sort of power capable of fusing the two of them.</p><p>If Chu Feng guessed correctly, someone had tried to fuse those two extraordinary Imperial Armaments together, making them one extraordinary Imperial Armament. However, that attempt had ended in failure.</p><p>Chu Feng felt that it was very likely that it was Qing Xuantian that had attempted to do that.</p><p>However, the discovery of those clues was not something that could cause Chu Feng to be this pleased with himself. The reason why Chu Feng was so pleased was because he felt that, with his current world spirit techniques, he might be able to accomplish what Qing Xuantian had been unable to accomplish.</p><p>In other words, Chu Feng was capable of fusing the two Imperial Armaments.</p><p>What sort of character was Qing Xuantian? He was the person the entire Holy Land of Martialism accepted as the strongest since the Ancient Era.</p><p>Chu Feng deeply respected Qing Xuantian. However, Chu Feng also wished to surpass Qing Xuantian. However, for the current Chu Feng, surpassing Qing Xuantian in terms of martial cultivation would be absolutely impossible.</p><p>However, if he could surpass Qing Xuantian in terms of world spirit techniques, it would still be something that he could be proud of.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Qing Xuantian, please excuse this junior&#x2019;s offense. I am going to fuse the two Imperial Armaments you left behind.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I think that if you were here, you would also support this junior.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because you are definitely the same as this junior, and would also want to know what sort of weapon these two Imperial Armaments will become after fusing together.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Without a doubt, it will definitely be an extraordinary weapon.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, Chu Feng began to set up a spirit formation.</p><p>That spirit formation was extremely refined. Chu Feng used tens of thousands of materials to set it up. The spirit formation possessed a total of a thousand three hundred and eighty-nine foundation cores.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques were extremely exceptional right now, it still took Chu Feng a total of nine days and nine nights to set up that spirit formation.</p><p>Logically, as Chu Feng was in a rush to return to the Holy Land of Martialism, he should not have wasted this much time on a single weapon.</p><p>However, Chu Feng felt that those two Imperial Armaments were both extraordinary items. Although they did not possess the same body, he might be able to create a weapon that surpassed Imperial Armaments should he be able to fuse the two of them together into one.</p><p>If he possessed a weapon like that, Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength would increase enormously. At that time, he would have a greater certainty in being able to defeat the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>Chu Feng did not wish to let such a great opportunity slip by him.</p><p>After Chu Feng finished setting up the grand spirit formation, Chu Feng placed the two Imperial Armaments into his grand spirit formation. Although that Emperor&#x2019;s Gate was still enormous, it was actually the same as that enormous sword. After Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s spirit formation was gone, it immediately submitted to Chu Feng after revealing his might.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
