<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 674 - Ten-day Limit</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Brother, is that true? You know you cannot lie about these things right?&#x201D; The rank two Martial Lord&#x2019;s current complexion was a bit pale, as though he was terrified.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s so true that it cannot be more true! If you don&#x2019;t believe me, go ask around. The people who were in the banquet that night personally saw it all,&#x201D; the young man guaranteed.</span></p><p><span style="">*gulp* Hearing this, the rank two Martial Lord swallowed some spittle from fear. Even cold sweat appeared on his face, then he said no more. There was no longer any hatred in his eyes when he gazed at Chu Feng. Replacing it was only deep trepidation.</span></p><p><span style="">In reality, similar events such as this not only occurred there. Many others who had seen Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength were also spreading it. In an instant, Chu Feng indeed became everyone&#x2019;s focus of attention. He became an existence that made others both envy, and fear.</span></p><p><span style="">As a World Spiritist, Chu Feng could naturally see and hear very attentively. Especially after arriving atop the mountain peak, he observed the crowd in a special manner. Thus, he naturally heard these discussions.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Chu Feng only lightly smiled at those comments and didn&#x2019;t pay too much attention to them. However, something undeniable was the events in the prior banquet made him famous.</span></p><p><span style="">For all things there were two sides: good and bad. Many people were afraid of him, but at the same time, there were also many people holding onto malicious thoughts, aiming to make a move for his Dragon Marking Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">Since what happened had already happened, Chu Feng was too lazy to care about those things. After all, the world was never peaceful. Unless there came a power that was superior to all, no one should think of maintaining tranquility.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Wuqing, that&#x2019;s the entrance to the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. There are two entrances&#x2014;one for collecting Martial Markings, the other for exchanging them for martial skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The first entrance opens today. It will remain open for two hours, and afterwards, it will close. As for the second entrance, it opens ten days later, the opening time being a single day.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Xia Yu pointed at the center of the square. There were two formations there with slightly weak radiance. However, Chu Feng could tell they were indeed two formations. Moreover, they were very profound, containing symbols and markings he could not understand.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That means one can only stay in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm for ten days, and after ten days, they must come out, or else they will miss the chance to exchange Martial Markings?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm. It is indeed like so.&#x201D; Xia Yu nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Xia Yu, then is it possible to enter the Martial Marking Immortal Realm then not come out to search for Martial Markings, and only exit six years later? At that time, I&#x2019;m sure many more Martial Markings will be stored up, and one can exchange them for even better martial skills,&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh, Junior Wuqing, you truly think too much. There have been people who has done this before, but really, it is a very idiotic action because six years later, not even any remnants remain of those people. Only the Immortal Talisman they wore when entering was still there. Do you know why this is?&#x201D; Xia Yu asked.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng shook his head, then asked, &#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s because the Martial Marking Immortal Realm is a very dangerous place. Almost no one can survive in that environment, and only in these ten days is the realm relatively peaceful. Remember, only relatively peaceful. Similarly, danger still exists.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Moreover, after entering the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, there is no exit. That&#x2019;s why there are only a hundred slots every time the realm opens&#x2014;one is required to bring an Immortal Talisman into the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The Immortal Talisman is an exit that can send a person out of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. However, there are only a hundred Immortal Talismans and they cannot be reproduced. So, that&#x2019;s why only a hundred can enter the Martial Marking Immortal Realm,&#x201D; Xia Yu explained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So it&#x2019;s like that. Thank you, Senior Xia Yu, for your guidance.&#x201D; Chu Feng finally understood the mysticality of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So, Junior Wuqing, after entering the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, let&#x2019;s walk together! Perhaps that way, we can guard your safety,&#x201D; Chun Wu said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah! Junior Wuqing, one more person one more part of safety. It will be better if the five of us are together,&#x201D; Dong Xue and Xia Yu said at the same time. As for Qiu Zhu, even though she hadn&#x2019;t said anything, she still wore a light smile, as though inviting Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Seniors, thank you.&#x201D; It was exactly the so-called &#x2018;hard to refuse great kindness&#x2019;, so naturally, Chu Feng wouldn&#x2019;t refuse the invitation of the four beauties. In reality, Chu Feng agreed because it was true that by being with them he would be safer.</span></p><p><span style="">Putting aside the fact that many of the people there possessed wicked hearts, there were many people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago who were entering the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.. Even Ya Fei was there. If they meet her within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, Chu Feng did not dare to guarantee that&#x2014;judging by her vile nature&#x2014;whether she will attack him.</span></p><p><span style="">Even with the Immortal Talisman, he could send himself out of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm at an necessary time, but it would be quite the loss if he missed the chance to procure large amounts of Martial Markings because of such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="">So, being able to go together with the </span><i><span style="">Four Seasons</span></i><span style=""> was the best possible choice. After all, the four of them were not weak, Qiu Zhu especially. She had strength&#x2014;a rank five Martial Lord&#x2019;s strength&#x2014;that was as powerful as Ya Fei. Within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, she could definitely protect Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Wuqing, Ladies, you&#x2019;ve come! Let me introduce to you my best friends.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Qin Yu, Lan Xi, Wang Long: the three of them are the representative disciples of the Four Seas Academy. Although they will leave it next year, they are, at least right now, the Four Seas Academy&#x2019;s most powerful disciples.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that moment, Gao Xiong walked over. Furthermore, two men and one woman followed by his side. A rather handsome male was called Qin Yu, the tall, big, and strong man was called Wang Long, and the graceful woman with a small figure was called Lan Xi.</span></p><p><span style="">The three of them were rank four Martial Lords. Although they had neared the age of thirty, that level of strength was quite powerful.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I am Wuqing. It is an honour to meet all of you.&#x201D; The first Eastern Sea Region power Chu Feng knew was the Four Seas Academy. In addition, Zhang Tianyi, Jiang Wushang, Su Rou, and Su Mei were all cultivating in the Four Seas Academy, so Chu Feng had a fairly good feeling towards those from the Four Seas Academy.</span></p><p><span style="">As for those three, as disciples of the Four Seas Academy, although they had already cultivated for almost four years, to be able to acquire their current realm did show that they had impressive aptitudes.</span></p><p><span style="">But Chu Feng heard that thirty people had come from the Immortal Execution Archipelago. Not only did they all come via the acceptance of Misty Badges, the weakest were rank four Martial Lords.</span></p><p><span style="">So, in comparison to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, when the Four Seas Academy&#x2014;a power that accepted people from the Four Seas&#x2014;had only three rank four Martial Lords as their strongest disciples, it had to be said it was really a bit weaker.</span></p><p><span style="">But that couldn&#x2019;t be helped. No matter how much more powerful the Four Seas Academy was, it could only be counted a mere </span><i><span style="">strong power.</span></i><span style=""> When likened to such an overlord-level enormous power such as the Immortal Execution Archipelago, it was too much weaker.</span></p><p><span style="">As for Qin Yu, Wang Long, and Lang Xi, they had very affable attitudes when facing Chu Feng. In reality, they had also heard Gao Xiong mention Chu Feng&#x2019;s achievements and felt he was a very rare genius, so they wanted to befriend him.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in comparison to Chu Feng, the </span><i><span style="">Four Season</span></i><span style=""> beauties were quite cold, to the point that they didn&#x2019;t even want to converse with the three from the Four Seas Academy. The pride the four genuis beauties had current reached its apex.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
