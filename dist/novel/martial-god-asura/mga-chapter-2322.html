<p><strong> Chapter 2322 - Craven And Cowardly</strong></p><p>Even though she was feeling scared, Xu Yiyi still gathered up her courage to ask, &#x201C;What are you all planning to do?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What are we planning to do? Your Sunset Cloud Valley and Three Stars Hall are willing to declare war against our Ying Heavenly Clan for a single Chu Feng. Right now, we are enemies. Yet, you&#x2019;re actually asking me what we plan to do?&#x201D; That Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder sneered. His tone was filled with mockery.</p><p>&#x201C;You are an elder, yet you&#x2019;re planning to bully us, people of the younger generation. Do you not feel that it is beneath your status?&#x201D; Xu Yiyi asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Little girl, the battlefield is a merciless place. Has your master not taught you that?&#x201D; As the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder said those words, the coldness in his eyes grew more and more intense. Killing intent actually emerged in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, while the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall have declared war against your Ying Heavenly Clan, we have not,&#x201D; A disciple who had been surrounded by individuals from the Ying Heavenly Clan walked forth and bowed with his hands held in front.</p><p>Following that person, all of the people present that were not disciples from the Three Stars Hall and the Sunset Cloud Valley hurriedly declared, &#x201C;Senior, this matter is unrelated to us. Please release us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, it is unrelated to you all. Go ahead and leave,&#x201D; The Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder waved his hand, and the disciples from other powers hurriedly left.</p><p>&#x201C;Although it is unrelated to them, it is related to you all,&#x201D; After that, that Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder turned his gaze containing killing intent at Xu Yiyi and the others.</p><p>At this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s disciples all felt a chill in their hearts. Merely from the gaze of that Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder, they were able to tell that he truly had the intention to kill them.</p><p>It would appear that a great catastrophe was truly imminent for them.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder, you&#x2019;ve also heard it earlier. That Chu Feng and I do not get along. While it is true that our Three Stars Hall has said that we will protect Chu Feng, that is only the desire of our headmaster. I am not in favor of that decision at all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, if you all are to kill me because of Chu Feng, my death&#x2026; would be too wrongful,&#x201D; Suddenly, Kou Kang stood out and spoke with an innocent expression on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Kou Kang, you&#x2026;&#x201D; Xu Yiyi was immediately furious upon hearing what Kou Kang said. Even Song Biyu&#x2019;s expression changed. They never expected Kou Kang to be such a spineless coward and actually beg their enemy for forgiveness.</p><p>&#x201C;Fellow martial brothers and sisters from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, do you not agree with what I said?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We have no association with that Chu Feng to begin with. Why must we throw our lives away for that Chu Feng?&#x201D; Kou Kang ignored Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu&#x2019;s gazes of contempt and turned to speak to the other disciples.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. What senior brother Kou Kang said is extremely correct. We should not die for that Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, we possess no relationship with that Chu Feng. Please spare us.&#x201D;</p><p>Once Kou Kang said those words, regardless of whether it was the Three Stars Hall or the Sunset Cloud Valley, a portion of their disciples immediately started to declare that they had no relation with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;You all&#x2026; you bunch of spineless cowards&#x2026;&#x201D; Faced with the begging of those disciples, Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu started to tremble with anger.</p><p>What those disciples were doing was not only begging for forgiveness, they were also disgracing their powers. Their actions were no different from desertion.</p><p>&#x201C;It is not that we are spineless. Rather, we merely do not wish to die in vain because of an unrelated individual,&#x201D; Kou Kang refuted. Then, he continued to speak to the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder, &#x201C;Senior, please see this matter clearly, and do not kill us, the innocent.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. Good. Our Ying Heavenly Clan are not a bunch of unreasonable people either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since you all have said it like this, I will spare you all. You all can go too,&#x201D; The Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder waved his hand again.</p><p>Although Kou Kang and the others&#x2019; actions were unavoidable since they wanted to survive, they were still met with hisses of contempt from many of the bystanders.</p><p>After all, no matter how one looked at it, their actions were simply craven and cowardly. They possessed no moral backbone at all.</p><p>However, Kou Kang and the others completely ignored the way the others viewed them. They acted as if they had managed to escape from the tiger&#x2019;s den, and quickly fled that place.</p><p>However, Kou Kang suddenly stopped when he was about to walk out from under the Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s besiegement. He turned around and sent a voice transmission to Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu, &#x201C;There is no reason for you all to throw your lives away because of Chu Feng. Come, leave with us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Scram!&#x201D; Xu Yiyi shouted coldly. Disgust filled the gaze with which she looked at Kou Kang.</p><p>In fact, even Kou Kang&#x2019;s fellow disciple Song Biyu looked at him with a gaze filled with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;The two of you are truly pigheaded. Your deaths are well-deserved,&#x201D; Ruthlessness appeared in Kou Kang&#x2019;s gaze. Then, he waved his sleeve and swaggered off.</p><p>However, he did not actually leave. Instead, he entered the crowd. He was actually planning to personally see Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu getting killed.</p><p>&#x201C;What is this? You all are truly willing to die for that Chu Feng?&#x201D; That Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder asked Xu Yiyi and the others.</p><p>After what happened earlier, he seemed to be more willing to see these disciples renouncing their relationship with Chu Feng.</p><p>After all, it would indirectly indicate that Chu Feng did not possess the support of the crowd.</p><p>&#x201C;We are willing to live and die together with our schools. If you wish to kill us, then go on and do it! Why bother with all these superfluous words!&#x201D; Xu Yiyi shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;We will live and die together with our schools. Go on and kill us!!!&#x201D; Following that, Song Biyu and the others disciples also shouted.</p><p>Their voices were like thunder and shook the heavens. They were prepared to die.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, since you all have decided, I will grant you all your wish,&#x201D; That Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder once again revealed killing intent in his eyes. As he spoke, he raised his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In an instant, surging winds covered the region as the sky darkened. His rank three Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might swept forth. It was as if doomsday were descending.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Yiyi and the others closed their eyes. They were prepared to accept death.</p><p>The reason for that was because it was simply impossible for them to survive before that oppressive might.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that you will not be able to kill them today.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when everyone felt that Xu Yiyi and the others would undoubtedly be killed, a voice sounded.</p><p>That voice came explosively like a thunderstrike, shocking the hearts of everyone.</p><p>Most shockingly, after that voice was heard, the crowd was surprised to discover the raised arm of that Ying Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s elder had actually frozen in midair. At the same time, his boundless oppressive might vanished completely.</p><p>To be exact, his oppressive might was forced back by an oppressive might even more powerful than his own.</p><p>Rank four Martial Ancestor. It was a rank four Martial Ancestor&#x2019;s oppressive might that saved Xu Yiyi and the others.</p><p>&#x2018;Could it be that reinforcements from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall have arrived?&#x2019;</p><p>That was what the crowd thought at this instant.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s him?&#x201D;</p><p>However, upon looking toward the direction of the voice, the crowd were tongue-tied and stunned. Disbelief filled their eyes.</p><p>A figure was slowly walking toward them from not far away. However, that person was not an elder or senior from the Sunset Cloud Valley or the Three Stars Hall.</p><p>Instead, he was a young man, someone much younger than majority of the younger generation present.</p><p>As for this man, he was none other than Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng? Isn&#x2019;t that Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens! How did he become this powerful? He&#x2019;s actually a rank four Martial Ancestor!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder, no wonder he was able to kill Ying Liangchen and Di Jiuzhou; Chu Feng was actually as powerful as he was rumored to be!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To possess a cultivation of rank four Martial Ancestor at such a young age, he is definitely an exceptional genius, most definitely! An exceptional genius has really appeared in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the surrounding crowd burst into an uproar. All they were saying were praises for Chu Feng.</p><p>It was not that they were trying to flatter him. Rather, at that moment, they were truly stunned by how powerful Chu Feng was.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
