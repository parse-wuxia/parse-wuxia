<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 925 - Confrontation</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Yue, don&#x2019;t get happy too soon. She isn&#x2019;t that easy to deal with,&#x201D; Wu Kunlun said, extinguishing his flames of excitement. He then asked, &#x201C;Senior Jiang, what plan to do you have? Why not tell us about it?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The witch&#x2019;s matter still requires long planning. Since there&#x2019;s still some time until the opening of the Heavenly Road, we just need to deal with her before then.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But first of all, there are some people visiting us right now. They even want us to give them a lesson!&#x201D; Jiang Qisha sneered at the enormous palace door. As he spoke, he waved his big sleeve and the shut doors opened with a bang.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Wu Kunlun and Zhao Yuetian instinctively knew something was going to happen. They orderly stood behind Jiang Qisha, and with an expressionless face they looked at the outside scenery.</span></p><p><span style="">As expected, after a moment, Murong Mingtian appeared. Moreover, behind him followed Murong Niekong, Murong Xun, the Second Immortal, and many other experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. They were walking over towards the palace in a grand manner.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, their current bearing was completely different from before, Murong Mingtian especially. Although he had a smile on his face, there was no longer any of his former obsequiousness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My friend Jiang Qisha, you&#x2019;ve returned! How was it? Have you gotten anything from the Road of Immortalization?&#x201D; Murong Mingtian said as he laughed after entering the palace.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Murong Mingtian, why ask when you already know? If I had truly gotten something within the Road of Immortalization, I&#x2019;m sure you wouldn&#x2019;t be laughing this happily, right?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But don&#x2019;t worry. Everything here is the Cursed Soil Sect&#x2019;s. I can take anything I want at any time. There is no rush.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You, on the other hand, shouldn&#x2019;t have come here just to give me those useless words, right?&#x201D; Jiang Qisha wore a light smile on his face. As he spoke, his tone was extremely fierce and didn&#x2019;t leave any face.</span></p><p><span style="">Many people&#x2019;s complexions from Immortal Execution Archipelago were very distorted, but no one dared to say anything. They just stood behind Murong Mingtian orderly.</span></p><p><span style="">They had basically all seen Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s techniques, and they had personally seen his killing strength and his ability to reverse the situation completely. They had seen him defeat Lady Piaomiao, and they knew the terror of this young man, a rank four Martial King. They didn&#x2019;t dare to easily offend him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, my friend Jiang Qisha, you truly are smart. I also enjoy dealing with intelligent people.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I have come here today for no other reason but because I want to take Zi Ling away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No matter what crime she committed, she is, after all, my Murong family&#x2019;s fianc&#xE9;e. It is not too appropriate that she is subjected to imprisonment here.&#x201D; As Murong Mingtian spoke, he cast his gaze towards Zi Ling.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, Murong Xun&#x2019;s gaze was also cast towards Zi Ling, his so-called fianc&#xE9;e. Moreover, his pair of eyes were restlessly examining Zi Ling&#x2019;s perfect body.</span></p><p><span style="">He already knew the lovers&#x2019; relationship between Chu Feng and Zi Ling. So, from his vicious and concealed lecherous gaze, one could see how he planned to take revenge.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m not going with you! I&#x2019;m not a part of your Murong family. I am Chu Feng&#x2019;s fianc&#xE9;e,&#x201D; Zi Ling loudly said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heh, that&#x2019;s not up to you.&#x201D; Murong Mingtian sneered, then held out his palm. A burst of powerful suction power then surged out towards Zi Ling. He wanted to destroy the cage that locked Zi Ling.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* However, before the power even neared, a ripple appeared. It soundlessly dissipated Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s attack.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jiang Qisha, what are you doing?&#x201D; Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s expression did not change as he looked at Jiang Qisha. He knew he was the one who did that.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Murong Mingtian, it&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m not giving you this face, but my junior Kuang Bainian is now in the hands of others. That person clearly said nothing can happen to Zi Ling, so thus I must guarantee her safety. It would be better that you leave.&#x201D; Jiang Qisha very casually waved his hand. He was driving them away.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Zi Ling is my Murong family&#x2019;s fianc&#xE9;e. How could I possibly wish to harm her?&#x201D; Murong Mingtian cunningly argued.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That may not be so,&#x201D; Jiang Qisha indifferently said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jiang Qisha, does this mean you don&#x2019;t trust me?&#x201D; Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s expression was a bit unsightly.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I have never trusted you from the very beginning.&#x201D; Jiang Qisha stood up. He stared at Murong Mingtian with his fierce gaze, and spoke very gravely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jiang Qisha, let me advise you: don&#x2019;t go too far. I tolerate you again and again only because of my respect towards you as an ally. Don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m afraid of you,&#x201D; Murong Mingtian furiously shouted as he pointed at Jiang Qisha.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ally? Actually, I forgot to tell you. In my eyes, you are no allies to me. You are mere dogs. Do I have to respect a group of dogs?&#x201D; Jiang Qisha roared with laughter&#x2014;it was a very ridiculing laughter.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Jiang Qisha, you&#x2019;ve gone too far!&#x201D; Murong Mingtian was finally enraged. He flipped his wrist, and put into his hand a Royal Armament that shone with light. He was already powerful as a rank seven Martial King, and in addition to a ruler&#x2019;s bearing from the Royal Armament, the might he now possessed was enough to frighten the world. He was simply unstoppable.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, layers upon layers of boundless aura because an uncontrollable hurricane, endlessly surging outward from Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">It made the entire palace shake. The countless number of little items decorating the palace started to slide and break. If the palace weren&#x2019;t from the Ancient Era thus giving it its extreme firmness, it would have likely been shattered already by such a powerful might.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hoh.&#x201D; However, even though Murong Mingtian looked so powerful, Jiang Qisha was not afraid in the slightest. He sneered, then flipped his palm. A fiery-red halberd appeared within his hand.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* What came immediately after its appearance was the release of an extremely horrifying aura. In just an instant, it enveloped the entire palace, and even submerged Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s powerful aura beneath it.</span></p><p><span style="">At that very instant, everyone in the palace, other than Jiang Qisha and the others, could feel enormous power. An indescribable pressure pushed onto them, making it difficult to breathe.</span></p><p><span style="">Even the Royal Armament in Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s hand was slightly trembling. It, as a Royal Armament, was actually afraid.</span></p><p><span style="">Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s expression paled instantly. He once again carefully examined the fiery-red halberd in Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s hand, and the longer he looked, the stronger the fear became in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">In the end, with the slight wave of his robe, he put away his Royal Armament. At the same time, he also put away his pressure of a rank seven Martial King, and said with a face of shame, &#x201C;My friend Jiang Qisha, I&#x2019;ve been rash just know. Please don&#x2019;t take offense.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Before the confrontation even officially started, Murong Mingtian had already admitted defeat.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
