<p><strong> Chapter 2164 - Gazes Of Despise</strong></p><p>Following Tang Ying, Chu Feng soon arrived at the sleeping chambers of the Tang Family&#x2019;s Family Head.</p><p>Several figures were gathered in the sleeping chambers of the Tang Family&#x2019;s Family Head. Among them was Tang Ying&#x2019;s third brother, Tang Yong.</p><p>There were two other men. Those two men were much older than Tang Yong. The oldest among them was actually over five thousand years old.</p><p>&#x201C;Little sister, why would you be here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t father order that you were not allowed to enter this place?&#x201D;</p><p>After seeing Tang Ying and Chu Feng, not only did that Tang Yong walk toward them and address Tang Ying as &#x2018;little sister&#x2019;, the two other men also walked toward them and addressed Tang Ying as &#x2018;little sister&#x2019; as well.</p><p>Chu Feng was surprised by this scene. He had truly never expected Tang Ying&#x2019;s older brothers to be this old. Judging by this, Tang Ying&#x2019;s oldest brother was over five thousands years older than her.</p><p>An age gap this enormous would simply be impossible to be spoken of as siblings in a small power. Instead, it should be the relationship of one&#x2019;s ancestor and one&#x2019;s descendant.</p><p>For example, the founder of the Azure Dragon School, the Azure Dragon Founder, was only over a thousand years old. Furthermore, if it wasn&#x2019;t for the treasures left behind by Qing Xuantian, he would not have been able to survive for over a millennium. After all, his cultivation was very weak.</p><p>However, Tang Ying&#x2019;s three older brothers had all been able to live for at least ten thousand years or longer. The reason for that was because they were all Half Martial Ancestor-level experts.</p><p>This was the disparity between cultivation realms. Not only would one&#x2019;s cultivation increase one&#x2019;s strength, it would strengthen all aspects of oneself.</p><p>As for Tang Ying&#x2019;s oldest brother, he was a rank six Half Martial Ancestor. He possessed the strongest strength among the Tang Family siblings.</p><p>Although he was over five thousand years old, when compared to the experts in the Holy Land of Martialism, he would be seen as extremely amazing to have been able to obtain his current level of cultivation in a mere five thousand years. In fact, he could be considered to be a martial cultivation genius.</p><p>However, Chu Feng felt that he would not be considered to be a genius in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. At the very most, he would be considered to be gifted.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had heard from his father that only people that possessed extraordinary heaven-defying battle power would be considered geniuses in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. An example of such would be the Heavenly Clans.</p><p>&#x201C;Eldest brother, second brother, third brother, this is Chu Feng. He is the one that killed the Ghostfiend Beast.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not only does Chu Feng possessed overwhelming strength, he is also a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. He said that he wished to help treat father&#x2019;s injury,&#x201D; Tang Ying hurriedly said.</p><p>Tang Ying&#x2019;s oldest brother used his deep gaze to size up Chu Feng. Then, he revealed a light smile, and said with a tone that was neither servile nor overbearing, &#x201C;Nice to meet you, Brother Chu Feng. I am Tang Ying&#x2019;s oldest brother, Tang Long.&#x201D; One could tell that he was a person of experience.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, I am Tang Ying&#x2019;s second brother, Tang Hu. I have heard of you from my third brother.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Those two were truly insensible. I hope that you do not take their offense to heart.&#x201D;</p><p>Tang Ying&#x2019;s second brother also walked toward Chu Feng to speak to him. Compared to Tang Ying&#x2019;s oldest brother, her second brother was much more enthusiastic and polite. By the same manner, he also appeared to be more fake.</p><p>Although Chu Feng was young, he had experienced a lot. Thus, his sense of perception was very strong. He was generally capable of distinguishing whether people were treating him with sincerity or putting on an act.</p><p>As for Tang Ying&#x2019;s oldest brother and second brother, it was evident that they were not welcoming Chu Feng with sincerity.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to mention things that happened in the past anymore. May I have a look at the Tang Family&#x2019;s Family Head?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, are you really a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, an old man with long blonde hair who was wearing a Royal Cloak World Spiritist Cloak slowly walked out from within the depths of the sleeping chamber.</p><p>That old man&#x2019;s cultivation was not very strong; he was only a rank one Half Martial Ancestor. However, he was extremely old. He was likely over ten thousand years old.</p><p>At his age, his face should be filled with wrinkles and aged spots. However, he had no such thing.</p><p>Not only did his face have no wrinkles or age spots, it was also extremely rosy, comparable to an infant&#x2019;s skin. In fact, his entire body was glimmering. It was as if he was a living Immortal.</p><p>Without having others mention it, Chu Feng knew that he must be that Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist Tang Ying had spoken of, that so-called Grandmaster Kangping.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandmaster Kangping, Chu Feng is truly a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,&#x201D; Tang Ying said.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, my little sister and our Tang Family&#x2019;s many guards have all experienced Brother Chu Feng&#x2019;s abilities,&#x201D; Tang Yong added.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; However, that Grandmaster Kangping began to size up Chu Feng with a gaze of disbelief.</p><p>Sure enough, it was as Tang Ying had said, this Grandmaster Kangping was extremely conceited. Although his cultivation was only that of a rank one Half Martial Ancestor, there was a dense amount of disdain in the gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng.</p><p>Seeing that the attitude of that Grandmaster Kangping was not good, Chu Feng did not face him with a smile either. Instead, he coldly said, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s this? Do I need you to inspect and verify whether or not I&#x2019;m a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, there&#x2019;s no need for that. Merely, little friend, this old man has trained in world spirit techniques for no less than ten thousand years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since I began to train in world spirit techniques, I have meticulously studied healing techniques. That is the reason why I ended up delaying my martial cultivation. Else, it would be impossible for me to only be a rank one Half Martial Ancestor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, my painstaking efforts were not in vain. Right now, no one in the territory governed by Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion does not know about me, Kangping.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While I do not dare to boast about anything else, I dare say that I, Kangping, am second to none in terms of healing others.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The injury to the Tang Family&#x2019;s Family Head is too serious. It is not that I cannot heal him. Rather, it is that I am unable to completely heal him within a month&#x2019;s time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When even I am unable to cure him, little friend, are you really certain that you want to attempt to cure him?&#x201D; Grandmaster Kangping said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Just because it&#x2019;s an injury that you cannot cure, does that mean that others cannot cure it too?&#x201D; Chu Feng refuted.</p><p>Once Chu Feng said those words, the expression of that Grandmaster Kangping changed. A displeased expression appeared in his gaze.</p><p>However, he did not reveal his displeasure. Instead, he smiled and said, &#x201C;If little friend wishes to attempt it, I will naturally not stop you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely&#x2026;&#x201D; Grandmaster Kangping looked to the Tang Family&#x2019;s four siblings, &#x201C;your father&#x2019;s injury is very serious. It has already injured his soul. I was only able to stabilize his injury through a spirit formation I&#x2019;ve formed with meticulous effort. Although I am unable to cure him within a month&#x2019;s time, it remains that I have preserved his life.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if someone decides to take their own initiative and destroy what I have set up, your father might end up losing his life in the process.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At that time, I will not take responsibility for it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Tang Long, Tang Hu and Tang Yong all revealed difficult expressions. As it concerned their father&#x2019;s life, they would naturally not dare to act recklessly.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, we thank you for your kind intentions.&#x201D;</p><p>After hesitating for some time, Tang Long said to Chu Feng with a smile, &#x201C;It is not that we are looking down on you. Merely, Grandmaster Kangping is truly someone who has great knowledge of healing techniques. Thus&#x2026; I think it is better to listen to him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In merely two hours, I will be able to completely cure your father. If I am unable to accomplish that, you all can do as you wish to my life,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you saying? There&#x2019;s no need for you to risk your life like this, no?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Tang Ying was extremely shocked. She hurriedly moved toward Chu Feng and advised him against it. After all, she did not wish for Chu Feng to lose his life because of her family matters.</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, I possess certainty of success,&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly patted Tang Ying&#x2019;s hand that was grabbing him. He was indicating to her to not worry.</p><p>&#x201C;...&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng acting this confident, Tang Long and his brothers also revealed surprised expressions.</p><p>However, compared to Tang Yong, Tang Long and Tang Hu&#x2019;s gazes contained a bit of doubt.</p><p>The two of them did not know much about Chu Feng, nor had they seen his abilities. Thus, they were uncertain as to whether Chu Feng was truly capable or whether he was boasting.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
