<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 935 - Rank Seven Martial Lord</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Master&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng was shocked. He knew he had to lay hold of the Demon Sealing Sword and command the Crippling Night Demon Sect if he wanted to save Zi Ling.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in reality, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t want to become the head of some demon sect. Even if he pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword, he felt he was unqualified. On the other hand, no matter experience or strength, his master was fully suited for that position. Moreover, Chu Feng knew Qiu Canfeng did really want this role.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet, right now, even Qiu Canfeng wanted Chu Feng to become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. That truly put him in a difficult position, because he knew Qiu Canfeng wasn&#x2019;t joking.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, listen to me first. Before he passed away, the sect head had said no matter who it was, as long as they were able to pull out the Demon Sealing Sword, they could become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Similarly, the only person qualified as head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect is the person who is able to wield the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Although I do wish to command the Crippling Night Demon Sect, I do not have the ability to pull it out. Even if I can subdue everyone with my strength, it will only be a submission of mouth, not of heart. That would instead be worse.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But you are different. You&#x2019;re able to pull the Demon Sealing Sword out, so you are the sole person qualified to rule the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve seen it too. Right now, the Crippling Night Demon Sect is in pieces. We&#x2019;re already no match for the Immortal Execution Archipelago, and the Immortal Execution Archipelago will sooner or later destroy us completely if the present circumstances persist.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If we rebuild the Crippling Night Demon Sect right now, perhaps we can put up a battle against them. Any later, when we wait until the Immortal Execution Archipelago comes to deal with us themselves, it will be all too late,&#x201D; Qiu Canfeng urged when Chu Feng hesitated.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, a master&#x2019;s order is hard to turn down. Just accept. Besides, even if you become sect head, you don&#x2019;t have to stay in the Eastern Sea Region. When you want to venture off to the Holy Land of Martialism, wouldn&#x2019;t it be fine to just have your master handle the Crippling Night Demon Sect?&#x201D; Taikou urged as well.</span></p><p><span style="">The meaning behind his words was very simple: Chu Feng just had to wear the title of &#x201C;sect head&#x201D; while the person who truly controlled the Crippling Night Demon Sect remained to be Qiu Canfeng. And, Qiu Canfeng could only fairly and reasonably rule over the Crippling Night Demon Sect when Chu Feng became the sect head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then&#x2026; fine. Master, I will follow your instructions.&#x201D; With this much persuading from his master and Taikou, Chu Feng naturally couldn&#x2019;t refuse. Thus, he could only agree to their suggestions.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm, that&#x2019;s how it should be.&#x201D; Qiu Canfeng satisfiedly smiled after Chu Feng accepted. As he spoke, he handed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;This is what I promised you before. Although it&#x2019;s less than Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s Pearl of Immortal Inheritance, it will more or less help you. Your chances of victory when facing that brat from the Holy Land of Martialism will also increase a bit.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Thank you, Master.&#x201D; Chu Feng could not hide his grin when he received the Cosmos Sack. It was filled with cultivation resources, and they were not even ordinary cultivation resources. The amount was so staggering it made one dumbfounded.</span></p><p><span style="">These resources were very special. To a normal person, it would prove greatly difficult if they wanted to refine them. There were even some things in there that normal people simply could not refine, yet Chu Feng could, even within a short period of time.</span></p><p><span style="">If he refined so many cultivation resources, he would not merely become a rank six Martial Lord. Perhaps Chu Feng could make continuous breakthroughs and become a rank seven Martial Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, other than large amounts of cultivation resources, Chu Feng also discovered something that made him excited within the Cosmos Sack&#x2014;it was a Spirit Formation. A mystical creature was sealed within the Spirit Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">It seemed like a peacock, but it was something more beautiful, more overbearing, and more ferocious.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a vermilion bird. Very evidently, this was the final Secret Skill that lay within the Imperial Tomb&#x2014;the Vermilion Bird Revival Technique.</span></p><p><span style="">The White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, Black Tortoise Armour Technique, and Azure Dragon Dashing Technique had been obtained. What remained was only the Vermilion Bird Revival Technique.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng had a premonition that these four Secret Skills were connected. Only after successfully cultivating all of them could their true power be used. Chu Feng had awaited this day for a very long time. Finally, it had come.</span></p><p><span style="">After meeting up with Lady Piaomiao and the others, they didn&#x2019;t leave immediately because Chu Feng prepared to restart their journey only after refining the cultivation resources and cultivating the Vermilion Bird Revival Technique.</span></p><p><span style="">After all, Chu Feng had an important mission this time by returning to the Eastern Sea Region. No matter becoming the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, or attacking the Misty Peak, he required even more powerful strength. He had to first raise his power.</span></p><p><span style="">He went to work immediately. On the day they reunited, he found a peaceful area, went in seclusion, and started refining the resources he received from Qiu Canfeng.</span></p><p><span style="">There were many resources, and they were very special as well. Thus, they were very difficult to refine. However, to Chu Feng, it was a very simple task, even simpler than eating and drinking. As a result, after less than half a day, Chu Feng had finished.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, as Chu Feng expected, he had truly made continuous breakthroughs in cultivation after refining all of those resources&#x2014;from rank five Martial Lord, he became a rank seven Martial Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">Back then, Chu Feng was relying on the power of the Divine Lightning to become a rank five Martial Lord. So, he himself didn&#x2019;t really know the immensity of cultivation resources required to make a breakthrough.</span></p><p><span style="">However, he knew it was definitely a horrifying amount. When he truly became a rank seven Martial Lord after refining all of those cultivation resources, Chu Feng felt surprised, and excited.</span></p><p><span style="">He could feel that he was now not only just a rank seven Martial Lord&#x2014;there was still extremely strong power that accumulated within his dantian. Right now, he was likely at the peak of rank seven Martial Lord. He was only a step away from being a rank eight Martial Lord.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng had to admit that the cultivation resources within the Imperial Tomb were indeed extraordinary. They even surpassed his imagination.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, how impressive! Chu Feng, do you see this? This is your strength. As long as you have sufficient cultivation resources, your rate of cultivation improvement is absolutely terrifying! In this world, I doubt there&#x2019;s anyone who can compare to you.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The amount of cultivation resources in the Eastern Sea Region is limited. However, when you reach the Holy Land of Martialism in the future, the cultivation resources at that place will definitely be abundant. After all, that&#x2019;s a place with Martial Emperors.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;At that place, although experts are as common as clouds, you are a person who becomes strong when you meet a strong person. You will be like a fish in water. Right now, you are a rank seven Martial Lord, and you&#x2019;re just a step away from being a rank eight Martial Lord. But I can already see the day that you become a Martial King.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No, your cultivation will not just be limited to Martial King&#x2014;Martial Emperor. Sooner or later, you will become a Martial Emperor. It&#x2019;s not even an impossibility that you become an existence that surpasses Martial Emperors!&#x201D; Eggy was actually even more excited than Chu Feng when she felt his present cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="">On his journey of cultivation, Eggy had experienced the very same troubles Chu Feng had faced. She had personally watched as Chu Feng, from a little outer sect disciple of the Azure Dragon School, a trash with cultivation in the Spirit realm, slowly develop to his present state. She knew Chu Feng hadn&#x2019;t done this easily, but at the same time, she knew how huge of a potential was concealed within Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">She looked very forward, with Chu Feng, to stepping onto a stage much vaster, and stepping onto a journey much more perilous.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
