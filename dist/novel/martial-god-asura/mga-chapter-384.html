<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 384 - There&apos;s Something Hidden</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Looking at the martial skill in his hand, Chu Feng hesitated a bit because before, they already came to an agreement that martial skills belonged to Zi Ling, and Profound medicines belonged to him. No matter what, the martial skill should be given to Zi Ling.</span></p><p><span style="">However, after all, it was a rank 9 martial skill. It was a martial skill that no one cultivated before in the continent of the Nine Provinces. Giving a martial skill like that to another person truly ached Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, give this rank 9 martial skill to her.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As long as you give the martial skill to her, perhaps you can capture her heart in this instant, and perhaps this girl will love you because of this.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It is only an insignificant rank 9 martial skill. How can that be compared to the benefits a Divine Body brings you? Is there even a need to hesitate?&#x201D; But as Chu Feng hesitated, Eggy&#x2019;s voice of reminder rang out next to his ear.</span></p><p><span style="">With Eggy&#x2019;s reminder, Chu Feng gnashed his teeth, and when Zi Ling was caught off guard, he threw his hand out with lightning-like speed and patted the rank 9 martial skill in his hand onto Zi Ling&#x2019;s head.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm*</span></p><p><span style="">In the instant the rank 9 martial skill touched Zi Ling&#x2019;s head, it became a strand of light and burrowed into Zi Ling brain, and disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, you..&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Facing Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions, Zi Ling&#x2019;s face was filled with shock. Her eyes were roundly widened and her little mouth also slightly opened.</span></p><p><span style="">Because, no matter what, she never would have thought that Chu Feng would actually give the rank 9 martial skill over to her. To know that it wasn&#x2019;t a normal martial skill, but a rank 9 martial skill!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I already made a promise and said that martial skills are yours. So this is yours.&#x201D; Chu Feng chuckled and said, showing a face of indifference.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing Chu Feng who was so calm, Zi Ling&#x2019;s heart rapidly changed and there was an unspeakable feeling. So, she said in a low voice, &#x201C;Chu Feng, thank you.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What is there to thank about? That&#x2019;s right, is this martial skill really a rank 9 martial skill?&#x201D; Chu Feng unconcernedly waved his hand, but after that, he still curiously asked closely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm. It&#x2019;s a rank 9 martial skill and it is extremely impressive. It seems like the master here is an extremely high-level expert.&#x201D; Zi Ling nodded her head.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah. If the consciousness that he left behind was so strong, then wouldn&#x2019;t he himself be even more outstanding?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, the remains here are clearly a bit old. If that Gold-cloak World Spiritist is truly the master here, then hasn&#x2019;t he lived for many years? What realm would the current him be in?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Although this place hasn&#x2019;t existed as long as a thousand years, it has definitely existed several hundred years. If he was a Martial Lord who stepped into the peak level, then it isn&#x2019;t impossible for him to have a life of several hundred years. If he was in the Martial King realm, then there is no need to even talk about it. Besides, he&#x2019;s a World Spiritist, so his life would always be longer than normal people.&#x201D; Zi Ling explained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Mm.&#x201D; After hearing those words, Chu Feng also nodded his head in approval, but he discovered that the things Zi Ling knew didn&#x2019;t seem to be any less than what he knew, perhaps she even knew more than him. At least, in terms of martial cultivation realms, she knew them in more detail than Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">*rumble rumble rumble*</span></p><p><span style="">But just at that time, the rock stage in the middle of the stage suddenly rumbled and the seven-coloured light that was projected from the upper part of the palace also quickly faded away. At the end, the palace that stored the rank 9 martial skill disappeared, and the ceiling made out of rocks returned.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the rumbling of the rock stage did not disappear like that. Instead, they became louder and louder, and following the rumbling sounds, the rock stage had actually gradually sank down.</span></p><p><span style="">After that rock stage went down, Chu Feng and Zi Ling astonishedly discovered that it was a passageway. Although the passageway was very small, it was indeed a passageway.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s something hidden?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng rejoiced. First, he used his Spirit power to explore it for a while, then after discovering that there were no dangers, he walked down first. Zi Ling also closely followed him.</span></p><p><span style="">Going along the passageway for roughly a thousand meters, there was a transparent door that appeared in front. The Spirit Formation door was transparent and they could see everything on the other side of the door.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This&#x2026; This is?&#x201D; And after Chu Feng and Zi Ling saw everything on the other side of the Spirit Formation door, the two of them were both shocked.</span></p><p><span style="">This was similarly a palace, and the palace was exactly the same as the one Chu Feng and Zi Ling were in before.</span></p><p><span style="">However, in the middle of the palace, there was a circular rock stage. That rock stage was very big and its diameter was a hundred meters. It seemed like a mini plaza, and as it fluctuating up and down and while floating in the air of the vast palace, it seemed abnormally magical.</span></p><p><span style="">But that wasn&#x2019;t the important part. The important part was at that instant, on the rock stage, it was emitting a bundle of light that enveloped downwards.</span></p><p><span style="">Within that light, there were eighty-eight people sitting cross-leggedly on the floor. Those eighty-eight people were the apical experts sent by the eight-sided powers.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the current them did not have good faces. Palms overlaid, trembling bodies, and they were currently using their Heaven power to resist something.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Suddenly, an old person in the 1st level of the Heaven realm abruptly quivered violently and a mouthful of blood sprayed out. After powerlessly laying on the ground, he started to painfully struggle and miserably yell.</span></p><p><span style="">As he struggled, his body had actually started to twist and from his body, crackling noises kept on ringing out, as if the bones in his entire body were shattering. At the same time, his physical body also started to change and at the end, he became a pool of blood.</span></p><p><span style="">Seeing that scene, Chu Feng and Zi Ling stared at one another with their four eyes and the two of them couldn&#x2019;t help but take in a breath of cool air. To be able to forcefully turn an expert in the 1st level of the Heaven realm into a pool of blood. What kind of terrifying power was it?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit. We were set up. There wasn&#x2019;t any treasure in this place and it was only an Illusionary Formation. We were tricked.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Looking at that scene, a middle-aged man wearing a fiery-red-coloured long robe furiously roared. He was an expert of the 5th level of the Heaven realm, the head of the Fire God Valley.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fire God Valley head, if it wasn&#x2019;t for you who was too impatient and flew over quickly after seeing the treasure, we wouldn&#x2019;t have followed you and also step into this Illusionary Formation, causing us, at this very moment, to be trapped in this formation and unable to escape.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">A man with black hair as well as eyebrows like swords coldly snorted. And that person also had the cultivation of the 5th level of the Heaven realm. He was the head of the Sword God Valley.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Rubbish. If all of you didn&#x2019;t also have a selfish heart, why also follow me and intrude into this place?&#x201D; The head of the Fire God Valley yelled.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All of you, shut up! The power of this formation is so strong, yet none of you concentrate on resisting against it. Do you have the leisure to waste strength on battling with mouths? Do all of you want to die in this place?&#x201D; Suddenly, an old man with greying hair on both sides of his temples angrily yelled.</span></p><p><span style="">That old man wore a blue World Spirit Cloak. Although he was also in the 5th level of the Heaven realm, his aura was extremely thick and on his clothes, there was even a badge. It was the badge of the World Spirit Guild. He was the vice head of the World Spirit Guild.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, as expected of a World Spiritist! You actually still know to conserve your power to fight against the pressure of the formation.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But sadly, this formation is not something that any of you can resist against. Not to mention you, even if the old ancestor of the Jiang Dynasty comes, he will have trouble stepping out of the formation and he would be fated to be refined into a pool of blood.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
