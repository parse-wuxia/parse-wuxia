<p><strong> Chapter 2426 - The First Manifestation Of Might</strong></p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s actually such a powerful Demon Armament in this world? This is simply many times more powerful than even Ancestral Armaments. Chu Feng is actually able to use such a powerful Demon Armament?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng&#x2026; exactly what is his origin?&#x201D;</p><p>As the crowd praised in admiration, they began to ponder Chu Feng&#x2019;s origin again.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you alright?&#x201D;</p><p>Compared to the overwhelming might emitted by the Evil God Sword, Her Lady Queen was more concerned about Chu Feng&#x2019;s safety.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had officially unleashed the power of the Evil God Sword.</p><p>&#x201C;For the time being, this sword has yet to go out of control. It has given its power to me, allowing me to use it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I now have a rough sensation of its power. If my guess is correct, I will be able to contend against True Immortals as long as I have it,&#x201D; Chu Feng grew excited.</p><p>&#x201C;Really? Then quickly activate your Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings to increase your cultivation so that you can kill those Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s old farts,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;No. right now, I have only obtained the strength of the Evil God Sword, and my cultivation isn&#x2019;t really at the True Immortal realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, not only am I unable to use the Heavenly Bloodline&#x2019;s power, I am also unable to use my martial power to unleash my martial skills and secret skills.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, Chu Feng looked at the Evil God Sword he held in his hands, he said, &#x201C;Right now, this sword is the only thing that I can use.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Evil God Sword is the only thing you can use?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen revealed an astonished expression.</p><p>&#x201C;However, I feel... that this sword by itself is sufficient.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, Chu Feng pointed the Evil God Sword in his hand toward one of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, a strange and ear-piercing voice sounded. Then, a crimson sword ray was shot directly toward that Utmost Exalted Elder.</p><p>&#x201C;This aura, damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>Faced with the sword ray unleashed by the Evil God Sword, that Utmost Exalted Elder revealed a panic-stricken expression. He simply did not even dare to block the attack. Rather, he immediately moved aside to dodge it.</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not give up just like that. He continued to brandish his Evil God Sword, and unleashed several sword rays toward that Utmost Exalted Elder.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn!&#x201D;</p><p>In Such a situation, that Utmost Exalted Elder could only try to dodge continuously.</p><p>It was not that he did not want to fight back. Rather, Chu Feng&#x2019;s attacks were simply too fast.</p><p>Furthermore, it wasn&#x2019;t that he didn&#x2019;t want to block the attacks. Rather, the crimson sword rays emitted by the Evil God Sword were simply too frightening.</p><p>Those sword rays brought that Utmost Exalted Elder a sensation, that... he was simply unable to block them.</p><p>Thus, he naturally did not dare to block them.</p><p>In merely a blink of an eye, that Utmost Exalted Elder was forced many thousands of meters away by Chu Feng.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he did not continue to chase after that Utmost Exalted Elder. Rather, he arrived beside Kong Shunlian.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, that sword of yours!!!&#x201D; Kong Shunlian was also astonished by Chu Feng&#x2019;s Evil God Sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Kong, I will tell you about the origins of this sword in detail in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, we must get through this crisis first. As you&#x2019;re already injured, you should not battle anymore. Leave with Wang Qiang first, I&#x2019;ll handle them,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Kong Shunlian revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>However, Chu Feng completely disregarded Kong Shunlian&#x2019;s expression.</p><p>Instead, Chu Feng looked at the mysterious individual and said, &#x201C;Senior, I do not know who you are. However, this Chu Feng is truly thankful that you have placed your life on the line to come to my assistance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Might you be willing to leave me your distinguished name? If this Chu Feng is able to live past today, I will definitely repay senior&#x2019;s kindness today.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Young Master Chu Feng, this old man is your servant,&#x201D; That mysterious individual said.</p><p>&#x201C;Servant?&#x201D; The response from that mysterious individual came like a sudden clap of thunder in the hearts of all the crowd present.</p><p>&#x201C;Servant? That unknown True Immortal actually declared himself to be Chu Feng&#x2019;s servant?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens, a True Immortal-level expert is actually Chu Feng&#x2019;s servant?! Sure enough, Chu Feng possesses an extraordinary origin, a truly extraordinary origin!&#x201D;</p><p>The word &#x2018;servant&#x2019; was caught by Zhuge Mingren. He immediately cried out in alarm.</p><p>Once he muttered those words, the rest of the bystanders all heard it too.</p><p>&#x201C;True Immortal servant?! Chu Feng&#x2019;s servant is a True Immortal?! Heavens! Chu Feng not only possesses such a powerful Demon Armament, what sort of huge monster does Chu Feng have behind his back too?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He is most definitely not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He must be a Young Master from a certain Upper Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2026; oh Kong Heavenly Clan, you all have truly met your match now, no?&#x201D;</p><p>Upon finding out the matter of that True Immortal being Chu Feng&#x2019;s servant, the crowd was completely astonished. However, they all burst into laughter too.</p><p>They were all people standing on Chu Feng&#x2019;s side. Thus, to them, this news was extremely great.</p><p>At that moment, they were all certain that Chu Feng was not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Although there were indeed some hidden True Immortal-level experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they were all proud and arrogant individuals, and would definitely refuse to submit to others as servants.</p><p>Thus, merely from one word from that mysterious True Immortal, the crowd was certain that Chu Feng must be someone from an Upper Realm.</p><p>As for the Upper Realms&#x2019; huge monsters, how could a mere Kong Heavenly Clan possibly contend against them?</p><p>At that moment, everyone felt that the Kong Heavenly Clan had kicked an iron plate, that they would definitely suffer enormously in the future.</p><p>In fact, even the destruction of their Kong Heavenly Clan was possible.</p><p>&#x201C;Servant?&#x201D;</p><p>In fact, Chu Feng was also very astonished right now. No matter how hard he thought about it, he was unable to think of a True Immortal-level servant.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, regardless of who you might be, I still thank you for your grace today. However, what happened here today is caused by me, Chu Feng. As such, I truly do not wish to implicate you. Thus&#x2026; please leave too. You can leave the rest to me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Kong Shunlian&#x2019;s expression grew increasingly shocked. He simply did not dare to believe his own ears.</p><p>Chu Feng was actually planning to take on three True Immortals by himself?</p><p>&#x201C;What shameless boasting. Do you really think that you can contend against True Immortals with a mere weapon?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will let you experience exactly how powerful the might of a True Immortal is right now.&#x201D;</p><p>The remaining Utmost Exalted Elder who was fighting against Kong Shunlian grew extremely furious and rushed to attack Chu Feng.</p><p>He brandished the Ancestral Armament he held in his hand and shot a slash toward Chu Feng.</p><p>That slash was no ordinary attack. Rather, it was a martial skill, an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.</p><p>A True Immortal unleashing an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill with an Ancestral Armament, oh how powerful must that be?</p><p>It was so frighteningly powerful that even Kong Shunlian, a fellow True Immortal, would not dare be careless toward it. Kong Shunlian raised his Ancestral Armament with the intention of blocking that attack.</p><p>However, right at the moment when Kong Shunlian was about to act, Chu Feng suddenly thrust forth his Evil God Sword.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A crimson sword ray was once again shot forth from Chu Feng&#x2019;s Evil God Sword.</p><p>The very next moment, the crimson sword ray collided with the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill unleashed by the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder.</p><p>To the crowd&#x2019;s astonishment, the collision did not end in a loud explosion, nor did it create energy ripples wreaking havoc through the surroundings.</p><p>Instead, like a stream assimilating into the sea, it quietly and completely disappeared.</p><p>That&#x2019;s right, it was like a stream assimilating into the sea.</p><p>That Utmost Exalted Elder&#x2019;s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was devoured, devoured by the Evil God Sword&#x2019;s sword ray.</p><p>At that moment, not only did that crimson sword ray not grow weaker, it instead became more powerful than before.</p><p>That scene stunned everyone present.</p><p>One should know&#x2026; that the people involved, with the exception of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, were all True Immortals.</p><p>When even True Immortals were stunned, one could tell how astonishing what had just happened was.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
