<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1224 - Her Lady Queen</strong></p><p>What the two Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits released were their powerful energies.</p><p>Golden light shone as the abundant fairy energy engulfed Bai Ruochen. However, even with this, they were incapable of releasing her at all.</p><p>It was so much so that regardless of how powerful they were, they were incapable of seizing that oppressive might that was repressing Bai Ruochen. There was no need to even mention contending against that oppressive might.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s useless. This is a spirit formation set up by a royal-cloak world spiritist. Only royal-cloak world spiritists are capable of breaking it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would seem that the Nine Spirits God had already anticipated that someone would come to take these source energies. That&#x2019;s why he had set up this formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He had deliberately made the protection screen outside that easy because such a valiant formation was waiting for us inside.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sure enough, there&#x2019;s no free lunch in this world. If we want to obtain gains, we will have to pay the price,&#x201D; Chu Feng spoke. Even though the situation was desperate, he was not worried in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what should we do then?&#x201D; Bai Ruochen started to panic a bit because this formation was simply too powerful.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very simple. Those source energies are for the world spirits. In that case, let&#x2019;s just have our world spirits go and absorb them. However, whether or not they&#x2019;ll be able to pass through that world spirit gate will be up to the world spirits themselves.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To put it in simpler terms, that world spirit gate is a trial. If the world spirits are not qualified, they won&#x2019;t be able to pass through it. However, if a world spirit is able to pass through it, then the source energies inside would be all theirs to absorb.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng spoke, a world spirit gate appeared before him.</p><p>At this moment, not only Bai Ruochen, even those two Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits turned their gazes toward Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit gate.</p><p>With how powerful Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques were, they all wished to know exactly what sort of world spirit had made a contract with him to become his world spirit.</p><p>Before the attentive gazes of the three individuals, the queen who wore a black miniskirt gracefully extended her beautiful long legs and walked out of Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit gate.</p><p>&#x201C;This is?&#x201D; When they saw Her Lady Queen, the expressions of Bai Ruochen and the two Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits all changed. Immediately after, disappointment emerged on their faces.</p><p>That was because Eggy was not emitting her distinct asura energy. However, she was emitting an aura of darkness.</p><p>In other worlds, no matter how beautiful and harmless Eggy might seem, upon close inspection, she gave off the feeling of danger.</p><p>Thus, Bai Ruochen and her two world spirits all felt that Eggy was a Demon Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirit.</p><p>The world spirits of the Demon Spirit World were on par with that of the Fairy Spirit World; they were both very powerful world spirits. However, the Fairy Spirit World was a natural enemy to the Demon Spirit World, and they innately disliked one another.</p><p>Thus, even though these two Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits were stunned by Eggy&#x2019;s exceptional beauty, they felt dislike for her the moment they recalled that she was a Demon Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirit.</p><p>As for Bai Ruochen, she did not dislike Eggy. Merely, Eggy&#x2019;s cultivation disappointed her.</p><p>No matter what, her own world spirits were rank four Martial Kings. However, Eggy&#x2019;s cultivation was only a rank nine Martial Lord. To her, she was simply too unmatched with the powerful Chu Feng.</p><p>However, what Bai Ruochen did not know was that Eggy only managed to have her cultivation of rank nine Martial Lord after Chu Feng refined a lot of Martial King level experts after coming to the Holy Land of Martialism. Otherwise, Eggy would not even be a rank nine Martial Lord.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you only have a single world spirit?&#x201D; Bai Ruochen asked Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>When she saw Chu Feng nodding, Bai Ruochen did not continue to ask anymore. Instead, she turned to her own two world spirits and said, &#x201C;The two of you, after you enter there, you can only absorb half of the source energies. As for the remaining half, it&#x2019;s hers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Cheh&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, those two world spirits were somewhat displeased. However, they did not dare to refute Bai Ruochen. Thus, they ended up nodding their heads.</p><p>&#x201C;No need. There&#x2019;s no need to share them equally. Since the master of this place wanted us world spirits to earn our food with our own abilities, then we should use our own abilities to absorb source energy. You all, you must definitely not yield to me. At the same time, if you cannot absorb any source energy, you must not complain.&#x201D;</p><p>To Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s surprise, Eggy actually refused her kind intentions. Furthermore, she cast a provocative gaze toward her two world spirits.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, you&#x2019;re truly arrogant.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we are to rely on our own abilities, I fear that there wouldn&#x2019;t be any source energy left for you.&#x201D; After hearing what Eggy said, those two Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits laughed mockingly.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Faced with their mockery, Eggy only laughed disdainfully. After that, as her black miniskirt fluttered in the air, she turned into a ray of light and flew into the world spirit gate, passing through it smoothly.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, trying to get there first to obtain an advantageous position? I fear you do not have the ability.&#x201D; Seeing that Eggy had entered through the world spirit gate, those two Fairy Spirit World&#x2019;s world spirits snorted coldly, flew to the world spirit gate and smoothly passed through it too.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, isn&#x2019;t that world spirit of yours a bit too arrogant? I spoke those words for her own good. But from what she said, could it be that she felt that she would be able to absorb more source energies if there was no constraint?&#x201D; After the three world spirits left, Bai Ruochen complained to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;I do not feel that she&#x2019;s being arrogant. Instead, I feel that she&#x2019;s confident in herself.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. Ruochen, do not address her as a world spirit. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, she is not a world spirit but instead my best friend,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Hearing those words, Bai Ruochen was startled. Her expression became a bit uneasy. That was because when Chu Feng said those words, his attitude was strange.</p><p>Even though his tone was very normal, his attitude seemed to give one a sensation of being incapable of refuting his words. This meant that Chu Feng cared about his world spirit greatly. As for the level of care, it greatly surpassed her own.</p><p>However, it remained that it was a world spirit. Therefore, Bai Ruochen was puzzled by it.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz.&#x201D; Suddenly, the oppressive might that was suppressing Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen suddenly disappeared.</p><p>&#x201C;The oppressive might is gone, is the formation broken?&#x201D; With the oppressive might gone, Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen hurriedly stood up.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh.&#x201D; Right at this moment, the world spirit gate that led to the sea of remains suddenly started to slightly squirm. Soon after, a beautiful woman walked out from it. It was Eggy.</p><p>At this moment, Eggy had a very refreshed appearance. She had a smile on her exceptionally beautiful face. Her smile was truly beautiful, enough to charm one to death.</p><p>However, what was most important was that Eggy&#x2019;s aura was no longer that of a rank nine Martial Lord. Instead, she was now a rank five Martial King.</p><p>Rank five Martial King, her cultivation was two levels higher than even Chu Feng. Eggy had directly increased her cultivation from rank nine Martial Lord to rank five Martial King. From this, it could be seen that there had truly been quite a bit of source energy hidden in this place.</p><p>When she saw how Eggy&#x2019;s cultivation had increased, Bai Ruochen had an expression of anticipation on her face. With even Eggy being able to obtain this much source energy, she truly looked forward to how much progress her two world spirits would have.</p><p>Logically, with how much Eggy&#x2019;s cultivation had increased, her two world spirits&#x2019; cultivations should&#x2019;ve increased even more. It would not even be impossible for them to reach the peak of the Martial King level.</p><p>In that case, her battle power would also greatly increase.</p><p>&#x201C;Master, save us&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when Bai Ruochen was waiting with a heart filled with anticipation, two weak voices sounded from the world spirit gate.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
