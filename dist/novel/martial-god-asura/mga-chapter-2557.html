<p><strong>Chapter 2557 - Infiltrating The Kong Heavenly Clan</strong></p><p>Blue Gown. He had arrived at the Kong Heavenly Clan on his own initiative. Furthermore, he gave the Kong Heavenly Clan two promises.</p><p>The first promise was that if there were people from the Upper Realms helping Chu Feng, he would help the Kong Heavenly Clan eliminate those people.</p><p>If there was no one from the Upper Realms helping Chu Feng, then there would not be anyone in the current Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm capable of extinguishing the Kong Heavenly Clan by themselves.</p><p>As for the second promise, he declared that he would find a treasure capable of suppressing Chu Feng&#x2019;s Demon Armament. Furthermore, he was willing to lend that treasure to the Kong Heavenly Clan for the time being.</p><p>He was willing to lend that treasure to the Kong Heavenly Clan until they eliminated their great enemy, Chu Feng.</p><p>It was precisely because of that that the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief dared to declare war against Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;But, if Chu Feng&#x2019;s Demon Armament is truly that powerful, will this treasure really be useful?&#x201D; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was skeptical.</p><p>Actually, he still did not firmly believe in what had happened two years ago. After all, he did not personally witness it.</p><p>He was someone who had lived for a very long time. Yet, never had he ever heard of a mere Half Martial Ancestor relying on a single Demon Armament being able to nearly eliminate a clan with several True Immortals.</p><p>Thus, he felt the entire time that it was the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief that was incompetent, that it was merely an excuse he provided for his own failure.</p><p>However, after this mysterious blue-gowned individual appeared, he started to believe it.</p><p>To put it simply, he did not believe the words spoken by the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, but he did believe this blue-gowned individual.</p><p>No matter how powerful the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief might be, he was still only someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He was someone who felt reverence toward the experts from the Upper Realm from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>This sort of reverence made it so that he would generally believe the words of experts from the Upper Realms.</p><p>Merely, after he believed that Chu Feng really possessed one such Demon Armament, he became somewhat scared.</p><p>He was afraid that the treasure given by this Blue Gown would not be able to restrain Chu Feng&#x2019;s Demon Armament.</p><p>If it was truly unable to restrain Chu Feng&#x2019;s Demon Armament, then all of them would be no match for Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Regarding that, you all can rest assured. So-called Demon Armaments have appeared many times in the Upper Realms.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, not a single Demon Armament was able to withstand the restraint brought about by this Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even the Demon Armaments from the Ancient Era are completely useless before my Demon Armament Suppression Talisman,&#x201D; Blue Gown spoke in a very certain manner.</p><p>&#x201C;If that&#x2019;s the case, then unless that Chu Feng does not show up, the Kong Heavenly Clan will become the place where he will die.&#x201D;</p><p>After that Blue Gown spoke so determinedly, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief no longer panicked like before. An expression of anticipation actually appeared in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Back then, that Chu Feng was able to infiltrate our Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s forbidden area. He most definitely possesses a special sort of concealment method.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, we absolutely cannot be careless,&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;Regarding that, you all can rest assured. Although I cannot act directly, I am still able to help you all observe things.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As long as Chu Feng arrives in the Kong Heavenly Clan, regardless of what sort of concealment method he might possess, I will definitely be able to detect him,&#x201D; Blue Gown spoke confidently.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, we shall trouble senior,&#x201D; Everyone from the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans present bowed to express their thanks to Blue Gown simultaneously.</p><p>The reason for that was because they all knew that whether or not they would be able to win against Chu Feng in the following battle would not depend on them. Rather, it would all be dependent on the mysterious Blue Gown from the Upper Realms.</p><p>&#x201C;Prepare yourselves in the following days. That Chu Feng might show up at any moment.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When he arrives, I will inform you all of it,&#x201D; After Blue Gown finished saying those words, he entered the void.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, please wait,&#x201D; Right when Blue Gown was about to leave, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief suddenly called out.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Blue Gown did not reveal himself. However, his voice was still present in the palace hall.</p><p>&#x201C;There is one thing that this junior&#x2019;s been curious about the entire time. What sort of conflict do you have with that Chu Feng? Why are you helping us take care of him?&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked.</p><p>At that moment, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, as well as the others present, including even Grandmaster Prophet, all revealed a change in expression. They also revealed curious expressions in their eyes.</p><p>Before this, none of them knew of that Blue Gown. As such, there was simply no friendship between them.</p><p>There could only be one reason for Blue Gown to come find the Kong Heavenly Clan of his own accord and decide to help the Kong Heavenly Clan take care of Chu Feng. That is, Blue Gown possessed his own conflict with Chu Feng. However, due to some sort of restriction or inconvenience, he could only have the Kong Heavenly Clan take care of Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;There is no conflict between me and that Chu Feng,&#x201D; Blue Gown&#x2019;s voice sounded.</p><p>&#x201C;No conflict?&#x201D; The crowd all revealed surprised expressions.</p><p>There was no conflict, yet he decided to help them take care of Chu Feng? They were truly unable to understand that Blue Gown.</p><p>The reason for that was because they never believed that something would fall into one&#x2019;s lap from the sky.</p><p>At the moment when the crowd were all confused and bewildered by Blue Gown&#x2019;s response, Blue Gown&#x2019;s voice sounded again, &#x201C;I am doing this purely out of my dislike towards that Chu Feng&#x2019;s name.&#x201D;</p><p>After those words were said, that Blue Gown&#x2019;s voice never sounded again. He had truly left.</p><p>As for the people left behind, they were still completely bewildered.</p><p>Merely due to disliking someone&#x2019;s name, that mysterious Blue Gown went through that much effort to help them?</p><p>They were still unable to understand him.</p><p>Although they were unable to understand him, the corners of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s lips were raised into a pleased smile as he looked to the so-called Demon Armament Suppression Talisman in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, so what if you possess a Demon Armament? So what if you possess backing?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As long as you dare to come, you will be digging your own grave.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I am destined to win this battle.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Chu Feng had no idea about the mysterious blue-gowned individual&#x2019;s involvement with the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi could only proceed according to their plan.</p><p>Their plan was very simple. They planned to infiltrate the Kong Heavenly Clan and rescue Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Merely, in order to prevent unnecessary conflict, they could not force their way in.</p><p>Although the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s battle power had been weakened beyond recognition by Chu Feng two years ago, they could not force their way in as long as the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was still there. The reason for that was because Chu Feng could not be certain as to whether or not Zi Xunyi was able to defeat the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>After all, this was the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s territory.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng had now offended all four of the tier one powers. As such, he could not be certain as to whether the three other tier one powers would dispatch their experts to assist the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>Thus, the most effective method for them would be to use the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.</p><p>Like that, they would be able to quietly infiltrate the Kong Heavenly Clan and make a beeline for the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.</p><p>After entering the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, even if the Kong Heavenly Clan were to discover them, there would be nothing they could do. The reason for that was because they did not dare to charge into the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.</p><p>To Chu Feng&#x2019;s delight, it turned out that he was not the only one who had obtained Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s Inheritance. This Zi Xunyi had also obtained a portion of Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance over a thousand years ago.</p><p>Although the inheritance she obtained was nowhere as complete as the ones they&#x2019;d obtained, Zi Xunyi was still proficient in many wondrous spirit formations. Among them was naturally the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.</p><p>Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi jointly set up the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation. After they finished setting up their Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formations, the two of them placed the spirit formations onto their bodies. Then, they directly entered the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi entered the Kong Heavenly Clan, a pair of deep eyes suddenly opened.</p><p>It was Blue Gown&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re finally here.&#x201D;</p><p>Underneath the cloak that covered his face, a gloomy yet excited voice was heard.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
