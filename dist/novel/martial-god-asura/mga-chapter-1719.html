<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1719 - Everything Points To Disaster</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, while you can eat whatever you want, you cannot say whatever you want,&#x201D; The Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, Nangong Beidou, said with a cold voice.</p><p>He had already forcibly suppressed this matter from spreading. Thus, he did not know how this young man before him by the name of Feng Xing knew about it. However, regardless, he would absolutely not allow this to be known as the truth before all these people, else it would truly be too detrimental to the image of their Nangong Imperial Clan, detrimental to the image of his two sons. Thus&#x2026; his words were filled with threat.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, one cannot say whatever one wants. Thus, I, Feng Xing, am never one to blabber nonsense. I have merely spoken the truth.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I dare to swear to the heavens that I was not blabbing nonsense, that what I have said is the truth.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Chief, do your two sons dare to swear to the heavens that they were not beaten up by Chu Feng, stripped and hung upside down from the city gate?&#x201D; Chu Feng spoke boldly with confidence. Even when facing Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s threat, he was not afraid in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Nangong Tianhu&#x2019;s complexion turned ashen. As that was the truth, how could he possibly swear?</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your bullshit,&#x201D; As for Nangong Tianshi, he was unwilling to continue bickering with Chu Feng regarding this issue. His body trembled, and martial power began to surge forth.</p><p>His boundless martial power turned into enormous golden waves. The waves layered upon one another as they swept forward to engulf Chu Feng.</p><p>This power was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. From this, it could be seen that even though Nangong Tianshi was a rank four Half Martial Emperor, and sufficiently confident in being able to defeat Chu Feng, he did not dare to be careless. Thus, he had unleashed a fatal attack from the get-go.</p><p>&#x201C;Earthen Taboo: Heaven Sweeping Wind!&#x201D;</p><p>At the same time, Nangong Tianhu also unleashed his attack. After a loud shout, his martial power also surged forth. It turned into many streams of golden-bright and dazzling wind. The violent wind swept through heaven and earth.</p><p>Violent wind and huge waves began to wreak havoc on top of the stage. The might of the two attacks could be said to be dreadfully ferocious. With them surging toward him head-on, Chu Feng appeared to be weak like an ant, small like a speck of dust. No matter how one looked at it, he appeared to be incapable of withstanding this sort of attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Right when the attacks were about to reach Chu Feng, he laughed lightly. Then, with a thought, his clothes began to flutter, and his aura suddenly increased.</p><p>At this moment, his cultivation had gone from rank three Half Martial Emperor to rank four Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>Chu Feng had unleashed his Thunder Armor. That was how he had increased his cultivation by a level. However, there was no Thunder Armor to be seen on him.</p><p>The reason for this was because Chu Feng had deliberately concealed his Thunder Armor. The reason for that was because the Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings were the signature moves of Chu Feng.</p><p>If he were to reveal his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, the people present would definitely know that he was Chu Feng. Thus, in order to prevent that from happening, he deliberately concealed his Thunder Armor.</p><p>Even though he had concealed his Thunder Armor, Chu Feng still received an increase in strength. As a rank four Half Martial Emperor himself, how could he possibly fear two rank four Half Martial Emperors who he had defeated before?</p><p>&#x201C;Break!&#x201D; Suddenly, Chu Feng clenched his palm into a fist and shot it forth explosively. Golden martial power surged forth like a golden meteor. Nothing could stop it. In an instant, it had completely shattered both Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skills and knocked both of them off of the stage.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuwaa~~&#x201D;</p><p>At the moment they landed onto the ground, the two men vomited blood. Evidently, they had received extremely serious internal injuries. It was unknown whether Chu Feng had done so intentionally or not, as the two of them showed no signs of injuries on the surface.</p><p>Even though their outward appearances made them appear to be fine, their clothes had been completely shattered by Chu Feng&#x2019;s fist. At this moment, the two of them were completely naked and vomiting blood on the ground below the stage.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan hurriedly flew down to cover Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi&#x2019;s naked bodies. They were all gnashing their teeth in anger and looking at Chu Feng with murderous eyes. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that there were this many people here, they would definitely dismember Chu Feng into ten thousand pieces.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions were simply aimed at their Nangong Imperial Clan. He was deliberately embarrassing their Nangong Imperial Clan. Chu Feng&#x2019;s open provocation was something that they could not tolerate.</p><p>At this moment, the only person who was relatively calm was actually the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, Nangong Beidou.</p><p>Nangong Beidou was the Clan Chief of their Nangong Imperial Clan. In terms of being angry, he would naturally be the one who was the most angry.</p><p>This young man by the name of Feng Xing before him had immediately disgraced his daughter and then humiliated his two sons. Evidently, he had come to attack their Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>While he did not know why this young man before him would do such a thing, why he would set himself against their Nangong Imperial Clan the entire time, he had already placed this young man called Feng Xing onto the list of names of people whom he must kill.</p><p>Even though he had already made the decision to kill this young man, Nangong Beidou&#x2019;s appearance was very calm. He did not reveal any trace of anger at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly whose disciple is this Feng Xing? If he doesn&#x2019;t have a great teacher, how could he become this powerful?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. Even if he had concealed his cultivation, they&#x2019;re still all rank four Half Martial Emperors. It shouldn&#x2019;t be possible for him to defeat both Nangong Tianshi and Nangong Tianhu, who possess the same cultivation as him, with a single strike.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, they used Earthen Taboo Martial Skills, whereas he only used an ordinary punch. That child&#x2019;s battle power is infinitely close to that of being able to surmount four levels of cultivation! This is simply too frightening!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I think that child&#x2019;s name might be fake. Perhaps another demon-level member of the younger generation has appeared.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of the era where an Overlord will be born. The younger generation now are all extraordinary.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the crowd came to realize that this young man by the name of Feng Xing actually also possessed a rank four Half Martial Emperor cultivation.</p><p>He had concealed his cultivation. Furthermore, his battle power was also extremely strong. It was no wonder that the Three Immortal&#x2019;s disciples were all defeated by him. This young man had concealed himself extremely well. He was stronger than they had all anticipated. They were certain that he was someone with a great origin. One by one, the crowd started to have a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;The Nangong Imperial Clan is unable to withstand a single strike. Mooncloud City&#x2019;s City Master, may I step down now?&#x201D; Chu Feng revealed a very indifferent expression at the surrounding discussion. With a beaming smile, he looked to the Mooncloud City&#x2019;s City Master.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh&#x2026;&#x201D; Evidently, the Mooncloud City&#x2019;s City Master had not expected that Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation. At this moment, he was still startled. It was only after hearing what Chu Feng said that he immediately announced, &#x201C;This match is Feng Xing&#x2019;s victory. Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi are eliminated.&#x201D;</p><p>Immediately afterward, the Mooncloud City&#x2019;s City Master said, &#x201C;Next match, Dongfang Zexuan against Nangong Ya.&#x201D;</p><p>The crowd did not have any abnormal reaction to this announcement. They were all still pondering Chu Feng&#x2019;s origin.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was startled by this announcement. A trace of worry emerged in his eyes.</p><p>Nangong Ya was Chu Feng&#x2019;s friend. Currently, he possessed the cultivation of a rank three Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>As for Dongfang Zexuan, he was the Third Prince of the Dongfang Imperial Clan and a well-known genius. He was someone with exceptional talent.</p><p>When Chu Feng first met Dongfang Zexuan, Dongfang Zexuan was already a rank three Half Martial Emperor. His cultivation back then had been equally matched with Nangong Ya&#x2019;s.</p><p>However, Dongfang Zexuan was now a rank four Half Martial Emperor, an entire level above Nangong Ya&#x2019;s cultivation. For Nangong Ya to fight against Dongfang Zexuan, everything pointed to disaster.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
