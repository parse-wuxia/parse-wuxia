<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1619 - Killing Intent All Over One&#x2019;s Face</strong></p><p>Being protected by Hong Qiang, Chu Feng and the others had distanced themselves far away from the battle. However, even at their far distance, their surroundings were still trembling violently. Wave upon wave of hurricanes were sweeping toward them. If it weren&#x2019;t for Hong Qiang stopping them, Chu Feng and the others would not have been able to withstand them.</p><p>At the location where Aunt Lian and Evildoer Tie were fighting, their martial power was wreaking havoc through the sky. As far as the eye could see, rising winds, scudding clouds and bolts of lightning were occurring at the same time. The winds were no ordinary winds. The bolts of lightning were no ordinary bolts of lightning. As the winds blew the clouds away, as the lightning struck down from the sky, that region appeared to have been hit by a major disaster.</p><p>That place was already not a place where ordinary people could enter. Not to mention Martial Kings like Chu Feng, even peak Half Martial Emperors like Hong Qiang would not be able to withstand the martial powers wreaking havoc in that region, and would undoubtedly die.</p><p>&#x201C;What an intense battle. We simply cannot see anything. I can&#x2019;t even tell how the battle is unfolding. Is Aunt Lian currently teaching that old animal Evildoer Tie a lesson?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Baihe&#x2019;s eyes shone with light as she carefully watched the battle. She had used a special observation method. Unfortunately, even with her special observation method, she was unable to see anything other than the energy ripples; she was simply unable to see even the silhouettes of Aunt Lian and Evildoer Tie.</p><p>&#x201C;Let me try,&#x201D; Chu Feng activated his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes. After using the Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, even though Chu Feng was able to see the silhouettes of Aunt Lian and Evildoer Tie, he was only able to see them occasionally. Furthermore, even when he did see them, they would only last for a split second before rapidly disappearing from his line of sight. The reason for that was because the two fighters&#x2019; speed was simply too fast.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a dazzling golden light appeared in that chaotic region. It was like a golden dragon surging in the dark.</p><p>Following that, a very powerful might swept past. This might was too powerful. Chu Feng and the others were able to deeply sense how frightening that might was.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Imperial Bloodline! Aunt Lian has used her Imperial Bloodline! It would seem that she has gotten serious. Never would I have expected this Evildoer Tie to be this powerful, to actually be capable of forcing Aunt Lian to use her Imperial Bloodline,&#x201D; Nangong Baihe said.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, following that golden light, another boundlessly powerful might swept past from the battlefield. Following that, an enormous eagle head appeared following lightning flashes and thunder rolls. Even though it only lasted a split second before disappearing, Chu Feng and the others were all able to see how malevolent that enormous eagle was. Furthermore, as if it had been forged from steel, that eagle had emitted an extremely dangerous aura.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what&#x2019;s going on? What was that giant eagle earlier?&#x201D; Nangong Baihe did not manage to see what had happened clearly. Thus, she could only turn to ask Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;That was an eagle formed by Divine Power. That Evildoer Tie is actually a Divine Body. He possesses Divine Power!&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Evildoer Tie is actually a Divine Body?! That&#x2019;s a power that&#x2019;s no weaker than our Imperial Bloodline at all!&#x201D; Hearing those words, Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and even Nangong Moli all became nervous.</p><p>This battle was a lot more intense than they had imagined it would be. Even though Aunt Lian possessed her Imperial Bloodline, she was currently unable to obtain the upper hand in the battle at all. The two fighters were equally matched as they became locked in battle.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, another loud explosion sounded. Following that, a very violent energy ripple swept forth while hiding the sky and covering the earth. After the energy ripple swept past them, even though Chu Feng and the others were standing in the sky, they were still shaken left and right. If it weren&#x2019;t for Hong Qiang protecting them, that energy ripple would likely have injured, if not killed, Chu Feng and the others.</p><p>Too frightening. A battle of that level was truly not something that Chu Feng and the others could interfere with. Even watching the battle, they would have to be extremely cautious and distance themselves far away.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Why does it seem like Aunt Lian&#x2019;s Imperial Bloodline has weakened?&#x201D; At this moment, Nangong Ya and the others were greatly alarmed. They discovered that the golden dazzling light that had appeared like a golden dragon on the battlefield before was currently growing weaker.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what happened?&#x201D; Extremely nervous, Nangong Baihe turned to ask Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian is injured. That Evildoer Tie is holding an actual Incomplete Imperial Armament. In terms of weapons, Aunt Lian is at a disadvantage,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What? That Evildoer Tie actually possesses an Incomplete Imperial Armament?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the expressions of Nangong Ya and the others turned even more unsightly.</p><p>&#x201C;You all, quickly, get out of here!!!&#x201D; Right at this moment, a voice transmission entered into Chu Feng and the others&#x2019; ears. It was Aunt Lian.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it! Even though they&#x2019;re both rank one Martial Emperors, could Aunt Lian really not be a match for that Evildoer Tie?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What should we do? I cannot look on helplessly as Aunt Lian is killed by that animal!&#x201D; After hearing Aunt Lian&#x2019;s voice transmission, both Nangong Ya and Nangong Baihe became extremely worried. All of a sudden, they did not know what to do. However, neither of them had the intention to escape.</p><p>&#x201C;You all, leave here first,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what did you say?&#x201D; Nangong Ya was astonished by Chu Feng&#x2019;s words. With a shocked expression, he looked to Chu Feng. He didn&#x2019;t understand Chu Feng&#x2019;s intentions.</p><p>&#x201C;I said, you all leave first. I&#x2019;ll stay behind to help Aunt Lian,&#x201D; Chu Feng said again.</p><p>&#x201C;You help Aunt Lian? I haven&#x2019;t misheard, right? How are you going to help Aunt Lian? That is a battle between Martial Emperors. Even senior Hong Qiang is unable to intervene, how are you able to help Aunt Lian?&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Nangong Baihe opened her mouth wide in shock. She simply did not believe in Chu Feng&#x2019;s words.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you all know why I needed the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones? I needed them in order to set up two Taboo Formation Techniques.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I am able to set those Taboo Formation Techniques up successfully, we will be able to escape from danger today,&#x201D; Chu Feng said as he took out all of the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones.</p><p>The Taboo Formation Techniques Chu Feng spoke of were naturally the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation and the Evil Spirit Binding Formation. In this moment of crisis, Chu Feng did not wish to resign himself to fate. Thus, the only thing he could do was set up those two Taboo Formation Techniques and release the other world spirit in his body.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you serious? Exactly what sort of spirit formation will be able to take care of a Martial Emperor?&#x201D; Nangong Baihe was still very skeptical. That was because she had never heard of such powerful spirit formations before. Even if they were Taboo Formation Techniques, she had still never heard of ones capable of taking care of Martial Emperors. Thus, she still did not believe in Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what degree of certainty do you have in successfully setting up the spirit formations?&#x201D; Nangong Ya asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Around fifty percent,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied. What he said was the truth. At this moment, it could be said that he was not prepared at all. If he were to try to set up the two Taboo Formation Techniques, he would really only have fifty percent certainty for success.</p><p>&#x201C;What will happen if you are to fail?&#x201D; Nangong Ya asked.</p><p>&#x201C;If I am to fail, the consequences will be unthinkable,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a light smile.</p><p>&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, we will stay to accompany you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You do not need to urge us to leave. Even if you do, we will not leave. There&#x2019;s no need to mention Baihe and Moli. As for Miss Tantai and Senior Hong, I believe that the two of them will insist on staying too,&#x201D; Nangong Ya said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Chu Feng, you cannot be this selfish. Today, we will live or die together. Don&#x2019;t you try to be the hero yourself,&#x201D; Nangong Baihe said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Big brother Chu Feng, Moli will also stay with you,&#x201D; Even Nangong Moli said she&#x2019;d stay. A determined expression was present on her innocent little face.</p><p>&#x201C;As the senior, perhaps what I am about to say is not suitable. However, I feel that what the two little friends from the Nangong Imperial Clan said is reasonable,&#x201D; Hong Qiang said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, whatever abilities that you possess, just use them fully,&#x201D; Tantai Xue said with a smile. Rarely did Tantai Xue smile. Thus, when she did, her smile was exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, then we shall stake our all on this together,&#x201D; Faced with this bunch of stubborn people, Chu Feng smiled calmly. Then, he placed all of the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones before him and began to prepare to set up the two Taboo Formation Techniques.</p><p>&#x201C;Found you all,&#x201D; Suddenly, a voice sounded from beside Chu Feng and the others. Turning their head around to look, Chu Feng and the others were all greatly alarmed. It was actually Evildoer Tie. Evildoer Tie had appeared behind Chu Feng and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Evildoer Tie attacked. He grabbed Chu Feng&#x2019;s neck and lifted him up.</p><p>Seeing that, Hong Qiang wanted to attack. However, without even moving, Evildoer Tie merely swept his aura forth and Hong Qiang was knocked several tens of thousands of meters away. Hong Qiang ended up vomiting blood. He was seriously injured.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, you are the one who scammed me at the auction, right?&#x201D; Evildoer Tie looked at Chu Feng with an expression filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
