<p><strong> Chapter 1903 - The Avaricious Immortal&#x2019;s Provocation</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What the Avaricious Immortal said is correct. These two Blood Devouring Armors indeed already possess masters. Furthermore, they are, respectively, Princess Miaomiao and Young Master Yuyin,&#x201D; After inspecting the two Blood Devouring Armors, Chu Feng spoke to the crowd.</p><p>&#x201C;How could that be?&#x201D; At that moment, many people revealed depressed expressions. As matters stood, they all wished for Chu Feng, and not Xian Yuyin, to accompany Xian Miaomiao into the Blood Devouring Killing Formation.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard! Who said that you can make your own decision to tailor-make those Blood Devouring Armors for Xian Yuyin and me? Did you get our consent?!&#x201D; At that moment, Xian Miaomiao was so enraged that her little face turned red with anger, and she flared out at the Avaricious Immortal on the spot.</p><p>&#x201C;Miaomiao, do not be rude,&#x201D; The Elf King said.</p><p>&#x201C;Princess Miaomiao, please quell your anger. This matter is not at all related to me. It was a decision made by my senior brother.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, Princess Miaomiao, please do not blame my senior brother either. Back then, none of us expected for little friend Chu Feng to suddenly appear. We all thought that you and Young Master Yuyin would be the ones going together. That&#x2019;s why&#x2026;&#x201D; he sighed. &#x201C;Anything I say would be useless. There is already nothing that I can change about this situation. If Princess Miaomiao wishes to blame someone, please blame me.&#x201D;</p><p>With a &#x2018;putt,&#x2019; the Avaricious Immortal half kneeled onto the ground. Although his action might seem righteous, many people felt that he was only acting pretentiously.</p><p>In fact, when Chu Feng declared that those two Blood Devouring Armors were tailor made, the Avaricious Immortal was already bursting with joy. The reason for that was that this meant that his world spirit techniques were extremely powerful, and he had managed to deceive Chu Feng.</p><p>At that moment, although Xian Yuyin and his father did not have any physical reaction, they were also extremely overjoyed in their hearts.</p><p>Especially when they recalled how insufferably arrogant and awe-inspiring Chu Feng was last night, they felt even more refreshed. The reason for that was because they were finally able to see Chu Feng being defeated.</p><p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly said, &#x201C;Miaomiao, do not worry. Although these two Blood Devouring Armors were indeed prepared for you and Young Master Yuyin, I merely need to slightly alter the one prepared for Young Master Yuyin to be able to don it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?&#x201D; Once Chu Feng&#x2019;s words were said, not to mention Xian Yuyin and his father, even Xian Miaomiao and the other Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves were all shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, is what you said for real?&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao asked in an extremely excited manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. This is nothing difficult,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled and nodded.</p><p>However, the Avaricious Immortal immediately said, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you must not act recklessly. These Blood Devouring Armors are items created by my senior brother through many days of effort. I know their characteristics the best. Now that they have been completed, if you are to alter them of your own initiative, you will make the Blood Devouring Armor lose its usefulness.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if you are able to successfully don it, the Blood Devouring Armor will not be able to protect you in the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. At that time, what use is there for you to enter the Blood Devouring Killing Formation? You would simply be throwing your life away.&#x201D; It was as if he had already prepared for this.</p><p>Xian Miaomiao was stupefied upon hearing those words. Even though she wanted to be angry, she did not know how. The reason for that was because she was unable to ascertain whether what the Avaricious Immortal said was true or not.</p><p>It would be one thing if what the Avaricious Immortal said was false.</p><p>However, if what he said was the truth, wouldn&#x2019;t Chu Feng be courting death by entering the Blood Devouring Killing Formation while wearing the Blood Devouring Armor?</p><p>That was a responsibility that Xian Miaomiao was unable to bear, something that none of the people present were able to bear.</p><p>Thus, at that moment, this was already no longer an issue of worry for Xian Miaomiao and Princess Lingyue. Instead&#x2026; the Four Grand Elders, as well as the Protectors, were also very worried.</p><p>At that moment, only two people remained calm. They were Chu Feng and the Elf King. Chu Feng was extremely confident and not alarmed in the slightest.</p><p>As for the Elf King, he did not say a single word, and he also appeared very calm and collected. His relaxed appearance was as if he was enjoying a show.</p><p>Chu Feng smiled again and then said, &#x201C;I think that, Avaricious Immortal, you are over-worrying. This Blood Devouring Armor is not as difficult to handle as you imagined it to be. There is no need for you to worry, I can handle it myself,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, do you not trust me?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Trust you? How am I to trust you? It is true that the Blood Devouring Armors were tailor made for Princess Miaomiao and Young Master Yuyin. However they were not tailor made from the very beginning. Instead, they were altered last night,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what is the meaning of your words?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p>&#x201C;What is the meaning? You should know best yourself. They were altered by you last night.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the purpose of your actions, I believe only you and Young Master Yuyin know, no?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled coldly as he took a glance at Xian Yuyin.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t you wrongly accuse me!&#x201D; Xian Yuyin shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I knew that you hold a prejudice toward me. However, you shouldn&#x2019;t slander me like this, no? I, Avaricious, am always one who is straightforward and upright in my manner of conduct. How could I possibly do such a thing?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal tried his best to defend himself.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, how about we go and find the Immeasurable Immortal and have him check it out?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That would naturally be the best. But, my senior brother had an important matter to take care of. He will not be able to return to the Elf Kingdom for the time being,&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;The Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists of the Holy Land of Martialism are not only limited to you, myself and the Immeasurable Immortal. We can go and find another Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist to evaluate these Blood Devouring Armors,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Chu Feng would naturally not really waste time to go to find someone else to evaluate the Blood Devouring Armors. He had only said that for the sake of publicly unmasking the Avaricious Immortal.</p><p>The Avaricious Immortal looked to Chu Feng and said confidently, &#x201C;Chu Feng, if you truly wish to find someone to evaluate them, I will naturally be able to accompany you to find someone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, it is not that I am arrogant, but even if you are able to find another world spiritist, they will not necessarily be able to determine if they have been altered better than me. After all, I, the Avaricious Immortal, have trained in world spirit techniques for over five thousand years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And you&#x2026; how long have you trained in world spirit techniques? What makes you qualified to question me? Do you really think that you can disregard everything just because you&#x2019;re a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let me tell you, even among Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, there will be differences in strength.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course there&#x2019;s a difference in strength. However, I wish to remind you that your ranking among the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists is not high at all,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you are truly impudent! As part of the younger generation, is this how you speak to your senior?!&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;That would have to depend on what sort of senior I am speaking with. For a senior that is willing to kill you, while you don&#x2019;t possess any grievances or hatreds with him, all for the sake of his own personal benefits, let me ask you, what sort of attitude should I have when speaking with that kind of senior?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile and a mocking tone.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you looking down on my world spirit techniques? Since you&#x2019;re this arrogant, do you dare to compete against me?&#x201D; The Avaricious Immortal did not answer Chu Feng&#x2019;s question. Instead, he issued a challenge to Chu Feng. He did not answer Chu Feng&#x2019;s question because he was, after all, in the wrong.</p><p>&#x201C;Compete? Compete again? Do you think you&#x2019;re even qualified to compete against Chu Feng? Take a mirror and look at yourself. Then ask yourself whether or not you are even qualified to compete against Chu Feng,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao pointed at the Avaricious Immortal and said one word at a time.</p><p>After Xian Miaomiao said those words, many of the people present all revealed an eased expression. She had said what they all wanted to say.</p><p>While it was true that the Avaricious Immortal was Chu Feng&#x2019;s senior, there was a heaven and earth difference in the moral character of the two of them.</p><p>The Avaricious Immortal was unworthy of being Chu Feng&#x2019;s senior.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
