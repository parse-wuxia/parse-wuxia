<p><strong> Chapter 2306 - Heroes Appear In Chaotic Times</strong></p><p>&#x201C;I have already cured my husband&#x2019;s injury. He will wake up soon.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After my husband wakes, we are to go to the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds together,&#x201D; The demonic woman said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;E-ex-extremely Remote Un-unmarked Burial Mounds? W-Why the h-heck are w-we going there?&#x201D; Right after the demonic woman said those words, Wang Qiang immediately sat up and spoke in protest.</p><p>&#x201C;Husband, you&#x2019;ve awakened? How did you wake up so quickly? Were you pretending to be unconscious?&#x201D; The demonic woman walked toward Wang Qiang and asked him with a skeptical expression.</p><p>&#x201C;W-why w-would I p-pretend? I w-was s-startled aw-awake by you,&#x201D; Wang Qiang curled his lips and continued to protest, &#x201C;W-why the heck a-are we going to the Extremely R-remote Unmarked Burial Mounds? Have y-you g-grown tired of living?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Husband, that remnant in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds was discovered by me. That is Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remnant.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is very possible that that remnant contain Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance. As for Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance, it is no small matter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, you, Chu Feng and I, the three of us, are all Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. As such, how could we possibly let the remnant slip by us?&#x201D; The demonic woman said to Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;W-while w-what you said is t-true, t-there are that many powers g-gathered here, t-that many e-experts f-focused on t-the Extremely Remote U-unmarked Burial Mounds. H-how c-could w-we possibly f-fight w-with them?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;F-furthermore, b-both y-you and Chu Feng a-are w-wanted individuals. It&#x2019;s t-t-too dangerous,&#x201D; Wang Qiang shook his head. He truly did not wish to go.</p><p>&#x201C;Seems like you don&#x2019;t understand. After all, the remnant was discovered by me. Those people might not necessarily know what I know. As long as I go, we will definitely be able to profit from it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the so-called being wanted, we could just disguise ourselves. Who could possibly see through us?&#x201D; The demonic woman said.</p><p>&#x201C;Demonic woman, do you hold certainty of success?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked the demonic woman.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. I never do things I have no certainty of.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, that old fart that snatched away my Moonlight Immortal Spirit Grass is also in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds. I will definitely find him and get my revenge. This is a rare opportunity, and I am not planning to let it slip by,&#x201D; The demonic woman said resolutely.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, we can go then. Wang Qiang, you should just listen to your wife and go have a look. That Grandmaster Kai Hong was indeed an extraordinary individual. I also do not wish to miss this opportunity,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Wang Qiang.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother, you also w-wish to g-go?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;S-since you a-also wish to go, t-then let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said frankly.</p><p>&#x201C;The hell! What is the meaning of this? When I said we should go, you started to give all kinds of excuses. Yet, when Chu Feng said we should go, you immediately agreed to it?&#x201D; The demonic woman was very displeased, and grabbed Wang Qiang&#x2019;s lapel.</p><p>&#x201C;N-n-no, I a-am m-mainly obeying y-your desire,&#x201D; Seeing that the demonic woman was angered, Wang Qiang hurriedly submitted to her.</p><p>The current Wang Qiang was no longer poisoned. As such, the demonic woman was no longer gentle toward him all the time anymore.</p><p>Once the demonic woman started getting aggressive, Wang Qiang would immediately submit to her. Otherwise, he would end up suffering.</p><p>For someone as shameless as Wang Qiang, he would possess that sort of foresight.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s also you, Chu Feng. Enough with the &#x2018;demonic woman,&#x2019; &#x2018;demonic woman.&#x2019; I have a name, okay?&#x201D; Then, the demonic woman turned her annoyed gaze to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;You have a name? In that case, what is your name?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Hong,&#x201D; That demonic woman replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Hong?&#x201D; Hearing that name, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart immediately moved.</p><p>Wasn&#x2019;t Zhao Hong the name that demonic woman had in her previous life?</p><p>However, according to that mysterious old monk, the demonic woman should not be able to remember her memories from her previous life. Could it be that the demonic woman had regained the memories of her previous life?</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Hong, who gave you that name?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked in a probing manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Regarding that, I am also not too certain. Merely, ever since I was born, I knew my name to be Zhao Hong,&#x201D; The demonic woman said.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, the things regarding the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower, your martial skills and world spirit techniques, were they things that you learned afterwards, or did you already know about them since birth?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re the same as my name,&#x201D; The demonic woman said.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case,&#x201D; At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized that the demonic woman had not forgotten all of the memories of her previous life.</p><p>She still remembered a bit.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, this demonic woman is truly pitiful. She doesn&#x2019;t even remember her previous life&#x2019;s memories. Should we tell her the truth so that she can live her life as a human and not as a monster?&#x201D; Right at that moment, Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps knowing about those memories will make her whole, but it might be better for her not to know about those memories. After all&#x2026; those were not fond memories.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Moreover, she might not necessarily believe my words,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Her Lady Queen.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true too. This demonic woman possesses a very violent and unstable temper. It would also be good to not let her know about those things.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If she doesn&#x2019;t believe you and feels that you are deceiving her, you will end up suffering.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if she believes you, she might also end up going out of control due to shock. At that time, you will also suffer.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since that is the case, it is better to not tell her about it,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Since we&#x2019;ve decided, let&#x2019;s get going,&#x201D; The demonic woman said.</p><p>&#x201C;W-wait. W-with the way y-you look now, y-you&#x2019;ll scare people to d-death by going out. C-can&#x2019;t y-you disguise y-yourself s-so that y-you look more normal?&#x201D; Wang Qiang said.</p><p>&#x201C;What is this? You&#x2019;re thinking that your wife is ugly?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the demonic woman was immediately angered.</p><p>&#x201C;N-no, no, no, how c-could I think my w-wife to be ugly? I w-was o-only considering our safety,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, changing my appearance is but a simple task,&#x201D; As the demonic woman spoke, a layer of Immortal level spirit power covered her body. Then, the demonic woman&#x2019;s appearance turned into that of a very beautiful-looking woman with an alluring figure.</p><p>The appearance that the demonic woman changed to was most definitely that of a decently beautiful woman.</p><p>Merely, she was too sexy and too alluring. While she would attract many a men, she was unable to enter Chu Feng&#x2019;s discerning eye.</p><p>&#x201C;T-too vulgar. C-c-can&#x2019;t you d-disguise y-yourself as a m-more m-modest woman?&#x201D; Wang Qiang sighed and said in a dissatisfied manner.</p><p>&#x201C;What? You actually dislike your wife&#x2019;s aesthetics?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the demonic woman grabbed Wang Qiang&#x2019;s ear.</p><p>&#x201C;N-no, no, no, wife, I-I w-was wrong,&#x201D; Wang Qiang immediately started to cry out in pain. However, it was evident that he was still unsatisfied with the demonic woman&#x2019;s appearance.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng involuntarily recalled how the demonic woman looked in her previous life, the appearance of that Zhao Hong.</p><p>She was truly a rarely seen beauty.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Hong, how about you allow me to change your appearance for you instead?&#x201D; Chu Feng said to the demonic woman.</p><p>Hearing those words, the demonic woman revealed an angry, blade-like gaze toward Chu Feng.</p><p>The reason for that was because the demonic woman noticed that Chu Feng was also not fond of the beautiful appearance she had given herself.</p><p>However, for some unknown reason, she hesitated, and did not act out violently against Chu Feng. Instead, she nodded and said, &#x201C;Very well, I&#x2019;ll give you a chance.&#x201D;</p><p>Then, Chu Feng immediately set up a spirit formation to help the demonic woman change her appearance.</p><p>A sweet appearance, a natural and unrestrained flow with extraordinary airs. Although she was wearing a red skirt, she still looked like a celestial fairy.</p><p>As for this, it was none other than Zhao Hong&#x2019;s original appearance.</p><p>&#x201C;How is it? Is it to your satisfaction?&#x201D; Chu Feng formed a mirror with his spirit formation and reflected the current appearance of the demonic woman.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s alright.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, taking into consideration that you&#x2019;re attentive, I&#x2019;ll use this appearance.&#x201D;</p><p>Although the demonic woman only said &#x2018;it&#x2019;s alright,&#x2019; Chu Feng was able to tell that she was very fond of her current appearance.</p><p>The reason for that was because the demonic woman was already moving toward the outside. From her lively footsteps and joyful movements, Chu Feng was able to tell that the demonic woman&#x2019;s mood was extremely good right now.</p><p>&#x201C;How is it? Are you satisfied?&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to Wang Qiang with a beaming smile. He seemed to be joking around with him.</p><p>&#x201C;W-while I am satisfied, u-unfortunately that is her t-transformed appearance, and n-not her actual appearance,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with disappointment.</p><p>&#x201C;No, that is the original appearance of that demonic woman. To be exact, that is Zhao Hong&#x2019;s original appearance,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Wang Qiang using voice transmission.</p><p>&#x201C;R-really?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s expression changed. A special sort of light shone in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Why would I deceive you?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, t-that&#x2019;s pretty good then.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go. Let&#x2019;s c-check out the Extremely R-remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps an o-op-opportunity will present itself amidst t-the chaos, and we&#x2019;ll be a-able to escape,&#x201D; At this moment, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s mood also became extremely good. Even though he was speaking of escaping, he was rapidly chasing after the demonic woman. Furthermore, while chasing after her, he shouted, &#x201C;W-w-wife! W-wait for me!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, I think that Wang Qiang suits that demonic woman quite well,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>&#x201C;Why is that?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked in a puzzled manner.</p><p>&#x201C;A weirdo fits a weirdo,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;That seems to be reasonable,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, his body also moved as he began to chase after them.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng was also excited.</p><p>The reason for that was because he was also looking forward to their trip to the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.</p><p>After all, there was a huge gathering of experts there. Even if he was unable to obtain anything from going there, he would be able to gain experience. This would be a rare opportunity.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng firmly believed that heroes appeared in chaotic times.</p><p>The more chaotic a place was, the greater the chance of the emergence of heroes.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
