<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 757 - Bloodthirsty Demon</strong></p><p><span style="">At that instant, the lightning surrounding his body jumped about and kept on making </span><i><span style="">bzzz</span></i><span style=""> sounds.</span></p><p><span style="">As his long, black hair fluttered about in chaos, his eyes could be seen. The eerie glint it emitted was the combination of the three lightnings.</span></p><p><span style="">However, what the eyes emitted was iciness, heartlessness.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng grabbed Qin Yu&#x2019;s broken arm, and slowly raised it. Then, he did something that completely stupefied Qin Yu.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng opened his mouth, revealing his ferocious teeth, and bit down. He bit away a big chunk of Qin Yu&#x2019;s torn arm, and started chewing it in his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="">Blood started flowing out of Chu Feng&#x2019;s mouth in large amounts, but it wasn&#x2019;t Chu Feng&#x2019;s. It was Qin Yu&#x2019;s. Not only was Chu Feng gnawing on Qin Yu&#x2019;s flesh and blood, he even made a grin. He seemed like a bloodthirsty monster enjoying a rare delicacy.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You demon!&#x201D; Qin Yu felt all of his hair stand on end. An indescribable feeling of terror permeated his bones.</span></p><p><span style="">It was the first time in his life that he feared a person like that. Without thinking anymore, he turned around, and tried to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Pah!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">But just at that moment, Chu Feng widened his mouth and a blood-red mass burst out. It was Qin Yu&#x2019;s flesh that he was gnawing on just now.</span></p><p><span style="">Most importantly, that ball of flesh, after exiting Chu Feng&#x2019;s mouth, had an extraordinary amount of force. Like an indestructible arrow, it tore through the air, leaving behind a bright red streak, and with a </span><i><span style="">puchi</span></i><span style="">, it pieced into Qin Yu&#x2019;s chest.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh!&#x201D; Such powerful force made Qin Yu fall onto the ground and cry out. When he looked at his chest, and discovered a huge cavity there, he almost cried from fright.</span></p><p><span style="">If he knew that the cavity was pierced through by a chunk of his own hand, who knew what he would feel.</span></p><p><span style="">*bang* Just at that moment, the hand Chu Feng used to grab Qin Yu&#x2019;s torn arm clenched, and Qin Yu&#x2019;s arm then, after a muffled explosion, broke into pieces.</span></p><p><span style="">Following that, Chu Feng walked towards Qin Yu with quick steps, stretched out, and with a ripping sound, forcefully tore Qin Yun&#x2019;s other arm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2014;&#x201D; Qin Yu howled from the pain of his arm being torn. The previous one was done when he didn&#x2019;t realize it, but this time, he personally witnessed his arm being torn off. He truly saw the pain in his eyes, and felt the pain in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="">However, the surprise still came afterwards. Chu Feng spun Qin Yu&#x2019;s arm with his hand at the end of the arm, then waved it and slammed it towards Qin Yu&#x2019;s face.</span></p><p><span style="">*bam bam bam bam* Sharp sounds such as those kept on resounding. Chu Feng was using Qin Yu&#x2019;s own palm to slap his own face.</span></p><p><span style="">Moreover, Chu Feng was very fierce. After only a few slaps, Qin Yu&#x2019;s face was a mash of flesh of blood. After a few more slaps, even his skin and blood on his face were scraped away, and what remained was only eerie white bones.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Damn you! Continue this, I dare you! I&#x2019;m not afraid of you!&#x201D; Qin Yu, who looked absolutely nothing like before, hysterically howled.</span></p><p><span style="">*puchi* But just at that moment, Chu Feng stamped down. Qin Yu&#x2019;s body instantly quivered once, then it completely froze.</span></p><p><span style="">It was because Chu Feng&#x2019;s stamp resided upon the </span><i><span style="">root of his life</span></i><span style="">&#x2014;the thing he used to defile countless women&#x2014;and it was now crushed by Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahh&#x2014;&#x201D; Feeling the thing below flattened, Qin Yu once again let out a howl.</span></p><p><span style="">That was not only a howl of pain, it was a howl of fury originating from his heart. He was truly angry. Even though he knew he was facing an extremely terrifying demon, after the thing he took pride in was squashed, his rage also fiercely jumped out.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, I&#x2019;ll kill you, I&#x2019;ll kill you, I&#x2019;ll definitely kill you! I will kill everyone related to you, or else I will be unable to vent the hatred in my heart!&#x201D; Qin Yu&#x2019;s words were ones that came from deep inside. He truly hated every single part of Chu Feng, and he really did want to kill Chu Feng&#x2019;s entire family, and eradicate his entire clan.</span></p><p><span style="">But, Chu Feng was not the slightest bit afraid of Qin Yu&#x2019;s threats. Instead, he made a hint of a sneer&#x2014;one of disdain.</span></p><p><span style="">*gulp* After seeing the cold smile on Chu Feng&#x2019;s mouth, Qin Yu&#x2019;s prior arrogance was no more because only then did he realize how idiotic he was.</span></p><p><span style="">Before Chu Feng, how was he even qualified to be arrogant? He had to worry not only for his own life, but also his family&#x2019;s lives. Before his very eyes was a true demon!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ahhh&#x2014;&#x201D; Soon, Qin Yu&#x2019;s miserable cry rang out again, within it contained his desire to die. But, the torture merely only began.</span></p><p><span style="">No matter how much more miserable Qin Yu&#x2019;s cries were, there was no one who would save him because the Spirit Formation he himself laid had blocked off everything.</span></p><p><span style="">That being said, however, in the sky outside the palace, Taikou was standing within the clouds. His eyes were extremely sharp, even better than an eagle&#x2019;s vision. He was not only able to see everything below, he could even see through the Spirit Formation and everything that Chu Feng did and was doing to Qin Yu.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, even the mysterious cultivation expert furrowed his brows. There was actually a bit of worry in his eyes. After a long while, he sighed. &#x201C;What kind of power is in this boy&#x2019;s body? It is simply so immeasurably deep and so unfathomable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It even affects his nature. Is there truly a demon inside his body?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Sigh. It&#x2019;ll be fine if he walks righteously in the future, but if he walks on the path of evil, I&#x2019;m afraid all the living in this world will not escape a calamity.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng knew nothing about Taikou&#x2019;s spying; the fury in his heart had already flooded his reason. Even though Qin Yu had no more signs of life, he didn&#x2019;t stop.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng!&#x201D; Only until a voice with anguish sound out did Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes light up, returning to their former state.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Little Mei?&#x201D; It was Su Mei&#x2019;s voice that let Chu Feng recover his rationality. At that moment, the lightning on Chu Feng&#x2019;s body could no longer been seen, and his terrifying aura disappeared simultaneously as well, but the memory from before still remained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What happened just now? I seem to have gotten that lightning&#x2019;s power, but my mind was also affected.&#x201D; Chu Feng looked at Qin Yu whose sight was unbearable, and couldn&#x2019;t help sinking into contemplation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng&#x2026;&#x201D; Just at that moment, Su Mei&#x2019;s voice rang out again.</span></p><p><span style="">But this time, it was not only with anguish. There was also seductive panting, and her voice was also accompanied by allure. All in all, it was extremely attracting.</span></p><p><span style="">Turning his head around, even Chu Feng couldn&#x2019;t help inhaling deeply. His eyes also immediately came into focus.</span></p><p><span style="">Because Su Mei who was presented before himself was at the peak of her enticing state.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
