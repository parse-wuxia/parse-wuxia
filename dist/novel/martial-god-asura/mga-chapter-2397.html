<p><strong> Chapter 2397 - Clearly Bullying Another</strong></p><p>Seeing the spittoon Wang Qiang held in his hand that contained the profoundness of martial cultivation, Chu Feng smiled and shook his head. He said, &#x201C;Wang Qiang, I&#x2019;ve said it many times already. That belongs to you. I will not use it, nor could I use it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is better that you use it sooner. Perhaps it will help you advance your cultivation by leaps and bounds. At that time, if we are to encounter dangers, you will be able to protect me.&#x201D;</p><p>Wang Qiang had told Chu Feng to use the spittoon countless times in the past few days. However, the spittoon could also be of enormous assistance to Wang Qiang. As such, how could Chu Feng possibly be willing to use it?</p><p>&#x201C;I t-truly d-don&#x2019;t understand. W-we&#x2019;re b-brothers, i-is there even a n-need for you to be this courteous with m-me? Don&#x2019;t y-you need it now? Since y-you need it, j-just use it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;W-while this p-place contains treasures, t-the treasures a-are e-extremely dangerous to o-obtain. If y-you are to use this, y-you might be able to reach a breakthrough i-in cultivation. W-wouldn&#x2019;t t-this help y-you i-increase the certainty in being able to obtain your t-treasures more?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If y-you r-really feel that y-you c-cannot accept it, w-wouldn&#x2019;t it be fine f-for you to j-just g-give me something f-from the treasures y-you&#x2019;ll be o-obtaining from here?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;At t-that time, e-even if you a-are to r-repay me in double, I w-would have n-no objections either. Hehehe,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with a mischievous laugh.</p><p>However, how could a small trick like this possibly work on Chu Feng? Chu Feng knew very well that Wang Qiang was saying these things so that he would use the martial cultivation spittoon.</p><p>As for the future, even if Chu Feng was to really obtain something akin to the martial cultivation spittoon, Wang Qiang would most likely refuse to accept it.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother, there are things that one can yield to another, and things that one cannot.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If this item was useless to you but useful to me, then I would definitely accept it even without you telling me about it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the truth is that this item is extremely useful to you. Perhaps you might need it even more than me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I appreciate your kind intentions. However&#x2026; you should still keep this for yourself,&#x201D; Chu Feng said resolutely.</p><p>Chu Feng possessed his own principles. In order to increase his cultivation, he was willing to scramble, battle and put his life on the line.</p><p>However&#x2026; he absolutely would not allow himself to take something from his brother. That&#x2026; went against Chu Feng&#x2019;s martial cultivation principle.</p><p>&#x201C;Forget about it, forget about it. There&#x2019;s t-truly nothing I can do a-about you. T-there are c-countless people that would enter closed-door training for their entire life t-to no avail in order to attain a single breakthrough in cultivation. If I were to g-give this t-to them, they w-would d-definitely accept it even if they must l-lose their entire f-family&#x2019;s fortune for it, much less o-obtaining it for free.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Y-yet, you are being so f-foolish as to refuse it. I a-am not mocking you here, but you a-are the g-greatest f-fool in this world,&#x201D; Seeing that he was unable to win against Chu Feng, Wang Qiang started to speak sarcastic remarks toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;No, at the very most, I would be the second greatest fool in this world,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;W-why&#x2019;s that?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s because the greatest fool would be you. When has there ever been someone who would be willing to give their opportunity to reach a breakthrough to another person instead of using it themselves? Exactly how many people kicked your head in your childhood for you to do something like that?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a laugh.</p><p>&#x201C;Fuck! W-with m-merely those words you&#x2019;ve said, e-even if you want it now, I w-will not be g-giving it to you,&#x201D; Wang Qiang gave Chu Feng a side-eye, and then took back the martial cultivation spittoon.</p><p>&#x201C;Is Chu Feng present?!!!&#x201D; Right at that moment, a shout suddenly sounded from outside the palace.</p><p>Although the voice was not extremely resounding, it was capable of shaking one&#x2019;s heart. That voice had spoken with oppressive might.</p><p>&#x201C;That group of a-annoying people is h-here again. It s-seems that w-we must quickly announce that we&#x2019;re in c-closed-door training so that t-they will not c-continue to demand t-to see us everyday,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said impatiently.</p><p>&#x201C;No, the ones this time have not come with good intentions,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s expression also changed. Then, he used a special method to observe the situation outside, and discovered that there was indeed a group of people gathered outside the palace.</p><p>Merely, this group of people were not outsiders that had come to pay Chu Feng and Wang Qiang respects. Rather, they were people from the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>They were all from the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation. Furthermore, they were actual people of the younger generation. With Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&#x2019;s observational abilities, they were able to tell that this group of people were all less than a hundred years old.</p><p>As for their cultivation, they were not weak either. The man leading the group was even a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor, an actual peak Half Martial Ancestor, an existence a step away from becoming a Martial Ancestor.</p><p>Over the days Chu Feng and Wang Qiang had been in the Kong Heavenly Clan, there had been people from the younger generation of the Kong Heavenly Clan that came to pay them visits from time to time. Furthermore, as Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were fond of observing things, they already knew that this bunch were among the most elite of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation.</p><p>One thing worthy of mentioning was that even Kong Zheng was among them. Merely, Kong Zheng had not come to cause trouble. On the contrary, he was kindly trying to persuade the peak Half Martial Ancestor leading the group to not do this.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Ruozeng, I am truly not deceiving you. That Chu Feng and Wang Qiang are not individuals with undeserved reputations, they are really Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s successors,&#x201D; Kong Zheng said.</p><p>&#x201C;People like them were able to obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s treasures? They most definitely used tricks,&#x201D; The peak Half Martial Ancestor leading the group said with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I refuse to believe that they will be as powerful as they&#x2019;re said to be,&#x201D; At the same time, the other people of the younger generation also began to echo his words in agreement. Their tones were very vile. It could be said that they were filled with contempt for Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.</p><p>Actually, after Chu Feng and Wang Qiang arrived at the Kong Heavenly Clan, it was not only the outsiders that came to pay respectful visits to them, there were also some members of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation that came to pay their respects to them out of admiration.</p><p>Those people were all people that revered Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, and wanted to befriend them.</p><p>However, at the same time, there was also a portion of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation that simply did not believe that Chu Feng and Wang Qiang possessed actual abilities. They were filled with grievances and hostility toward Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.</p><p>It was clear that the group of people that had come this time were all of the latter kind. They came to look for trouble.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Ruozeng, please hear me out. I thought of Chu Feng the same way as you all before, I simply did not place Chu Feng in my eyes. Thus, I once fought against that Chu Feng. However, it ended miserably for me,&#x201D; Kong Zheng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, Kong Zheng, don&#x2019;t you go shaming yourself here. Look at your cultivation, and look at big brother Ruozeng&#x2019;s cultivation. You actually want to compare yourself to big brother Ruozeng? You are simply overestimating your capabilities,&#x201D; Someone mocked Kong Zheng.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, my cultivation is inferior to brother Ruozeng&#x2019;s. But what about big brother Kong Cheng? Even big brother Kong Cheng was unable to defeat Chu Feng and his friends when fighting against them. Do you all really think that brother Ruozeng will be a match for them?&#x201D; Kong Zheng refuted angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the people that had spoken to mock Kong Zheng grew quiet. Although Kong Cheng&#x2019;s age had surpassed that of the younger generation, it remained that he was a rank one Martial Ancestor. They would not dare to deny the fact that Kong Cheng was more powerful than Kong Ruozhen.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, I&#x2019;ve heard that Chu Feng is merely a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor right now. I refuse to believe that I cannot defeat him,&#x201D; However, after hearing what Kong Zheng said, that Kong Ruozeng grew even more displeased.</p><p>He pointed at the palace that Chu Feng was in and shouted loudly, &#x201C;Chu Feng! I am a member of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s younger generation! My name is Kong Ruozeng! I have come here to challenge you today! If you are a man, then come out and accept my challenge!&#x201D;</p><p>Although his voice was not resounding, the oppressive might contained in the voice grew stronger and stronger. Furthermore, that oppressive might was completely aimed at the palace hall Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were in.</p><p>&#x201C;F-fuck! S-sure enough, they&#x2019;ve come to l-look for trouble. I-I&#x2019;ll go out and t-teach that bastard,&#x201D; Wang Qiang revealed an angry look. He planned to go out and confront Kong Ruozeng.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait,&#x201D; However, Chu Feng grabbed Wang Qiang. He said, &#x201C;He has clearly asked for me. If you are to go out, I fear that it will go against his desires.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
