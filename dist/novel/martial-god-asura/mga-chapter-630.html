<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 630 - Who Exactly Are You</strong></p><p><span style="">At the same time, in the center of the palace, the cross that bound Chu Feng still remained, but no more traces of him did.</span></p><p><span style="">Although Chu Feng was gone, there were a few rows of words left in the center of the palace. They were words made by Spirit Formations, and the content was&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I thank Beauty Ya Fei for her generous gift; Wuqing shall accept them all. In the future, Wuqing will definitely repay such a chest-rending favour by many times.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit. It was him!&#x201D; The smart Ya Fei immediately understood the truth: the one who robbed the place wasn&#x2019;t a traitor in the Immortal Execution Archipelago. It was the person she locked in the treasury.</span></p><p><span style="">She thought that this place was indestructible, so imprisoning Chu Feng here to make him a puppet was the best location. Yet, she never would have expected Chu Feng to use some unknown method to not only escape, but to also rob everything, making her take such a huge blow.</span></p><p><span style="">At that moment, Ya Fei gritted her teeth in anger. Even her chest could explode from fury, and she was so angry that smoke could be seen coming from her facial orifices. She clenched her fist tightly and ferociously said, &#x201C;Wuqing, Wuqing, Wuqing! Damn Wuqing!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So the one who saved the monster with Little Fishy was you! I&#x2019;ve truly underestimated you. I didn&#x2019;t expect you to have this ability. Not only did you escape from this treasury, you even stole a year&#x2019;s worth of profit from my Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But don&#x2019;t you worry. I have never suffered losses from anyone. Don&#x2019;t even think of being an exception.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Do you truly think you can escape from my palms? I will let you know what I am capable of. It is something that you cannot even imagine. You will all die!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, Ya Fei suddenly willed, and formless aura instantly spread everywhere. With a bang, the Spirit Formation words Chu Feng left behind were shattered, and simultaneously, strong bloodlust filled the entire palace.</span></p><p><span style="">As Ya Fei became enraged, Chu Feng and Little Fishy had already left the Everlasting Sea of Blood. The reason why they were so fast was naturally all because of Little Fishy&#x2019;s speed.</span></p><p><span style="">Although they had already left, for safety&#x2019;s sake, they did not remain on top of the sea surface. They entered the sea and laid a Concealment Spirit Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Who exactly are you?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At present, Chu Feng was carefully examining the monster. He then discovered that it was as if the densely-packed water grasses were merged with its body. And even with his Spirit power, he could not detect anything through them. He could not examine its condition. Even using the Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes he could not.</span></p><p><span style="">So, that made a thought enter his head&#x2014;the monster was truly only a monster. Its appearance was indeed only of a special monster. Then yet, why did that monster have such a familiar feel to it? And why didn&#x2019;t it kill him?</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">However, just as Chu Feng was patching up his guesses, the monster suddenly opened its eyes. Immediately as the blood-red eyes appeared, Chu Feng felt extremely dense bloodlust.</span></p><p><span style="">But the bloodlust only existed for a moment before disappearing into nothingness, as in the moment the monster saw Chu Feng, its blood-red eyes instantly brightened. Obviously, it recognized him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You really do recognize me? Who are you? Where did you come from?&#x201D; Seeing such a reaction, Chu Feng hurriedly barraged it with questions. He truly wanted to know why the monster didn&#x2019;t kill him, exactly how it was related to him, and whether or not it was truly related to his ancestry.</span></p><p><span style="">*wuao* However, just at that moment, the monster hugged its head with both hands and knelt on the floor. It started to cry in anguish. Its voice was loud, causing the Spirit Formation they were in to violently shake.</span></p><p><span style="">At first, Chu Feng panicked a bit as he faced such a change from the monster because he could not be sure if the monster was truly not going to harm him or not. With its strength, if it truly lost control and wished to harm Chu Feng, he would not be able to do anything at all.</span></p><p><span style="">But, Chu Feng gradually discovered that concurrent to the monster&#x2019;s cries of agony, its voice actually changed as well. From the low roar of something like a wild beast, it slowly became a human-like sound.</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, the monster&#x2019;s appearance also changed. The long water grasses started to retract, then at the end, it became a humanoid shape.</span></p><p><span style="">It was a female, covered by blue-coloured scales all across her body. But, she still had blood-red eyes and her face was fraught with pain as she screamed miserably.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s you?!&#x201D; After seeing that person, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed greatly too as he felt such disbelief. Because, he had already recognized who the person in front of him was.</span></p><p><span style="">She was the number one disciple of the Jade Maiden School from the continent of the Nine Provinces, the one who </span><i><span style="">had a relationship</span></i><span style=""> with Chu Feng, Yan Ruyu.</span></p><p><span style="">Although she looked nothing like before, as she lost all of her former beautiful complexion, Chu Feng was still able to determine that the female was Yan Ruyu.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng was truly a bit befuddled at that moment. He had made many guesses, trying to speculate the identity of the monster, but it being Yan Ruyu didn&#x2019;t even cross his mind.</span></p><p><span style="">After all, the monster was currently so strong, yet Yan Ruyu&#x2019;s strength back then wasn&#x2019;t very strong. Even though she practiced Forbidden Mysterious Techniques, it shouldn&#x2019;t be possible for her to reach her present stage of strength.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Scram! Quickly scram! Or else, I will kill you!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Just at that moment, the monster suddenly roared furiously at Chu Feng. Though its voice was a bit rigid and full of resentment, the tone did indeed belong to Yan Ruyu, no doubt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Waa, now </span><i><span style="">this</span></i><span style=""> is interesting. Chu Feng, this ruthless monster that refines humans is actually your former lover! No wonder she isn&#x2019;t willing to kill you. Hehe.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After recognizing Yan Ruyu, even Eggy was surprised. But, she was different from Chu Feng. As the bystander, she clearly had an attitude of schadenfreude as she looked at the drama, lacking any fear of aggravating the situation.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why has this happened? How can it be you?!&#x201D; Upon recognizing Yan Ruyu, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze glittered, his heart in complete disorder.</span></p><p><span style="">Because looking at it from a certain point of view, the reason why Yan Ruyu became what she is today was all because of Chu Feng. If Chu Feng hadn&#x2019;t forced a &#x201C;relationship&#x201D; with Yan Ruyu, it wouldn&#x2019;t have made the Forbidden Mysterious Technique she practiced in lose control.</span></p><p><span style="">Although it was Yan Ruyu in the wrong at first, after all, Chu Feng hadn&#x2019;t had too severe of a loss. It was only because he wanted to vent his anger that he turned a female with quite a good future into her current appearance that looked neither like a human nor a ghost. Deep in Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart, the only thing surging about was regret.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wa ha ha ha ha ha!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;How can&#x2019;t it </span><i><span style="">not</span></i><span style=""> be her?!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, just as Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart was in chaos&#x2014;having quite some trouble accepting the truth in front of his eyes&#x2014;Yan Ruyu suddenly laughed sinisterly, and extremely strangely as well. Even her speaking voice became abnormally sharp.</span></p><p><span style="">Looking back at Yan Ruyu in front of his eyes, Chu Feng discovered that the scales on her body had already faded away, turning her back into the former alluring, great beauty.</span></p><p><span style="">Seductive curves, snow-white skin, pretty face, bright eyes, fiery, exceptional body, all of that was not covered by anything at present. In complete bare nakedness, it appeared before Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">But facing such changes from Yan Ruyu, Chu Feng lightly furrowed his brows, as if he understood something, then fiercely and austerely asked, &#x201C;Who exactly are you?!&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
