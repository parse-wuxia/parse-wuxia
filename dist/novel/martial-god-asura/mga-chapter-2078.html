<p><strong> Chapter 2078 - Crimson Jade Pendant</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Brat, what are you laughing about?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng was actually laughing with such contempt and mockery, that Clan Chief of the Blood Qilins&#x2019; expression grew even uglier.</p><p>Ever since he had appeared, even Huangfu Haoyue did not dare to look at him with such contempt.</p><p>Yet, at that moment, that brat actually did not place him in his eyes at all. He truly felt as if his heart, liver, spleen and lungs were about to explode from excessive anger.</p><p>Thus, his shout of anger was not an ordinary shout. Instead, it contained a dense amount of his oppressive might. Even space itself started to tremble.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>However, after sensing that oppressive might, Chu feng&#x2019;s laughter grew even louder. He felt as if a little kitten was trying to display its might before a tiger.</p><p>&#x201C;You damned brat, did you think that I would not dare to kill you?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng&#x2019;s attitude remained the same even after he had revealed his oppressive might, the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief was gnashing his teeth in anger. As he spoke, one could even hear the sound of his gritted teeth.</p><p>&#x201C;Martial Emperors are extremely powerful. How about you let me experience the abilities of a Martial Emperor?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Come, come, come. I will stand here without moving. You can attack me as you wish. Let&#x2019;s see if you can injure me,&#x201D; As Chu feng spoke, he stepped forward.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you cannot be careless, he is really a Martial Emperor!!!&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s action, Huangfu Haoyue and the others were all deeply alarmed. Immediately, they spoke to advise Chu Feng against it.</p><p>After all, the strength of the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief was something that they had all personally seen. Even Huangfu Haoyue, a Martial Emperor, found him hard to deal with.</p><p>Yet, Chu Feng was actually planning to stand there and allow himself to be attacked? Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions would simply be courting death.</p><p>Being shouted at by the crowd, Chu Feng stopped his footsteps. He turned around and said, &#x201C;Seniors, do not worry about me. If he is able to injure me with his strength, then it would mean that I, Chu Feng, am incompetent.&#x201D; After saying those words, Chu Feng smiled confidently and then continued onward.</p><p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Huangfu Haoyue and the others&#x2019; expressions all grew stiff.</p><p>It was not that their tolerance for surprises was low. Rather, what Chu Feng said, &#x2018;If he is able to injure me with his strength, then it would mean that I, Chu Feng, am incompetent,&#x2019; was truly too shocking.</p><p>What sort of strength did that Blood Qilin Clan Chief possess? In their eyes, he was an actual Martial Emperor. If even a Martial Emperor could not injure Chu Feng, didn&#x2019;t that mean that Chu Feng was even more powerful than Martial Emperors?</p><p>At this moment, when the crowd were all staring at Chu Feng&#x2019;s back with gazes filled with incomparable shock, Chu Feng had arrived at a distance less than a hundred meters from the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief and stopped.</p><p>&#x201C;Brat, exactly what are you planning?&#x201D;</p><p>However, at that moment, the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief was hesitant to attack Chu Feng. He was confused as to what Chu Feng was planning.</p><p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t appear to be pretending to be looking down on him. Rather, it appeared like he was looking down on him from the bottom of his heart. This caused him to feel extremely uneasy. The confidence that he had always had started to sway.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m allowing you to attack me, yet you don&#x2019;t even dare to do that. You are truly trash,&#x201D; Chu Feng said mockingly.</p><p>&#x201C;Damned brat! If you wish to die, I shall help you accomplish your goal!&#x201D; The word &#x2018;trash&#x2019; caused the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief to explode with killing intent. Then, he shot a punch at Chu Feng. Surging martial power turned into an enormous golden fist that ruthlessly smashed toward Chu Feng.</p><p>At that moment, Huangfu Haoyue, Qiu Canfeng and many others did not dare to continue to watch. They closed their eyes. They were deeply afraid that Chu Feng would be smashed to death by that punch.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, when that golden fist landed onto Chu Feng, it suddenly exploded.</p><p>That explosion was extremely ear-piercing. Following that, a strange scene occurred. At the moment when the energy ripples from the explosion were about to spread, they suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Most importantly, Chu Feng was still standing in midair. Not only was he not harmed in the slightest, even his clothes were completely undamaged.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, is this the attack of a Martial Emperor? Why is it that the attack was unable to even harm a single hair of mine?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a mocking smile.</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D; At that moment, everyone was stunned. Even though the attack from the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief was something that no one other than Huangfu Haoyue was able to clearly see, they had all felt a fatal power from that attack.</p><p>To them, that power was not only something they could not withstand, it was also devastating. If they were to be struck by it, they would undoubtedly die.</p><p>Earlier, that power had clearly landed on Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng was still standing there, completely unharmed. That was truly too unbelievable.</p><p>&#x201C;G-great!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As expected from my disciple, as expected from my, Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s, disciple!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the crowd were all wild with joy. Qiu Canfeng even started to shout in excitement.</p><p>As matters stood, they were completely convinced that Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength surpassed every one of them. Not only was he a Martial Emperor, he was definitely not an ordinary Martial Emperor.</p><p>Else, it would be impossible for him to possess strength that completely surpassed the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly who are you?&#x201D; At that moment, the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief was frowning deeply.</p><p>He was the person that shot out that fist strike earlier. Thus, he knew best how powerful that punch of his was. Not to mention others, even he himself would be seriously injured should he receive that punch.</p><p>Yet, the young man before him was completely uninjured. That made him realize that this young man was most definitely not someone ordinary. At the very least, his cultivation surpassed his own.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is he? He is this old man&#x2019;s disciple, our Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master, Chu Feng!!!&#x201D; Before Chu Feng could speak, Qiu Canfeng spoke proudly. Especially when he said that Chu Feng was his disciple, his aged face was filled with pride as he said those words.</p><p>&#x201C;What?! Chu Feng?! You are Chu Feng?!!!&#x201D; Hearing the name &#x2018;Chu Feng&#x2019;, the expression on the Blood Qilin Clan Chief&#x2019;s face changed enormously.</p><p>&#x201C;No, shouldn&#x2019;t you have entered the Heavenly Road?! Why would you appear in the Eastern Sea Region?!&#x201D; The Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief asked in an extremely puzzled manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, my disciple has returned from the Holy Land of Martialism,&#x201D; Qiu Canfeng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Holy Land of Martialism, he actually successfully entered the Holy Land of Martialism, and even returned safely. No wonder, no wonder,&#x201D; At that moment, the Blood Qilin Clan Chief&#x2019;s expression grew even uglier.</p><p>Suddenly, with a &#x2018;putt,&#x2019; he actually knelt in midair and began to kowtow to Chu Feng. He begged, &#x201C;Lord Chu Feng, I have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. I was wrong to attack you earlier.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Please, please spare my life, please give our Blood Qilin Race another chance. From today on, we will serve you, we will do as you command.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>No one expected that the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief would actually kneel to Chu Feng, kowtow and beg for forgiveness. Not only were Qiu Canfeng and the others surprised, even the Blood Qilins were shocked.</p><p>The Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief turned to his clansman and shouted, &#x201C;What are you all still standing there for?! Quickly, apologize to Lord Chu Feng!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Chu Feng, please spare us!!!&#x201D; After hearing the shout from their clan chief, the rest of the Blood Qilins all knelt in midair and began to kowtow to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Earlier, you all were trying to kill the people that I consider to be closest to me. Yet now, you all are begging for forgiveness. How am I supposed to trust you all?&#x201D; Chu Feng narrowed his eyes and fixed his gaze onto the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Chu Feng, in order to express my sincerity, I will offer you our Blood Qilin Race&#x2019;s most valuable treasure,&#x201D; As the Blood Qilins&#x2019; Clan Chief spoke, he took out an item from his Cosmos Sack. It was a crimson jade pendant.</p><p>Upon seeing that pendent, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes immediately started to shine. That pendant contained a special power. To monstrous beasts, it would most definitely be a cultivation treasure that could rapidly increase their cultivation.</p><p>However, to humans, that pendant was useless. The reason why Chu Feng was so shocked was not because of the pendant&#x2019;s special usage. Rather, it was because Chu Feng felt a familiar aura from that pendant.</p><p>It was Little Fishy&#x2019;s aura.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
