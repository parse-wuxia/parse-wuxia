<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1401 - Teach You How To Conduct Yourself</strong></p><p>Right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded from the sky above, &#x201C;Who would&#x2019;ve expected such a person like you to appear in the Cyanwood Mountain? It would seem that Qin Wentian and Qin Lingyun&#x2019;s statuses will soon be rattled.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, while I do not care about what you might be in the Cyanwood Mountain, if you dare to behave atrociously in our World Spiritist Alliance, I will definitely not let you do as you wish,&#x201D;</p><p>The crowd turned their heads toward that location. However, there was actually not a single soul in sight. Yet, as the crowd&#x2019;s gazes fixed on that place, splash-like ripples began to form there. Soon, those ripples began to move about even more quickly.</p><p>Very soon after that, a silhouette appeared from that empty space. Calmly, he walked out.</p><p>This man&#x2019;s age was about the same as Sun Hao&#x2019;s. However, his cultivation was on par with Chen Mu&#x2019;s. He was also a rank eight Martial King.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that this man was superior to Chen Mu in all aspects.</p><p>Firstly, his heaven-defying battle power was even stronger than Sun Hao&#x2019;s. He possessed a battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. His true battle power was on par with rank two Half Martial Emperors.</p><p>Although he was only a rank eight Martial King, he was definitely capable of fighting Sun Hao on equal footing. Thus, he was naturally also capable of fighting Chu Feng after he unleashed his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings.</p><p>Furthermore, even when not mentioning his cultivation and battle power, his world spirit techniques were also extremely exceptional. Earlier, before he had spoken, Chu Feng had not sensed his existence at all.</p><p>He had not known that such a person was hiding in the empty space in the sky secretly observing the match between him and Chen Mu.</p><p>Chu Feng had only not detected him because he had not tried to consciously search for people hidden in his surroundings, as he had been wholeheartedly concentrated on dealing with Chen Mu.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit power was already exceptionally sharp. Even when he was focused on fighting someone, he still possessed a very sharp perception of his surroundings.</p><p>Yet, this man had been able to escape from Chu Feng&#x2019;s senses. That was already sufficient to prove that he possessed extraordinary world spirit techniques. At the very least, his ability to conceal himself was very strong.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior brother Zhao Kai, never would I have imagined that even he would come. This is great, this is truly great.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, there is hope left for our World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s younger generation. Senior brother Zhao Kai is ranked third on our World Spiritist Succession List, and is one of our World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s three strongest geniuses. With him here, Chu Feng is undoubtedly going to lose.&#x201D;</p><p>After they saw this person, the disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance burst into ecstasy once again. They were many times more excited than when Chen Mu had appeared.</p><p>However, compared to them, Sima Ying was frowning deeply. Even Sun Hao, Huang Feng and the others that were very optimistic of Chu Feng started to have ugly expressions of unease on their faces at this moment.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, be careful. You must not underestimate him. This Zhao Kai is extremely powerful. Not only does he possess tyrannical battle power, his world spirit techniques are also extremely strong.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the Royal Metamorphosis Formation this time around, he nearly managed to break apart the bindings of gold spirit power and become a royal-cloak world spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If the Royal Metamorphosis Formation had been capable of lasting for one more day, he would definitely have been able to become a royal-cloak world spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, his Zhao Family&#x2019;s ancestor is also an elder of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly,&#x201D; Right at this time, Sima Ying&#x2019;s warnings sounded in Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t be careless this time around. That Zhao Kai is much more powerful than me. While you were able to defeat me, you might not necessarily be able to defeat him.&#x201D;</p><p>To Chu Feng&#x2019;s surprise, after Sima Ying sent him a voice transmission, he actually also received a voice transmission from Sun Hao.</p><p>His formidable opponent from several days ago actually warned him to not underestimate Zhao Kai. Furthermore, based on his tone, it didn&#x2019;t seem like he wasn&apos;t lying to Chu Feng. Instead, he was sincere in his warning Chu Feng to be careful.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, I truly never expected that you&#x2019;d be thinking of my wellbeing,&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to Sun Hao in the crowd and replied with a voice transmission while smiling.</p><p>Regardless of what sort of person Sun Hao was before, at this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s opinion of Sun Hao had changed somewhat.</p><p>After all, this place was the World Spiritist Alliance. Regardless of whether it might be because of the grievances between them from before or the honor of their World Spiritist Alliance right now, this Sun Hao should be wishing for Chu Feng&#x2019;s defeat. Yet, at this moment, he actually warned Chu Feng. This truly came as a surprise to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;I am not thinking for your good. Merely, I do not wish for you to be defeated that easily. After all, you are someone who has defeated me,&#x201D; Sun Hao said.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed mischievously. He no longer tried to say anything anymore. He knew that regardless of how tight-mouthed Sun Hao might be, he had, in fact, obtained Sun Hao&#x2019;s acknowledgement.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng looked to that Zhao Kai and asked, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong, have you also come to represent your World Spiritist Alliance and teach me a lesson?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I must admit, you are very powerful. At the very least, among the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s disciples, your world spirit techniques are the most powerful that I&#x2019;ve seen.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you must know that this place is the World Spiritist Alliance, and not your Cyanwood Mountain. Regardless of how powerful your world spirit techniques might be, this is not a place where you can behave so atrociously.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, allow me, Zhao Kai, to teach you how to conduct yourself,&#x201D; Zhao Kai said loudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Teach me how to conduct myself? Do you have the ability to do so?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You must know, it is not good to boast only to result in biting your tongue, to walk with large strides only to result in tripping.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the end, you, who wishes to teach someone how to conduct themselves, might instead be taught how to conduct yourself,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile. Even though he knew that this Zhao Kai was no small matter, Chu Feng was still willing to provoke him regardless.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your nonsense. I will only ask you this, do you dare to accept my challenge or not?&#x201D; Zhao Kai raised his sharp sword-like eyebrows and asked with a cold voice. As a proud, blessed child of the World Spiritist Alliance, very few people dared to speak to him in such a manner.</p><p>Yet today, Chu Feng dared to do so. Furthermore, he did so before this many people. As such, Zhao Kai was naturally angered.</p><p>At this moment, he was itching to teach Chu Feng a lesson so that Chu Feng would know how tall the sky was and how thick the ground was. At the same time, he would be able to retrieve the lost dignity of their World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s younger generation.</p><p>&#x201C;How do you wish to compete? Through martial techniques or world spirit techniques? Go ahead, pick your option,&#x201D; Chu Feng spread open his hands and spoke in a very indifferent manner.</p><p>&#x201C;When competing in our World Spiritist Alliance, we will naturally have to do so with world spirit techniques,&#x201D; Zhao Kai said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, how do you wish to compete then?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Hah&#x2026;&#x201D; Zhao Kai did not respond to Chu Feng&#x2019;s question. Instead, he suddenly laughed. Furthermore, his laughter was filled with mockery. Only after a very long time did he say, &#x201C;World spirit techniques are world spirit techniques. World spirit techniques possess countless changes and are omnipotent. Yet, you actually asked me how I want to compete? Truly ridiculous.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;.........&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Exactly what did senior brother Zhao mean by that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know. World spirit techniques are composed of many different things. If one does not clarify the type, how would one compete?&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing what Zhao Kai said, the disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance were also confused.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, I understand,&#x201D; However, to their surprise, when even they did not understand what Zhao Kai meant, Chu Feng nodded with a smile on his face.</p><p>Zhao Kai&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he loudly asked, &#x201C;You truly understand?&#x201D; It seemed that even he was unconvinced that Chu Feng truly understood what he meant.</p><p>&#x201C;You, will use all of the world spirit techniques that you know.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And I, will use all of the world spirit techniques that I know.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Regardless of what sort of world spirit technique it might be, regardless of what sort of spirit formation it might be, as long as we can surpass the other, it would be sufficient. Am I right?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
