<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1795 - Sweat Like A Pig</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, not only have you snatched away my treasures, you&#x2019;ve even humiliated me like this. I will definitely not let you get away with this, I absolutely will not let you get away with this!!!&#x201D; Leng Yue roared angrily.</p><p>Her voice filled with grievance echoed through this entire sealed region. Even after a very long time, her voice was still echoing.</p><p>&#x201C;I have merely returned what you&#x2019;ve done to my friends, merely given you a taste of your own medicine,&#x201D; Chu Feng said disapprovingly.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;re dead, you&#x2019;re definitely dead. Even though I am unable to kill you, once you leave this fort, you will definitely die.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will report to the Heavenly Law Palace that you have stolen my Cosmos Sacks and Incomplete Imperial Armament using a despicable method. Our Heavenly Law Palace will not let you get away with this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While the Four Great Imperial Clans are unable to capture you, if our Heavenly Law Palace wishes to handle you, it&#x2019;ll be as easy as crushing an ant to death,&#x201D; Leng Yue knew that she was no match for Chu Feng. Thus, she began to use her Heavenly Law Palace to threaten Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Clap, clap, clap, clap~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to clap. He said, &#x201C;Leng Yue, you are truly one to never break your promises. Not only have you refused to accept your loss, you even plan to file a false countercharge against me, plan to say that I have stolen your things. No matter what, you are still a young woman. How can you be this shameless?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There can never be too much deception in war. That is something that you said. If you are to return my treasures right now, I can consider letting you go,&#x201D; Leng Yue said ruthlessly. Even though she was saying that she&#x2019;d let Chu Feng go, the murderous intention in her eyes did not lessen in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve already broken your promise once. Yet, you actually still have the nerve to say these kinds of words. Do you really think that I will trust you?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether you trust me or not. You have no other option. This is the only conclusion that you shall have for going against me, Leng Yue,&#x201D; Leng Yue said.</p><p>&#x201C;No,&#x201D; Chu Feng shook his head. Then, he said, &#x201C;I still have another path that I can take.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, Leng Yue became nervous. Even though Chu Feng was saying those words without anything to back them up, she felt unease as she looked at Chu Feng&#x2019;s confident appearance.</p><p>&#x201C;Eggy, it&#x2019;s your turn,&#x201D; Chu Feng turned his gaze to Eggy.</p><p>&#x201C;No problem,&#x201D; Eggy removed the ring from her finger and tossed it to Chu Feng.</p><p>After Chu Feng caught the ring, he began to form hand seals with one hand. It was not a martial technique. Rather, it was a world spirit technique.</p><p>As Chu Feng continued to form hand seals, that ring began to shine brightly. An image began to appear from the light.</p><p>Not only were there images, there were also voices...</p><p>&#x2018;Leng Yue, you said that as long as I come to fight you, you will bestow me with a gift. What might that gift be?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Of course.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;These bits of things, are you trying to shoo a beggar away?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You actually think that that is insufficient? You must know that these are ten Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D; Seeing till this point, Leng Yue&#x2019;s expression changed enormously. The reason for that was because the contents that the light was revealing was precisely the scene of her agreement with Chu Feng. Furthermore, the image was still continuing. This meant that Chu Feng had used a special world spirit formation to record the entire process of their fight.</p><p>Although she didn&#x2019;t know how Chu Feng had managed to do it, it remained that he had done it.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you wish to continue watching? Truth be told, I&#x2019;ve recorded from the beginning till the end. Even the scene of you bathing in the cesspool was recorded.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you wish to let everyone know that you, Leng Yue, have not only been defeated by me, Chu Feng, but also that you&#x2019;ve also bathed in my dung, gone back on your promise, and want to file a false countercharge against me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then, go ahead, try it. Tell the Heavenly Law Palace that I have stolen your treasures. As long as you dare to do that, I will reveal all that has been recorded here to the public,&#x201D; Chu Feng fiddled with the ring in his hand and spoke with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, those images could totally be fake. Even if you are to spread them, no one will believe you,&#x201D; Leng Yue said.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, the images could be fake, the voices could be fake. But, could the might of the Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal also be fake?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled again. Then, he put the ring onto his own finger and looked to Leng Yue, &#x201C;Leng Yue, if you have the courage to do so, let&#x2019;s play. I dare to wager that as long as I reveal the contents of this recording, eighty percent of the people will believe it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Leng Yue grew quiet. She was speechless. She naturally knew that there would definitely be people who would believe the recording should it be shown.</p><p>As for her, she could not allow others to know about what had happened here today. If it were to be known, her reputation would be completely ruined. She would also not be able to continue to be the Heavenly Law Palace&#x2019;s number one disciple, continue to be the head of the Heavenly Generals, or even continue to survive in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>However, she was extremely unreconciled. Not only had Chu Feng humiliated her and snatched away her treasures, he was even holding the means to blackmail her in his hand. Today, she had been utterly defeated.</p><p>Feeling unreconciled, Leng Yue said angrily, &#x201C;Chu Feng, you are truly despicable!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Despicable? You&#x2019;re wrong. I, Chu Feng, have always been a straightforward and upright individual. However, when faced with despicable people like you, I can only use despicable methods,&#x201D; Chu Feng said in a disapproving manner.</p><p>As Chu Feng said those words, he had a smile, an extremely wicked smile, on his face the entire time. However, that smile left Leng Yue speechless.</p><p>Leng Yue knew very well that if Chu Feng had not prepared this, she would have definitely broken her promise today. Not only that, she would have also borrowed the strength of the Heavenly Law Palace to take care of Chu Feng.</p><p>Even though she was feeling very unreconciled, and deeply hated Chu Feng, Leng Yue also felt great admiration for Chu Feng. It was as Chu Feng had said. She, Leng Yue, had not been wrongly defeated. It was not that she was too weak. Rather, it was that her opponent, Chu Feng, was simply too strong.</p><p>Seeing that Leng Yue had become quiet, Chu Feng knew that she had reached a compromise. Thus, Chu Feng began to slowly walk toward Baili Xinghe.</p><p>Seeing Chu Feng approaching him, Baili Xinghe grew extremely nervous. He had seen with his own eyes how Chu Feng had used various methods to toy around with Leng Yue.</p><p>At this moment, Baili Xinghe was deeply aware of the terror that was Chu Feng. Even Leng Yue was no match for Chu Feng. As such, how could he, Baili Xinghe, possibly be able to contend against Chu Feng?</p><p>Chu Feng looked to Baili Xinghe and said, &#x201C;Baili Xinghe, what did you say earlier? Come, say it again.&#x201D;</p><p>Baili Xinghe gulped down a mouthful of saliva. Then, nervously, he said, &#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, I was in the wrong earlier. As a person of great moral stature, please forgive the offenses committed by this one of low moral stature. Please, let me off this one time.&#x201D;</p><p>Although Baili Xinghe was begging Chu Feng for forgiveness, he did not dare to even look Chu Feng in the face as he begged. He was truly afraid that Chu Feng would kill him.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh, look at your cowardly appearance,&#x201D; Seeing Baili Xinghe trembling in fear because of him, Chu Feng laughed with contempt. Then, he said, &#x201C;Taking the Weaponry Refinement Immortal into consideration, I will not kill you.&#x201D; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he turned around and left.</p><p>&#x201C;Huuu~~~&#x201D; After hearing those words, Baili Xinghe finally heaved a sigh of relief. As he saw Chu Feng gradually growing further and further away, he thought to himself, &#x201C;Chu Feng, I knew that you wouldn&#x2019;t dare to kill me. Heh, I admit that you have some skills. While I am no match for you alone, I have plenty of methods to take care of you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While Leng Yue will hide all that has happened here today, I will not. As long as I spread this matter, even though Leng Yue will become extremely infamous, the Heavenly Law Palace will definitely not let you get away with it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, your decision to not kill today is a mistake. I&#x2019;ll have you know my ability. As for your women, they will, sooner or later, be mine.&#x201D; When thinking of these things, the corners of Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s mouth lifted into a treacherous smile. He had already made plans to take care of Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Taa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly stopped his footsteps.</p><p>Seeing Chu Feng standing there, Baili Xinghe started to grow so nervous that his soul was nearly about to fly out from his body. He thought to himself, &#x201C;Could it be that he can even hear what I said to myself in my heart?&#x201D;</p><p>Thinking of that, Baili Xinghe began to sweat like a pig...</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
