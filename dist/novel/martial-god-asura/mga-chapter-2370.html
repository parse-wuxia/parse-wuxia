<p><strong> Chapter 2370 - Reaching The Hundred Refinements Stage</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng?!&#x201D;</p><p>Kong Zheng was extremely shocked to hear Chu Feng&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>However, he did not realize the incoming crisis. Instead, with his Incomplete Ancestral Armament in hand, he turned around and moved to attack Chu Feng, who had arrived behind him.</p><p>&#x201C;Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation!!!&#x201D;</p><p>However, before Kong Zheng could attack, Chu Feng shot forth his punch ferociously.</p><p>Chu Feng did not hold back, and directly unleashed his strongest attack, the Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>As the distance between them was extremely close, Chu Feng&#x2019;s punch landed on his body before Kong Zheng could react.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Upon being struck by Chu Feng&#x2019;s punch, Kong Zheng was struck flying straight toward the surface. In the end, he crashed into the ground.</p><p>The Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation was extremely mighty. After Kong Zheng was smashed into the ground, not only did he leave an enormous crater, the energy ripples from the aftermath of the Heavenly Dome Transformation began to sweep out in all directions, engulfing that region. It was truly chaotic.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be?&#x201D;</p><p>However, Chu Feng did not have any joy on his face. Instead, he revealed enormous shock and unease.</p><p>Although Kong Zheng&#x2019;s cultivation was a level above Chu Feng&#x2019;s, and his overall strength was a tier above Chu Feng&#x2019;s, Chu Feng felt that an attack from the Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation at such close range should be sufficient to kill Kong Zheng.</p><p>However, through his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to clearly see that Kong Zheng did not die. Not only was he alive, he did not even suffer any serious injuries. There was merely a trace of blood flowing out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Furthermore, at that moment, Kong Zheng had climbed out from the ravine. As if nothing major had happened, he wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth in a de-emphasizing manner.</p><p>Although he was not seriously injured, Kong Zheng was still incomparably shocked. He raised his head and looked to Chu Feng with a gaze filled with astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;I truly never expected to be played for a fool by you,&#x201D; Kong Zheng said as he fixed his eyes onto Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;And I never expected that you would have such a treasure on you. It must be what saved you, no?&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze was fixed onto Kong Zheng&#x2019;s chest.</p><p>Actually, Chu Feng had long since discovered that Kong Zheng was wearing inner armor beneath his clothes.</p><p>That inner armor had a very ordinary appearance and Chu Feng had not noticed anything unusual about it before. However, at that moment, that ordinary-looking inner armor was no longer ordinary in appearance. At that moment, the aura it emitted was extremely powerful.</p><p>Chu Feng was certain that the inner armor was a treasure, a very powerful protective treasure. Unless Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation surpassed Kong Zheng&#x2019;s by an entire level, even if Chu Feng possessed the same cultivation as Kong Zheng, he would only be able to seriously injure Kong Zheng, and not kill him.</p><p>Yet, not only was Chu Feng&#x2019;s current cultivation not stronger than Kong Zheng&#x2019;s, it was instead weaker. As such, it meant that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to kill Kong Zheng.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that it&#x2019;s a bit late for you to discover that I possess the protection of a treasure.&#x201D;</p><p>As Kong Zheng spoke, he tossed his Incomplete Ancestral Armament toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Roarrr~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The very next moment, that Incomplete Ancestral Armament began to emit a golden radiance. With the Incomplete Ancestral Armament as the center, the golden radiance turned into an enormous thousand meter-long sword. The sword began to fly toward Chu Feng.</p><p>That enormous sword was so powerful that it shook even space itself. As it moved, it brought forth violent winds.</p><p>That was an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, as Kong Zheng possessed a higher cultivation than Chu Feng, the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill he unleashed was much more powerful than Chu Feng&#x2019;s Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation.</p><p>Most importantly, that Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was already shot forth successfully. As such, Chu Feng simply could not escape from it.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, that enormous sword reached Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. Ear-piercing rumbles exploded in midair, shaking the surroundings.</p><p>The martial skill this time around was countless times more powerful than the one Kong Zheng had used earlier. Being struck by it head-on, Chu Feng would undoubtedly die.</p><p>However, at that moment, Kong Zheng did not have a confident expression.</p><p>He retrieved his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and continued to stare at that empty region of space before him. After a short moment, he began to gnash his teeth furiously.</p><p>Then, he raised his head toward the sky and shouted loudly, &#x201C;Chu Feng, even if you are able to escape today, you will not be able to enter the Hundred Refinements Stage! You are destined to be defeated in this competition!!!&#x201D;</p><p>His furious voice exploded in the sky like ten thousand thunderbolts.</p><p>Even though Kong Zheng had not managed to receive a response from Chu Feng, he was certain that Chu Feng did not die.</p><p>Kong Zheng was so furious because he had used his strongest attack, yet was still unable to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>After all, in the battle today, he had been injured by Chu Feng. Furthermore&#x2026; he knew very well that if he had not possessed his protective treasure, he would most likely have been killed by Chu Feng.</p><p>To the extremely egotistical Kong Zheng, this was simply a disgrace, an enormous humiliation that he could not possibly tolerate!!!</p><p>Unfortunately, he had no choice but to endure it. That was why he did not dare to become enraged.</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>As for Chu Feng, it was true that he had survived. While it was true that Kong Zheng&#x2019;s strength surpassed his own, Kong Zheng was only a single level of cultivation above him.</p><p>Faced with an expert that was only a level of cultivation above him, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Five Elements Secret Skill&#x2019;s undying and indestructible body would be effective.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that fellow&#x2019;s status in the Kong Heavenly Clan is not low. He actually possessed such a protective treasure.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If he didn&apos;t have the treasure, he would already be dead. Thus, you were actually the victor in that confrontation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To win from a position of weakness, boy, you&#x2019;ve done it beautifully,&#x201D; On the journey, Her Lady Queen was praising Chu Feng nonstop.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that it is still Milady Queen who is concerned about me the most,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a very happy smile.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you talking about? This Queen is merely praising you. How did it turn into being concerned about you?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s shapely eyebrows rose slightly as she spoke to Chu Feng in a slightly puzzled manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Although that Kong Zheng possessed the protection of a treasure, it remains that it is his treasure. Thus, it could be considered to be his ability.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As the person who fled was me, the person that was defeated would naturally also be me. Milady Queen, it is clear that you said all those things so that I wouldn&apos;t overthink things, fearing that my ego would be setback by this defeat,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your nonsense. You are such a thick-skinned individual, how could you possibly receive a setback? This Queen refuses to believe you,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen raised her chin in a proud manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, an explanation merely serves as a concealment, a concealment means that what is said is the truth. You don&#x2019;t have to say anything. I understand your kind intentions,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Pah! You&#x2019;re thinking too much,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen curled her lips.</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>On their journey, Chu Feng and Eggy chatted nonstop. The ruckus managed to calm Chu Feng&#x2019;s state of mind.</p><p>This was Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s charm. With Her Lady Queen accompanying him, regardless of what sort of situation Chu Feng might find himself in, he would never feel loneliness.</p><p>Although he was chatting with Her Lady Queen the entire way, Chu Feng had not forgotten the purpose of his journey. His Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings had been activated the entire time. After increasing his cultivation to its strongest level, Chu Feng stood atop the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique and was flying toward the Hundred Refinements Stage with his fastest speed.</p><p>It was a race against time. He had to obtain the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone before Kong Zheng.</p><p>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng finally arrived at his destination, the Hundred Refinements Stage.</p><p>The Hundred Refinements Stage was enveloped by an enormous spirit formation. That spirit formation looked like an extremely enormous fort situated aboveground. One simply could not see through the spirit formation or determine what was inside the Hundred Refinements Stage. The only thing visible was that grand formation.</p><p>&#x201C;This spirit formation is extremely powerful. Chu Feng, are you really able to enter it using that key of yours?&#x201D; Upon seeing the fort before them, Her Lady Queen started to frown.</p><p>Her intuition told her that the spirit formation before them was an impregnable fort. At the very least, with Chu Feng&#x2019;s current strength, it would simply be impossible for him to break through it.</p><p>When Her Lady Queen had that sort of feeling, how could Chu Feng not feel that way too? Actually, at that moment, Chu Feng was even more worried than Her Lady Queen. After all, obtaining that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone concerned the lives of his brother and friend.</p><p>&#x201C;As for whether or not we can enter this place, it&#x2019;ll be up to you,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the key his father gave him and placed it directly on the wall of the seemingly impregnable fort.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Once the spirit formation key came into contact with the fort, it was immediately sucked into the fort with an enormous suction force.</p><p>Seeing that scene, Chu Feng felt joy in his heart. It meant that the spirit formation key was effective. At the very least, it possessed an obvious connection with the Hundred Refinements Stage&#x2019;s grand formation.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s state of joy only lasted for a short while before disappearing. It was replaced with deep worry.</p><p>The reason for that was because, after some time passed, that spirit formation key did not emit enormous spirit power.</p><p>Not to mention opening the fort, after it was sucked into the fort, there was no change whatsoever.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
