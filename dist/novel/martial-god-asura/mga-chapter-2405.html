<p><strong> Chapter 2405 - Extremely Alarmed</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Elder Yuehua, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian and Kong Moyu asked in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;An abnormality has once again arisen from the Grief Calamity Mountain Range&#x2019;s spirit formation! That intruder has managed to open something in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range!!!&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said.</p><p>&#x201C;What?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the people present all revealed an enormous change in expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Yuehua, are you certain that something has been opened, that it is not that intruder triggering a slaughtering formation?&#x201D; Kong Moyu asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I am certain that it is not a slaughtering formation. However, it is indeed a spirit formation. Merely&#x2026; that spirit formation has been broken through by the intruder,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A sudden clap of thunder.</p><p>The crowd from the Kong Heavenly Clan present felt as if they were struck by an invisible lightning strike. They felt as if their bodies had been split open, and their souls struck.</p><p>The Grief Calamity Mountain Range was the place where their Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s primogenitor had hidden his inheritance. That inheritance could be said to be the most precious item for their Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>If they were able to obtain the inheritance, it would mean that their Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s inheritance would be completely intact. At that time, it might even be possible for their Kong Heavenly Clan to surpass the other three tier one powers and become the strongest power in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Over all these years, countless seniors of their Kong Heavenly Clan had entered the Grief Calamity Mountain Range for the sake of the inheritance. However, all of them ended up in failure, and the great majority even lost their lives in there.</p><p>Yet now, an outsider had not only intruded into their Grief Calamity Mountain Range, but also actually managed to open up a spirit formation too.</p><p>What sort of spirit formation was that? What if it was the spirit formation to the inheritance?</p><p>If that was the case, wouldn&#x2019;t it mean that the last inheritance of their Kong Heavenly Clan would be snatched away by an outsider?</p><p>Intolerable. To the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan, this was absolutely intolerable.</p><p>&#x201C;Damned bastard!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Panic. Upon thinking of how their Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s inheritance might be snatched away by an outsider, each and every person from the Kong Heavenly Clan was filled with endless anger. However, they were at a loss as to what to do.</p><p>That was their Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s possession! That was the inheritance left for them by their Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s primogenitor! How could they allow an outsider to snatch it away from them?</p><p>&#x201C;Do you all believe what I said now?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian swept his gaze across the crowd. Then, he began to walk out. He was planning to guard the entrance of the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. He planned to wait for the intruder to exit and confront him at that time.</p><p>&#x201C;That intruder&#x2019;s crimes cannot be forgiven!&#x201D; As Kong Moyu spoke, he also began to walk out. As matters stood, he now planned to join hands with Kong Shunlian even without Kong Shunlian saying anything.</p><p>The reason for that was because he had no choice but to take the intruder seriously now.</p><p>&#x201C;What!!!&#x201D; Right at that moment, Kong Yuehua&#x2019;s gaze suddenly changed, and incomparable shock appeared in her eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be, h-how is this possible?!&#x201D; Kong Yuehua&#x2019;s eyes were fixed tightly onto the spirit formation, with an expression of disbelief on her face.</p><p>Seeing Kong Yuehua&#x2019;s expression, even Kong Shunlian and Kong Moyu hurriedly stopped their footsteps and returned to ask, &#x201C;Elder Yuehua, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201D;</p><p>The three of them had known one another since their youth. Thus, they knew what sort of character Kong Yuehua was. All these years, they rarely ever saw Kong Yuehua reveal such an astonished expression.</p><p>Yet, during this moment of crisis, Kong Yuehua actually revealed such an expression.</p><p>As such, the two of them realized one thing from merely Kong Yuehua&#x2019;s expression.</p><p>That is, the abnormal movement of the spirit formation was absolutely no small matter right now. Perhaps something even more serious was happening.</p><p>&#x201C;According to the illustration of the spirit formation, the person who has managed to open that spirit formation in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range right now is a member of the younger generation who is not even a hundred years old,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said.</p><p>&#x201C;Member of the younger generation?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re saying that a member of the younger generation has managed to intrude into our Grief Calamity Mountain Range, and even managed to open a certain spirit formation on top of that?&#x201D; Hearing those words, even Kong Shunlian and Kong Moyu revealed astonished expressions.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Yuehua, are you sure you saw it correctly?&#x201D; Kong Moyu asked. He felt this matter to be impossible.</p><p>&#x201C;Although this spirit formation has rarely ever showed an abnormal change in all these years, I have studied how to observe this spirit formation since I was a child. As such, I can tell what is happening in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range from the abnormal changes to this spirit formation with certainty.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, there is no mistake. The spirit formation&#x2019;s abnormal changes will not be mistaken, nor will my readings of it be mistaken.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The intruder is definitely a member of the younger generation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The only thing I do not understand is why he only revealed that he is a member of the younger generation now,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said with an astonished expression. She, who had always been calm, was unable to contain herself when she spoke those words to the point that even her tone had changed.</p><p>&#x201C;I think what cannot be understood the most right now is not who that person of the younger generation might be, but rather how he managed to obtain such an otherworldly ability to intrude upon the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. This is not something that a person of the younger generation from our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm can accomplish,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Utmost Exalted Elder, could you mean&#x2026;?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the others revealed increasingly frightened expressions.</p><p>&#x201C;Likely, the intruder is a genius from the Upper Realms,&#x201D; Kong Shunlian said.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Merely that one sentence caused the crowd to turn pale. In fact, some people even started to involuntarily tremble.</p><p>What sort of existence would an Upper Realm&#x2019;s genius be? Not to mention his strength, merely his background should be extremely frightening.</p><p>Regardless of how powerful their Kong Heavenly Clan might be in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they could not contend against the powers from the Upper Realms.</p><p>If they must be compared, then the disparity between them would be akin to that of heaven from earth.</p><p>An existence from the Upper Realms was something that they could not afford to offend.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;...</p><p>At the same time. Chu Feng was still in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. Furthermore, by undoing that spirit formation, Chu Feng had successfully opened the entrance.</p><p>After that entrance was opened, a spirit formation vortex appeared. A gate was slowly opening inside the spirit formation vortex.</p><p>This gate was eight meters wide and ten meters tall. It was very simple and unadorned. Yet, at the same time, it was very extraordinary. Although it appeared to be made of stone, it was still extremely imposing and domineering.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve finally succeeded.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng felt very happy as he saw the gate before him. However, it was very difficult for him to smile. The reason for that was because he was still worried.</p><p>&#x201C;Merely&#x2026; my concealment formation has disappeared. I wonder&#x2026; has my identity already been exposed?&#x201D; Chu Feng wondered worriedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Since it has already come down to this, there is no way to back out anymore. Thus, don&#x2019;t worry about it, and enter that place first,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said excitedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he pushed the gate open.</p><p>Although the gate was floating in midair, after Chu Feng pushed it open, what appeared before him was a world spirit entrance.</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, Chu Feng entered the world spirit entrance. After entering it, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body disappeared into the spirit formation.</p><p>As for that gate, it slowly shut itself. Then, it slowly descended back into the spirit formation vortex.</p><p>Soon, the region returned to the way it was before, calm and serene.</p><p>It was as if Chu Feng had never been there, as if the spirit formation had never been opened, as if nothing had happened here.</p><p>At the same time. In the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s ancient pagoda, the crowd were still in a state of astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;Gone,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua suddenly declared.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s gone?&#x201D; Kong Shunlian and Kong Moyu asked in unison.</p><p>&#x201C;The intruder is gone. Completely gone. All abnormality has disappeared,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said as she looked at the spirit formation before her.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that the intruder was killed?&#x201D; Kong Moyu asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s possible that the intruder was killed. However, it&#x2019;s also possible that the intruder escaped. Furthermore, there&#x2019;s another possibility. That is&#x2026; the intruder has managed to enter the place of Lord Primogenitor&#x2019;s inheritance that was left for us,&#x201D; Kong Yuehua said.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D; At that moment, Kong Moyu shouted angrily. Then, he let out an extremely frightening aura. While emitting that frightening aura, he flew out and instantly disappeared. Only his frightening aura continued to linger in that place.</p><p>He had gone to the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. He was afraid that the intruder would escape the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. Thus, he was going to the entrance of the Grief Calamity Mountain Range to stop the intruder from escaping.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
