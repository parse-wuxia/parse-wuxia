<p><strong> Chapter 2447 - Telling The Truth</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Lord Father, why were you so alarmed?&#x201D; Zhan Lingling asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d heard that you and your younger brother were both captured by the Monstrous Clan. As such, how could I not be anxious?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said.</p><p>&#x201C;I was indeed captured by Yao Liutian. But, how could my younger brother be captured by the Monstrous Clan?&#x201D; Zhan Lingling revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t that Chu Feng the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s spy? Didn&#x2019;t he capture Lingtong?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked. As he spoke, he took a deliberate glance at Chu Feng, who was standing atop the head of the azure dragon.</p><p>After all, he knew everyone else present. The only unfamiliar face was Chu Feng. Thus, he determined with a single glance that that sole remaining individual was Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Father, where did you hear that nonsense? Not only is big brother Chu Feng my savior, he is also big sister&#x2019;s savior. How could he possibly be the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s spy? Look at his hand, do you see what he is holding?&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong said in a very excited manner.</p><p>After all, to him, Chu Feng was truly his idol right now. As such, he would naturally not allow anyone to slander Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;That is?!&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing what Zhan Lingtong said, the crowd realized that Chu Feng was actually holding a head.</p><p>As for that head, it was actually the head of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Martial Ancestor-level expert, Yao Liutian.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve killed Yao Liutian?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief revealed an astonished expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Father, he was the one to save me from Yao Liutian. He was also the one to kill Yao Liutian. I personally witnessed it,&#x201D; Before Chu Feng could answer, Zhan Lingling answered for him.</p><p>&#x201C;A talent! Never would I have expected that there would be such a talent among our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s citizens. Why have I never heard of you before?&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had an ecstatic expression on his face.</p><p>After all, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief knew very well what sort of character Yao Liutian was. To be able to kill Yao Liutian, this meant that Chu Feng was very powerful.</p><p>Right now, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan and the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan were battling one another. The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan had been slowly forced to retreat in defeat by the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan. As such, they were at the point when they needed talented people the most.</p><p>To discover a human that is capable of killing Yao Liutian at such a time, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief would naturally be extremely overjoyed.</p><p>&#x201C;Father, you are overthinking things. Benefactor Chu Feng is not a citizen of our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan. Rather, I&#x2019;m afraid that his origin will startle you,&#x201D; Zhan Lingling said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? What sort of origin might he have to be able to startle me? There&#x2019;s no harm in mentioning it,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had a smile on his face.</p><p>However, it was more of a joking smile. After all, the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain was only so big, and only contained so many clans. Thus, no matter how extraordinary one&#x2019;s origin might be, it would not be as amazing as their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Benefactor Chu Feng is from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; Zhan Lingling said.</p><p>&#x201C;Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Once those four words were said, not to mention the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, even Zhan Quezhi and the others had an enormous change in expression.</p><p>The reason for that was because the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm possessed an extraordinary significance to them.</p><p>It was precisely because it was so extraordinary that the great majority of the people showed that they did not believe it after a moment of shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Benefactor, I am sorry to inconvenience you. However, could you please display your special abilities? Else&#x2026; I fear that my father and the others will not believe that you&#x2019;re from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; Zhan Lingling said to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Zzzzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, lightning flashed in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. Then, his Thunder Armor covered his body, and his Thunder Wings extended out from his back.</p><p>It was a dazzling sight. It was as if Chu Feng&#x2019;s lightning was brightening the entire region.</p><p>However, the crowd was most astonished by Chu Feng&#x2019;s current cultivation.</p><p>Chu Feng had not concealed his cultivation. Rather, for the sake of displaying his strength, Chu Feng had unleashed his aura without any reservations.</p><p>A cultivation of rank two Martial Ancestor and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. This was&#x2026; the strength that Chu Feng currently possessed.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing, truly amazing.&#x201D;</p><p>The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was convinced. The special ability that Chu Feng displayed, as well as his heaven-defying battle power, were all not things that ordinary commoners possessed.</p><p>This was especially true for Chu Feng&#x2019;s lightning power. Even their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan did not possess that power. Thus, he was certain that Chu Feng was not someone from their War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain.</p><p>&#x201C;Never would I have expected that an expert from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would come to our assistance. This is truly a blessing to our Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was overjoyed. The way he saw it, this was simply the will of the Heavens, that it was the Heavens that was trying to help their Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;But, since we&#x2019;re of the same side, why did you injure Quezhi?&#x201D; As the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief said those words, he looked to Zhan Lingtong&#x2019;s brother-in-law.</p><p>According to Zhan Quezhi, Chu Feng was trying to capture Zhan Lingtong. For the sake of protecting Zhan Lingtong from being captured, he was injured by Chu Feng.</p><p>However, what sort of existence was the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief? As matters stood, he already knew that the truth was not as Zhan Quezhi had said to him earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, I was mistaken. This is all a misunderstanding,&#x201D; In response, Zhan Quezhi hurriedly spoke to explain himself.</p><p>&#x201C;I did not ask you. Do not interrupt,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shut him down coldly.</p><p>Zhan Quezhi hurriedly closed his mouth. However, he had a very ugly expression on his face. Fear was flickering in his eyes.</p><p>After all, he would be truly humiliated if the truth was to be declared. He truly did not wish for the Lord Clan Chief to discover the truth.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that it would not be trustworthy for me to tell you why I beat him. Why not ask your clansmen why I beat him?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Once Chu Feng said those words, Zhan Quezhi revealed a joyous expression. After all, everyone from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan was on his side.</p><p>He believed that none of his fellow clansmen would attack him for the sake of an outsider like Chu Feng.</p><p>Perhaps the truth would be buried just like this.</p><p>Sure enough, it was as Zhan Quezhi expected, none of the people from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan wanted to offend him. In fact, none of them dared to offend him.</p><p>Thus, at that moment, all of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&apos;s men lowered their heads. None of them wanted to tell the truth of what had happened back then.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Witnessing that scene, Zhan Quezhi revealed a pleased expression. In fact, he even cast a provocative glance at Chu Feng.</p><p>He seemed to be stating with his gaze &#x2018;So what if you&#x2019;re from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm? This is my territory here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You want to fight with me? You&#x2019;re not qualified at all.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201C;Father, I know about what happened back then. I can tell you what happened,&#x201D; Right at that moment, Zhan Lingtong stood forth.</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D;</p><p>When Zhan Quezhi saw that his expression immediately changed. The complacence he had displayed earlier disappeared in an instant. At that moment, his expression was uglier than someone who had eaten dog feces.</p><p>He never expected that the person to betray him at such a time would be his wife&#x2019;s younger brother, his own brother-in-law.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, tell me what happened,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Earlier, big brother Chu Feng and I rescued a lot of our clan&#x2019;s citizens on our way back. Originally, I planned to bring them into our clan to offer them temporary shelter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, brother-in-law was against it the entire time. In fact, he even tried to attack big brother Chu Feng because of that. Fortunately, I tried my best to stop them. Else, with the strength that big brother Chu Feng possesses, it is obvious what would happen if they were to truly fight,&#x201D; Zhan Lingtong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lingtong, what sort of nonsense are you spouting?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing till that point, Zhan Quezhi&#x2019;s expression had already turned deathly white from fury. He truly never expected that his own brother-in-law would speak for an outsider, speak for that Chu Feng, at such a crucial time.</p><p>He spoke because he wanted his brother-in-law to stop while he could. He didn&#x2019;t want Zhan Lingtong to continue.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother-in-law, I am merely telling the truth,&#x201D; However, Zhan Lingtong did not have the slightest intention of stopping.</p><p>&#x201C;Lingtong, you&#x2026;&#x201D; Zhan Quezhi was so furious that he felt as if he was about to vomit blood.</p><p>&#x201C;You shut up!&#x201D; Right at that moment, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shouted once again.</p><p>This time around, even though Zhan Quezhi was very unreconciled, he had no choice but to shut his mouth again. The reason for that was because he was able to tell that their Lord Clan Chief was truly angered.</p><p>Merely, he truly could not understand why his own brother-in-law would be helping Chu Feng.</p><p>That said, even though Zhang Quezhi started to panic, he had not become extremely panicky.</p><p>The way he saw it, even if Zhan Lingtong were to help Chu Feng, it would still only be words spoken by a single person.</p><p>As long as the others present did not testify against him, he would still be able to argue that such a thing had never happened.</p><p>Furthermore, he was confident that the others would not testify against him.</p><p>After all, the remaining clansmen did not dare to go against him.</p><p>As for his wife, she had always been very affectionate toward him.</p><p>As such, he felt that she would also not speak on behalf of an outsider.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
