<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1070 - Frightening Pressure</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Look over there, isn&#x2019;t that the brat from the Southern Cyanwood Forest? He actually had the courage to challenge the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond&#x2019;s deepest region?&#x201D;</p><p>In an instant, a large number of people had left the center of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond, which made it so that it would be a lot easier to recognize the people who remained. When a disciple from the Orion Monastery discovered that Chu Feng had stayed, he immediately began to mock and ridicule Chu Feng.</p><p>Regardless of what sort of attitude their elders had shown to the Southern Cyanwood Forest, these disciples had looked down upon the Southern Cyanwood Forest from the bottom of their hearts. This sort of contempt was deep-rooted. On top of that, Chu Feng had a small skirmish with them earlier. Thus, they would definitely not let the opportunity to mock Chu Feng go by.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s truly a disciple from the Southern Cyanwood Forest. He seemed to be the one who had insulted the Black Python Stronghold&#x2019;s chief.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It had already been many years since someone from the Southern Cyanwood Forest dared to challenge this place. This disciple seemed to be extraordinary.&#x201D;</p><p>The people from the Orion Monastery deliberately shouted with very loud voices when they discovered Chu Feng. Thus, this led to the attention of others. Merely, when they discovered Chu Feng, they did not act the same as those from the Orion Monastery. Instead of ridiculing him, they were actually looking forward to his performance.</p><p>That was because ever since the matter with the Black Python Stronghold, they had looked up to Chu Feng with a whole new level of respect and felt that he was an extraordinary disciple. Moreover, the skirmish with the Orion Monastery earlier as well as his decision to stay here to challenge this location had brought about even more of a favorable impression and expectations from the surrounding crowd. They did not look down upon or loathe Chu Feng in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh.&#x201D; Right at this moment, from the lotus flower warship, the figure that was standing alongside the old man who had spoken earlier suddenly jumped out from the warship and landed into the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh. Woosh. Woosh. Woosh. Woosh.&#x201D; Following that, the six hundred figures on top of the warship began to jump off of it and land in the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond in succession.</p><p>Their falling speed was extremely fast. However, they did not bring about any splash of water when they landed into it. It was as if they were one with the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond&#x2019;s water to begin with. Gentle yet beautiful, their display had brought about astonishment and exclaim from the crowd.</p><p>At this moment, only a single figure remained on the warship. It was the old man who had spoken earlier. He did not jump down to the water. Instead, he looked to the crowd below and said,</p><p>&#x201C;I know that the matters regarding the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle are known among you humans and monstrous beasts. I also know that many people do not believe them to be true and feel that they were merely lies that were created by us, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I am able to tell you all that it is the truth. The Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle is indeed capable of releasing lightning that would cover the entire sky of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond after being triggered. Moreover, depending on who it is that triggered it, the color of the lightning released would also be different.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Are they truly all real?&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, the crowd burst into an uproar. Although the matter regarding the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle was rumored for many years, there were also people who did not believe in it. For the majority of them, they actually felt that it was fake.</p><p>Yet today, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves had confirmed that this matter was true. This caused those people who already believed it to be the truth to believe in it even more and those who did not believe in it to begin with to become skeptical.</p><p>At this moment, many people inside the Immortal Pond were getting fired up. Especially Yuan Qing, Qin Guang and others who were confident in themselves. Impatience was written all over their faces. For these people, what they wanted to do was not to win honor for the human race or the monstrous beasts. Instead, they knew that they would become famous if they managed to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle and in turn brighten up their future.</p><p>&#x201C;I know that you all from the human race and the monstrous beast race wish badly to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. I could also tell that some among you have already grown impatient. I am able to tell you all the method of triggering the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle. As long as you&#x2019;re able to reach the deepest region of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond and persist in that place for a mere moment, you would be able to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If all three races managed to reach the deepest region of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond, then it would be determined by who would be able to persist in that region for the longest. The Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle would be triggered by the person who persists in the deepest region for the longest.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have already told you all the method. As for whether you&#x2019;ll be able to trigger the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Needle, that would all depend on your own abilities. However, I must remind you all that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond&#x2019;s deepest region is not a place that anyone could enter as they please. Many people have died in there.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Soon, the power from the depths of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond would reach the surface of the water. You all, experience that for yourselves first. See if you&#x2019;re able to persist in that energy for an hour before trying to dive into the water. However, the deeper you reach, the more powerful the power would be. It would be best for you all to assess your own capabilities and act accordingly. Otherwise, if an accident was to happen to you, we, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, would not take any responsibility.&#x201D; Said that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf.</p><p>&#x201C;Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Not long after that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf finished explaining to the crowd, strange sounds started to come from the bottom of where Chu Feng and the others were floating. Soon, a large amount of bubbles started to rush forth from the bottom.</p><p>Finally, the bubbles reached the surface of the water. At this moment, at the region of water where Chu Feng and the others were at, the water began to flare up like boiling water.</p><p>At this moment, many people began to display expressions of pain. There were even people who hurriedly leaped out of the water, leaving this region of water.</p><p>That was because, at this moment, a frightening pressure appeared in that region of water. That pressure was not something that ordinary people could endure. As for that pressure, it was the power from the depths of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Immortal Pond that that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf had mentioned.</p><p>At this moment, other than a small portion of people who were taking this opportunity to train and not bother with what was going on, the majority of the people were frozen in their original location with their gazes on Chu Feng and the others. They wanted to know exactly how many people would be able to persist under that sort of pressure for an hour as well as who these people were.</p><p>Time slowly passed. It appeared to be extremely long and slow. This was especially true to the people inside that region of water. It was simply an enormous torment.</p><p>In that sort of condition, there was a continuous flow of people leaving that region of water. Some hurriedly swam out from the center region. Some hurriedly soared to the sky. There were also some who were unable to persist but still stubbornly continued only to end up losing consciousness while puking out foam from their mouths and ended up being saved by others.</p><p>Finally, an hour had passed. Of the close to five hundred people that had stayed behind, only twenty-five remained.</p><p>Of these twenty-five people, five were monstrous beasts. At the very least, five among them had already turned into their monstrous beast forms. Although their monstrous beast forms were a bit unsightly, it remains that the monstrous beast&#x2019;s true form were their strongest form.</p><p>As for the remaining twenty people, ten among them were disciples of the Orion Monastery. This number had reconfirmed to the people that the Orion Monastery was the overlord of this region that possessed an unwavering position.</p><p>Other than the disciples of the Orion Monastery, there were ten other people remaining. There were men, women, old and young among these ten people. The youths were from famous families. As for the old ones, they were famous experts. However, there was an exception -- Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;That disciple of the Southern Cyanwood Forest actually managed to persevere.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Inconceivable! No wonder Headmaster Sikong would shield him like so. So it was because that this child is actually extraordinary.&#x201D;</p><p>The twenty-five people that managed to persist in the pressure for an hour became the focus of everyone&#x2019;s attention. As for the person who was the main focus of everyone&#x2019;s attention, it was Chu Feng. His status as a disciple of the Southern Cyanwood Forest had brought about shock to the others.</p><p>At the very least, at this moment, the number of people discussing Chu Feng had surpassed that of Yuan Qing and Qin Guang. This brought about great displeasure to the disciples of the Orion Monastery. Especially that Yuan Qing and Qin Guang, there were traces of chilliness in their eyes.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
