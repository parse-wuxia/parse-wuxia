<p><strong> Chapter 1957 - Must Kill!</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Stop!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, an angry shout suddenly sounded from above the skies. Following that voice, a figure appeared.</p><p>It was an Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf. He possessed white hair and an aged appearance. With wrinkles covering his face, he appeared to be extremely old.</p><p>However, his cultivation was very strong. He was a rank six Martial Emperor. Furthermore, his gaze was extremely fierce and filled with killing intent as he looked to Chu Feng.</p><p>Upon seeing this man, Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze grew colder. The anger on his face increased.</p><p>Chu Feng had never met that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf before. However, he knew for certain that he was related to Xian Yuyin. Else, he would not be helping Xian Yuyin.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng grew even angrier was because that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf held a man in either hand. They were his good brother Zhang Tianyi and Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s father, Zhang Ming.</p><p>At that moment, both Zhang Tianyi and Zhang Ming were covered in blood and their auras were extremely weak. It was as if they might die at any moment.</p><p>Not only did Xian Yuyin defeat Zhang Tianyi, he had also really tormented Zhang Tianyi. In fact, even Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s father Zhang Ming was implicated.</p><p>&#x201C;What insolence!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, Chu Feng was filled with overflowing anger. The hand which he had pierced into Xian Yuyin suddenly clenched. His martial power began to ravage Xian Yuyin from within.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahh!!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Uncle, save me, save me!!!&#x201D; Xian Yuyin started to shout.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, stop immediately. Otherwise, I will kill Zhang Tianyi and his father,&#x201D; Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s uncle shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;What? They are Zhang Tianyi and his father?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After defeating Zhang Tianyi, Xian Yuyin even captured Zhang Tianyi after? Isn&#x2019;t this too excessive?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t it only sparring? Why would they be tormented to such a state? Furthermore, he even involved his father?&#x201D;</p><p>After knowing that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf was holding Zhang Tianyi and his father, many people began to feel disgusted with Xian Yuyin.</p><p>In fact, when Xian Yuyin had killed many innocent people with his slash, he had already lost the favor of the people.</p><p>&#x201C;Release them. Otherwise, I will kill Xian Yuyin on the spot,&#x201D; Chu Feng said coldly. His each and every word was said with fuming rage between gritted teeth.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill Yuyin? You dare?! Yuyin is our Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; Young Master. You dare kill him?! If you kill him, not even ten thousand of you would be enough to make up for his death!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I dare to guarantee you that if you do not release Yuyin right now, I will immediately make Zhang Tianyi and his father meet miserable deaths,&#x201D; That old man said with a ferocious appearance.</p><p>&#x201C;Puu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng suddenly pulled out his palm. Then, he ruthlessly pierced it back into Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s dantian. He said, &#x201C;I do not know whether or not you will kill them. However, if you do not do as I say, I will definitely kill Xian Yuyin.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Uncle! Release them! Release them!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He really will kill me! I don&#x2019;t want to die!!&#x201D;</p><p>Shockingly, Xian Yuyin was crying. He was crying not only because of the pain from Chu Feng&#x2019;s torment. Most importantly, it was because he felt that his cultivation was rapidly fleeing away. He felt as if his heart was bleeding.</p><p>That was his cultivation that he had painstakingly trained.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll release them, I&#x2019;ll release them,&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng had started to torment Xian Yuyin, that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf started to panic. He ended up having no choice but to throw Zhang Tianyi and his father to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior brother Zhang, senior Zhang, are you two okay?&#x201D; Chu Feng hurriedly asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, we are fine,&#x201D; Zhang Tianyi&#x2019;s father said with a weak voice.</p><p>As for Zhang Tianyi, he smiled. However, he did not say anything.</p><p>However, that action from him caused Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart to tighten. Chu Feng felt enormous pain.</p><p>He knew that it was not that Zhang Tianyi did not wish to say anything. Rather, he was unable to speak. His tongue had truly been cut off by Xian Yuyin.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng turned to the sky and shouted angrily. That voice of his was so ear-piercing that not only did the ground start to quake, even the void itself began to tremble.</p><p>Chu Feng was truly enraged. However, he knew that he could not kill Xian Yuyin. No matter what, Xian Yuyin was still an Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf.</p><p>Finally, Chu Feng stopped his shouting. He forced a smile onto his face and said to Zhang Tianyi, &#x201C;Senior brother Zhang, senior Zhang, I will not have you two suffer in vain.&#x201D;</p><p>After he finished saying those words, ruthlessness flashed through Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. Then, with sudden strength in his arm, he thrust his entire arm through Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;Puuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s mouth opened wide, and he sprayed out a mouthful of blood. Then, with a &#x2018;putt,&#x2019; he crashed to the ground. He no longer possessed any breath.</p><p>Dead. Xian Yuyin was dead.</p><p>Killed. He had been killed by Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng knew that he possessed a lot of reasons as to why he could not kill Xian Yuyin.</p><p>However, when he saw his own brother and senior being tormented to such a state by Xian Yuyin, Chu Feng was unable to find any reason not to kill him.</p><p>Thus, today, he had to kill Xian Yuyin.</p><p>&#x201C;Noo!!!!!!!!!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing Xian Yuyin being killed by Chu Feng, that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf let out a snarl filled with incomparable anger.</p><p>&#x201C;Catch,&#x201D; As for Chu Feng, he suddenly lifted his leg and kicked both Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s corpse as well as the Imperial Armament he had been holding to that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf.</p><p>Then, holding Zhang Tianyi with one hand and Zhang Ming with his other, he unleashed his Azure Dragon Dashing Technique and began to escape.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I will dismember your body into ten thousand pieces today!!!&#x201D; After catching Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s corpse and the Imperial Armament, that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf did not plan to let Chu Feng get away. Instead, he began to chase after Chu Feng.</p><p>Not only did he unleash all of his strength, he also unleashed their Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; special bloodline&#x2019;s power. He was determined to kill Chu Feng.</p><p>Actually, if Chu Feng wanted to kill him, he was totally capable of doing so. Even though a rank six Martial Emperor was very strong, Chu Feng possessed the Qilin Arrow that was capable of killing even rank seven Martial Emperors.</p><p>However, as he had already killed Xian Yuyin, Chu Feng did not wish to kill another Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf. After all&#x2026; the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves had treated him very well. Even if they had done something unforgivable, Chu Feng knew that Xian Yuyin was the main offender.</p><p>Thus, to Chu Feng, killing Xian Yuyin was already sufficient. He did not have the need to kill this Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf too.</p><p>As for why Chu Feng did not reveal his Qilin Arrow to scare that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf, it was because he felt that that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf had already been driven mad with Xian Yuyin&#x2019;s death. Thus, he would not be able to scare him with his Qilin Arrow. As Chu Feng did not wish to kill him, the only thing he could do was run away.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve done nothing wrong. Thus, why flee?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, a silhouette suddenly appeared before Chu Feng.</p><p>Upon seeing this person, Chu Feng immediately revealed a joyous expression. This person&#x2026; was the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.</p><p>At that moment, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had a smile on his face. He walked over to Chu Feng&#x2019;s back and stopped the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf who was chasing after him.</p><p>&#x201C;Scram!!!&#x201D; That Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf was most definitely someone that knew the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. However, as he had already lost his ability to reason, he did not care about the Weaponry Refinement Immortal at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Scram!!!&#x201D; However, when that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf reached the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal waved his sleeve and brought forth a strong gale. That gale directly blew that Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf away.</p><p>Before the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, that rank six Martial Emperor Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elf was actually unable to withstand a single attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank seven Martial Emperor?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng was shocked upon sensing the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&#x2019;s aura. He had never expected that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal would actually be stronger than even the YinYang Immortal. He was actually a rank seven Martial Emperor.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
