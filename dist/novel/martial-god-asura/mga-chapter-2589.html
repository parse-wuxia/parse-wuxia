I have also concealed my own identity,&#x201D; The guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized why the guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief had to distance himself from Kong Shunlian and Kong Yuehua when telling Chu Feng these things.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evidently, even the two of them had no idea that this mysterious True Immortal-level expert was actually the clan chief of the guardian clan in charge of guarding the Hundred Refinements Stage.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Senior, I am actually no longer a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing what Chu Feng said, the guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief was slightly startled. Then, he said, &#x201C;This subordinate has no idea what happened between Young Master Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan. However, it remains that the blood that flows through Young Master Chu Feng is the Chu Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s blood. In the eyes of this subordinate, you are my master.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;In that case, how did you find out that I am from the Chu Heavenly Clan?

Ever since that day, this subordinate has been secretly protecting Young Master Chu Feng. I have done so all the way up to two years ago, when the Kong Heavenly Clan attacked Young Master Chu Feng,&#x201D; The guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief said.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Senior, I have truly troubled you,&#x201D; Chu Feng felt very grateful. After all, Chu Feng and the guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief had only encountered each other once. Yet, the guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief was able to treat him like this. From this, it could be seen how loyal and devoted the guardian clan was toward the Chu Heavenly Clan.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Putt~~~&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief kneeled onto the ground. He said, &#x201C;Young Master Chu Feng, please don&#x2019;t address this subordinate as &#x2018;senior&#x2019; anymore. This subordinate isn&apos;t qualified for such respect.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Quickly get up,&#x201D; Chu Feng hurriedly helped the guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief back up. He said, &#x201C;If you consider me your master, then listen to me. From today onwards, you are to address me as Chu Feng. And I&#x2026; will address you as senior.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; The guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief started to hesitate.&#xA0;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Else&#x2026; you do not have to continue to protect me.&#x201D;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;No matter how you view me, I do not wish to accept a master and servant relationship.

In that case, I will do as Young Master Chu Feng says. No&#x2026; Chu Feng,&#x201D; The guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief corrected himself.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Senior, can you tell me the situation with Zhao Hong?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; The guardian clan&#x2019;s clan chief nodded.
