<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 778 - What Plan?</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re Wuqing, who defeated the various geniuses from the Misty Peak, and obtained a large number of Martial Markings?&#x201D; said the old man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior, that is me.&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No wonder. I&#x2019;ve heard that you are very skillful with Spirit Formation techniques, and that you can even see through Lady Piaomiao&#x2019;s Map of Unpredictability. You are truly as the rumours say.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, why are the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago chasing after you? Could it be because you took away their glory on the Misty Peak, and thus they hate you for that?&#x201D; asked the old man again.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;No. They are chasing after me because I crippled Zhan Feng, the son of the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s Second Immortal in the core area of the Depraved Ravine. That&#x2019;s why they are doing this,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? You crippled Zhan Feng?&#x201D; All the experts on scene couldn&#x2019;t help but gasping deeply after they heard these words. Their eyes were full of admiration as they looked at Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">They naturally knew who Zhan Feng was. Although his own strength was nothing significant, his father was one of the peak experts in the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet, Chu Feng still dared to cripple Zhan Feng despite of that. They had to admit that they did admire Chu Feng&#x2019;s courage.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;These are your words alone; I do not believe them.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Eighth Brother, Ninth Brother, Tenth Brother, head out and investigate. See if this child&#x2019;s words are true or not. Also, investigate that boy Xuan Xiaochao, and find out whether he&#x2019;s safe or not,&#x201D; said the old man.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yes sir.&#x201D; The three peak Martial Lords had already opened the formation and rose into the air, heading towards the Depraved Ravine.</span></p><p><span style="">After a while, they returned, went up to the old man&#x2019;s side, and quietly informed him of a few things.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng could tell that they were tell him about the results of their investigation. Such as: Chu Feng&#x2019;s words were true&#x2014;he truly crippled the genius from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, Zhan Feng&#x2014;and Murong Xun really did fight Xuan Xiaochao, but there was no news of his current whereabouts&#x2026;</span></p><p><span style="">Something they did not know, however, was shortly after they left, a large number of Immortal Execution Archipelago experts arrived at the mountain range they were hiding within earlier.</span></p><p><span style="">Even Murong Xun, as well as the Ninth Immortal of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, arrived. They seemed to know that there were many experts killed.</span></p><p><span style="">But due to the fact that the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2019;s experts dealt with it perfectly, the Immortal Execution Archipelago could not discover anything. At least, they weren&#x2019;t able to discover who killed the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, I didn&#x2019;t think you would truly be this fearless.&#x201D; At that moment, after hearing the report, the old man chuckled. There was a bit more approval in his eyes as he looked at Chu Feng, then he said, &#x201C;However, Wuqing, my friend, even though you are an enemy to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, you are not a part of my Crippling Night Demon Sect. I still cannot trust you completely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;However, I&#x2019;ve taken quite a liking to you. So, even though you know a few of our secrets, I won&#x2019;t kill you. But, I cannot let you go immediately either. In these days, bear with it and follow us. After the business in this Depraved Ravine is finished, we&#x2019;ll let you go then.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking, the old man waved his sleeve and left with the nine other peak Martial Lords. It seemed they had a few things to take care of.</span></p><p><span style="">And, even though Chu Feng was able to freely move about within the Spirit Formation, the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect kept staring at Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">He, however, did not mind such a situation. He knew very well that the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect were preparing something, so he deduced that they were not the only experts from the Crippling Night Demon Sect that had arrived at the Depraved Ravine. He vaguely knew there was going to be an entertaining show to watch soon&#x2014;a show of the battle between the Immortal Execution Archipelago and Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">From then on, Chu Feng stayed put. The people from Crippling Night Demon Sect didn&#x2019;t treat him badly either; it could even be said he was served with meals abundant with meat. There were even some people who followed Chu Feng and asked him a few things.</span></p><p><span style="">For example, the encounters Chu Feng had within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, and who was Chu Feng&#x2019;s master. Some were just bored out of their minds and started to chat about random matters with Chu Feng, as if they were brothers already.</span></p><p><span style="">Of course, there were two sides to all things. Even though a large fraction of the people liked Chu Feng, there was also a small fraction whose gazes were a bit unkind, even irritated, as they looked at Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">After being together with them for a while, as well as his furtive eavesdropping, Chu Feng learnt of the origin of those people.</span></p><p><span style="">As Chu Feng had guessed, the Crippling Night Demon Sect had indeed sent many experts to the Depraved Ravine. They even sent two Martial Kings.</span></p><p><span style="">These people were even a bit related to Chu Feng: they were old subordinates of Qiu Canfeng, the head of the Four Protectors.</span></p><p><span style="">They were all experts within World Spiritists. What they were most skilled in were Spirit Formation techniques. The ten peak Martial Lords were sworn brothers, and they even had a title within the Crippling Night Demon Sect&#x2014;the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers.</span></p><p><span style="">Although they were peak Martial Lords, many years ago they had already become Gold-cloak World Spiritists. For the head of the ten brothers, everyone called him Old Liu. He had already been at the peak of the Martial Lord realm for dozens of years, and at present, there were signs of the possibility of him making a breakthrough to become a Martial King.</span></p><p><span style="">They bore an extremely important mission coming here this time. As for the specifics, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t know. But regardless, the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect seemed to gather together here today to strike down the arrogant bearing that the Immortal Execution Archipelago emanated. Although the Immortal Execution Archipelago had snuck in, they seemed to have stepped into the trap the Crippling Night Demon Sect laid instead.</span></p><p><span style="">After knowing this, Chu Feng unavoidably felt some intimate feeling towards those people. If he could, Chu Feng really wished he could tell them, &#x201C;</span><i><span style="">I&#x2019;m actually Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s disciple!</span></i><span style="">&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">If he did, however, they would definitely question Chu Feng about Qiu Canfeng&#x2019;s matters, and where exactly he was.</span></p><p><span style="">But, Qiu Canfeng clearly instructed Chu Feng to, other than Fu Liansheng, not tell anyone where he currently was.</span></p><p><span style="">So, after some consideration, Chu Feng just let it be. Putting aside that they didn&#x2019;t really trust him, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t really trust them either.</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, the day of the arranged battle between the disciples of the Three Protectors had arrived. The people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect also started to make their move. They didn&#x2019;t leave Chu Feng behind here, but brought him along as well.</span></p><p><span style="">Chu Feng couldn&#x2019;t help rejoicing because of that, since he could finally personally witness the upcoming good show.</span></p><p><span style="">With the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers leading, they first came to a deep part of a lake. There was a secret passage there, and as they went forth along the passage, they finally arrived at the core region of the Depraved Ravine.</span></p><p><span style="">Although they were underground, deep and hidden, they could see everything outside clearly. That was the power of a Spirit Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">So, Chu Feng could see that there was truly quite a few people gathered at the core of the Depraved Ravine. People formed mountains and oceans outside, and it was extremely lively. No matter in the sky, or on the ground, there were people everywhere. Rough estimations dictated that there were several tens of thousands of people at the very least.</span></p><p><span style="">And that was when the Stone Forest of Death acted as a barrier. If it were not there, one could imagine how many people in the Eastern Sea Region would come here to add into the liveliness.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Let us start.&#x201D; Suddenly, the head of the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, Old Liu, spoke solemnly.</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, everyone subconsciously backed away. Only the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers walked towards the Spirit Formation that sealed the core of the Depraved Ravine.</span></p><p><span style="">The Spirit Formation closed away the outside world. From high in the sky, to deep into the earth, it formed a perfect seal to the core of the Depraved Ravine.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at that very moment, the ten peak Martial Lords seemed to plan to unseal that formation.</span></p><p><span style="">He thought so because Chu Feng saw that the ten Gold-cloak World Spiritists were not only laying an extremely mystical and profound Opening Formation, they also took out large amounts of extremely precious Spirit Formation Stones.</span></p><p><span style="">Although the power contained within the Spirit Formation Stones was limited, they could, within a short period of time, raise the power of their Spirit Formation by many times.</span></p><p><span style="">But even so, doubts involuntarily arose in Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart: &#x201C;Can they open this Spirit Formation with just these things? What exactly are they doing? And what is their plan?&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
