<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1878 - Meeting An Old Friend Again</strong></p><p>Nangong Longjian led the way. He proceeded directly into the Purple Flames Blackmountain&#x2019;s deepest region.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, he was still able to sense an enormous pressure originating from deep underground. The further in they went, the stronger that pressure became.</p><p>Finally, Nangong Longjian stopped, descended to the ground and entered a cave.</p><p>Right after entering the cave, Chu Feng immediately smelled a special fragrance. Merely by this fragrance, Chu Feng was able to tell that someone was tempering their body with a special formation, herbal medicine and natural treasures.</p><p>Chu Feng hurriedly turned his gaze to the Compass Immortal. He discovered that the Compass Immortal was also looking at him. From his gaze, Chu Feng realized that the Compass Immortal had also noticed it.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Longjian, may I ask who it is that is tempering their body deep within the cave? Did you bring us here to bring us before that person?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Did you manage to deduce this merely by the smell of the medicinal herbs?&#x201D; Nangong Longjian revealed an expression of admiration. If the Compass Immortal had determined this, he would not be surprised. However, Chu Feng, with his young age, was actually able to deduce this. This made him have no choice but to feel admiration for Chu Feng.</p><p>This meant that not only was Chu Feng a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist in name, he also possessed the ability of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>&#x201C;It is no wonder that Suyan and Ruochen were recommending you to me even though you were only a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist back then.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Looking at it now, they have not recommended the wrong person,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian added.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be Ruochen?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, it&#x2019;s precisely my daughter, Bai Ruochen,&#x201D; Nangong Longjian nodded. Then, he said, &#x201C;Go on in. Ruochen will tell you all about it after you see her.&#x201D;</p><p>Then, Nangong Longjian said to the Compass Immortal, &#x201C;Compass Immortal, as for you&#x2026; it&#x2019;s better that I tell you about it personally.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; The Compass Immortal smiled and nodded.</p><p>Chu Feng directly entered the cave. After he reached the deepest region of the cave, he passed through a world spirit wall. Then, what appeared before him was a spirit formation and two beautiful women.</p><p>One was an alluring and sexy married woman. The other was an exceptional beauty akin to a snow lotus blooming in a land of ice.</p><p>The two of them were Bai Ruochen and her mother, Bai Suyan.</p><p>It appeared that the two of them already knew that Chu Feng was coming. Thus, Bai Ruochen had not entered the formation to temper her body. Instead, she was standing there fully clothed.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that Bai Ruochen&#x2019;s cultivation had increased extremely quickly. She was already a rank three Half Martial Emperor now.</p><p>As for Bai Suyan, this woman who was previously so powerful that Chu Feng could not determine her cultivation, Chu Feng was now able to tell what her current cultivation was with a single glance.</p><p>Bai Suyan was a rank eight Half Martial Emperor. However, her cultivation of rank eight Half Martial Emperor was her current level of cultivation. Likely, when she was at the Cyanwood Mountain, she should have been a rank seven Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>That said, things were extremely different now. Not only had Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation surpassed Bai Suyan&#x2019;s, his true battle power was something that she could not possibly compare with.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>Bai Ruochen was overjoyed to see Chu Feng. Her body leapt forward and arrived before Chu Feng. A sweet smile blossomed on her little ice-cold face. Bai Ruochen rarely ever smiled. However, when she did, it was extremely beautiful.</p><p>&#x201C;Ruochen, senior Bai,&#x201D; Chu Feng was also extremely happy. After all, he was meeting his old friend again. As such, how could he not be in joy?</p><p>&#x201C;Back when we hurriedly separated from one another at the Alliance Domain, you were only a disciple chased out by the Cyanwood Mountain. Yet now, you have become a very influential person in the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Tell me honestly. Were you really the one who released that frightening Asura Evil Spirit at the Nangong Imperial Clan?&#x201D; Bai Suyan asked with a serious expression. Bai Ruochen was also looking to Chu Feng with a curious expression on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh you. You&#x2019;ve truly surpassed my imagination,&#x201D; Bai Suyan began to inevitably recall the scene of Nangong Longjian fighting against that Asura Evil Spirit back then. Even though Nangong Longjian had managed to drive the Asura Evil Spirit away, he had been injured in the process.</p><p>&#x201C;I, Bai Suyan, have not held many people in admiration throughout my lifetime. However, boy, you have truly won me over and made me admire you wholeheartedly,&#x201D; Bai Suyan exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Bai, it seems that there are some hidden implications behind your words. By admiration, did you mean that positively or negatively?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a chuckle.</p><p>&#x201C;You brat, of course it&#x2019;s positive. Why would I belittle you?&#x201D; Bai Suyan ruthlessly smacked her palm on Chu Feng&#x2019;s head. However, Chu Feng continued to laugh foolishly.</p><p>While Bai Suyan&#x2019;s palm strike might seem to be extremely powerful, it didn&#x2019;t hurt Chu Feng in the slightest. This was not because Chu Feng possessed exceptional strength. Rather, it was because Bai Suyan was merely putting up an act, and did not put any strength into her strike at all.</p><p>&#x201C;I was merely joking. I naturally know that senior Bai thinks only good of me. Else, how could senior Longjian go and save me?&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;He went to save you with his own objectives in mind,&#x201D; Bai Suyan said.</p><p>&#x201C;Objectives? What objectives?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked. Actually, Chu Feng had already guessed it. Merely, he did not know what Nangong Longjian&#x2019;s objective was.</p><p>&#x201C;Ruochen, you go ahead and explain it to him,&#x201D; Bai Suyan smiled slightly. Then, she began to walk toward the exit. However, at the moment when she was about to pass through the spirit formation, she suddenly turned around and said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t rush, the two of you can take your time to chat with one another. Having not seen one another for so long, there must be a lot of things you wish to tell one another.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. Chu Feng, while chatting is one thing, you must not start pawing around. While I, the mother, might not mind, you should be careful, or the father will beat you up.&#x201D; After saying those words, the smile on Bai Suyan&#x2019;s face grew even more enchanting. She truly looked fascinating and charming.</p><p>As her intoxicating laughter echoed in the cave, Bai Suyan left. At that moment, only Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen remained.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng had an extremely serious expression on his face. He said to Bai Ruochen in a deadly earnest manner, &#x201C;Ruochen, rest assured, I am not as your mother describes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Pfff~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing Chu Feng say those words in such a manner, Bai Ruochen was unable to contain herself, and actually burst into laughter. Her two beautiful eyes narrowed into two crescent moons. With her melodious laughter, she was truly charming. After laughing for a long while, Bai Ruochen cast a glance at Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re still the same as before, not serious at all.&#x201D;</p><p>Then, Bai Ruochen began to describe the whole situation to Chu Feng.</p><p>It turned out that Nangong Longjian was also a world spiritist. Merely, he was wholly focused on martial cultivation. Thus, although his world spirit techniques weren&#x2019;t weak, they were greatly inferior to his martial cultivation. He was merely a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>Furthermore, although Nangong Longjian possessed outstanding talent, he suffered from an incurable disease. According to Bai Ruochen, Nangong Longjian would not be able to live for more than three more years.</p><p>However, Nangong Longjian did not wish to waste his cultivation. Thus, during this period of time, he had been trying to use taboo techniques to pass his cultivation to Bai Ruochen.</p><p>Back then, Bai Ruochen and her mother had left this place in accordance to Nangong Longjian&#x2019;s instructions. They had gone to search for the materials needed for Nangong Longjian to pass his cultivation to Bai Ruochen.</p><p>Furthermore, before Bai Ruochen and her mother left, Nangong Longjian explicitly told them that, regardless of what sort of methods they used, they must obtain the item which he wanted them to find.</p><p>Afterward, Bai Suyan discovered that item in the Ascension Sect. However, as Nangong Longjian was in closed-door training, and she was suspicious of other people, she had pretended to marry the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s Sect Master and searched for an opportunity to take that item away. And in the end&#x2026; she had indeed been able to take that item away.</p><p>However, even though they had gathered all of the necessary items, with the strength of Nangong Longjian himself, it was impossible for him to pass his power on to Bai Ruochen. He needed the help of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p><p>However, that Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist had to be someone that he could trust. That was why he was seeking the help of Chu Feng and the Compass Immortal.</p><p>Of course, the main purpose that Nangong Longjian had when he went to the Ximen Imperial Clan this time around was to save Chu Feng. As for the reason why Nangong Longjian had gone to save Chu Feng, it was because Bai Ruochen and her mother Bai Suyan had requested that he do so.</p><p>That said, no one had ever anticipated that Chu Feng would be a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist when he appeared in the Ximen Imperial Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve really became a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D; After hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s story, Bai Ruochen revealed an expression of disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;When have I ever deceived you?&#x201D; Chu Feng opened his palm. Then, a strand of Dragon Mark spirit power began to float out from his palm.</p><p>&#x201C;This is truly great,&#x201D; At that moment, Bai Ruochen was overjoyed. However, immediately after that, her expression changed. She grabbed onto chu Feng&#x2019;s hand and, with glistening tears in her eyes, said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Chu Feng, I beg of you, you must help me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Something like passing on one&#x2019;s power is truly not that simple. However, I will definitely give my all to help you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;No, that&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m talking about,&#x201D; Bai Ruochen shook her head repeatedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Then what is it?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I do not wish to obtain my father&#x2019;s cultivation. I want him to always be by my side. Chu Feng, I beg of you, please cure my father&#x2019;s illness,&#x201D; Bai Ruochen begged.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
