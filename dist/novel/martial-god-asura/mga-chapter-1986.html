<p><strong> Chapter 1986 - Dying Together</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Senior, Luan Jie has most likely gone to find the Moon Demon,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Find the Moon Demon? Could it be that they really have a way to control the Moon Demon and make the Moon Demon be of use to them?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal revealed an expression of disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;Even though it is very unbelievable, I&#x2019;m afraid that would most likely be the case. I am able to faintly sense the direction of the Moon Demon. Earlier, I noticed that the direction in which Luan Jie&#x2019;s aura disappeared is also the same direction in which the Moon Demon is at.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He has most definitely gone to find the Moon Demon. Furthermore, don&#x2019;t forget, they have managed to even control the Ancient Era&#x2019;s ferocious beasts that do not possess any intelligence,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. The Dark Hall knows a lot of the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s secrets. Their knowledge is even greater than the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, Luan Jie is a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist like his father. He is also one of the most exceptional geniuses in the Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It was only because his father ended up hiding him away that no one knows exactly how powerful he has become now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, he reappeared again, and his cultivation is already capable of contending against the two of us. I&#x2019;m afraid that his world spirit techniques will have already surpassed my own,&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I&#x2019;m afraid that we&#x2019;ll have to trouble you with leading us there. We absolutely cannot allow that Luan Jie to have his way,&#x201D; The Elf Protector said.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he swept his gaze over the current situation of the battlefield. After discovering that although the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves had not obtained an absolute superiority, they were no longer in a disadvantageous state against the Dark Hall, and were even holding a certain superiority over them. Chu Feng felt relieved.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body shifted, and he began to fly towards the direction that Luan Jie had headed to.</p><p>In response, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector also followed closely after Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the Moon Demon&#x2019;s savage, malicious-spirit-like roars were continuously resonating from all around. It was as if the Moon Demon was present all over the Moonlight Maze. However, Chu Feng was able to accurately determine the location of the Moon Demon.</p><p>Although there appeared to be three people chasing after Luan Jie, it was actually five people. The reason for that was because Su Rou and Su Mei had been behind the Weaponry Refinement Immortal the entire time. They were protected by a defensive barrier created with many treasures.</p><p>That defensive formation barrier was very powerful. Even if the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was injured, that defensive barrier would still remain undamaged. From that, it could be seen how concerned for Su Rou and Su Mei the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Su Rou and Su Mei&#x2019;s expressions turned ugly, and they revealed painful expressions.</p><p>&#x201C;Lil Rou, Lil Mei, what happened?&#x201D;</p><p>Even though Chu Feng was leading the group, after he heard Su Rou and Su Mei&#x2019;s pained voices, he immediately turned around and arrived behind the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to Su Rou and Su Mei&#x2019;s side.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, we, we are fine,&#x201D; Su Rou said as she resisted the pain. However, she was clearly drenched in cold sweat from the pain, and her complexion had also turned pale.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng discovered that a blue light and a red light were shining from Su Rou and Su Mei&#x2019;s bodies respectively. It was the Fire and Ice Pearls that were causing their grievance.</p><p>&#x201C;With how you are now, how could you two be fine?&#x201D; Chu Feng realized that it was the Fire and Ice Pearls that were tormenting Su Rou and Su Mei. They were starting to lose control over the Fire and Ice Pearls.</p><p>&#x201C;Crap! The Fire and Ice Pearls are the possessions of the Moon Demon. It is most definitely the appearance of the Moon Demon that has caused the Fire and Ice Pearls to become unstable. Little friend Chu Feng, we must extract the Fire and Ice Pearls immediately. Otherwise, I fear that Su Rou and Su Mei might be met with fatal danger,&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said in a very worried manner.</p><p>As he spoke, he released his defensive barrier around Su Rou and Su Mei and released them.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, the location of the Moon Demon is still the same. If you continue straight in this direction, you should be able to find the Moon Demon,&#x201D; Chu Feng pointed ahead.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you&#x2019;re planning to stay behind by yourself?&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal asked in surprise.</p><p>&#x201C;This matter is extremely urgent. We cannot disregard Luan Jie. Even though we do not know what sort of method he might have, he most definitely came prepared.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s ferocious beasts have been controlled by them. If even the Moon Demon is controlled by them, even the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves would not be a match for the Dark Hall. Thus, we absolutely cannot allow them to have their way,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. Little friend Chu Feng, in that case, we&#x2019;ll hand this place to you,&#x201D; The Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; Protector knew how serious the situation was. Thus, he did not hesitate and immediately chased after Luan Jie.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, these items will be able to help you,&#x201D; As for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, he handed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng. Contained within that Cosmos Sack were all sorts of precious materials and treasures for world spirit techniques.</p><p>Furthermore, before the Weaponry Refinement Immortal left, he sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, the strength of the Fire and Ice Pearls is boundless. Su Rou and Su Mei have been unable to unleash the true strength of the two pearls this entire time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;From the influence of the Moon Demon, they have already lost control of the Fire and Ice Pearls. As such, extracting them will not be that easy, and might even implicate you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although there are some words that this old man should not say, when considering the general situation, I hope that you can save yourself during a critical moment.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The reason for that is because the Holy Land of Martialism needs you right now,&#x201D; When those words entered Chu Feng&#x2019;s ears, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had already disappeared.</p><p>His intention was very clear. The Fire and Ice Pearls could go out of control at any moment. Should they really go out of control, they would unleash their true power, a power capable of bringing about destruction to the world. Not to mention Su Rou and Su Mei, even Chu Feng would be killed by their powers.</p><p>However, as Chu Feng was an outstanding Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, he would be able to detect the moment before the Fire and Ice Pearls went out of control. Thus, what the Weaponry Refinement Immortal wanted to tell Chu Feng was to give up on Su Rou and Su Mei and escape by himself should he discover that the Fire and Ice Pearls were about to go out of control.</p><p>However, how could Chu Feng possibly give up on his lovers? Even though he knew that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had told him those words with good intentions, he decided to completely ignore those words.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I am able to sense that the pearl in me is extremely unstable. An uncontrollable power is bubbling out. We will not be able to contain the pearls anymore. Quickly, leave us. Do not worry about us,&#x201D; Su Rou grabbed Chu Feng&#x2019;s hand and said in a very reluctant manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, listen to big sister. Quickly, leave us,&#x201D; Su Mei also urged Chu Feng to leave. When she said those words, she was unable to control herself as tears began to form in her eyes.</p><p>Evidently, these two girls were both able to tell that the Fire and Ice Pearls were about to go out of control. Thus, they wanted Chu Feng to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t say nonsense like that. When the Fire and Ice Pearls appeared, I was unable to protect you two. I hope that I will be able to do so this time around,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he disregarded everything that Su Rou and Su Mei tried to tell him.</p><p>Right now, Chu Feng only wanted to accomplish one thing. That was to wholeheartedly devote himself to setting up his spirit formation so that he could extract the Fire and Ice Pearls from Su Rou and Su Mei safely.</p><p>With Chu Feng&#x2019;s current world spirit techniques, it was actually a very simple task for him to remove the Fire and Ice Pearls from Su Rou and Su Mei&#x2019;s bodies.</p><p>Merely, due to the fact that the Fire and Ice Pearls were on the verge of going berserk, Chu Feng did not dare to be careless in the slightest. He had to proceed with extreme caution.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, even with that being the case, the Fire and Ice Pearls suddenly emitted dazzling fiery and icy radiances. Following that, they began to emit a fatal aura.</p><p>Chu Feng had already managed to detect that the Fire and Ice Pearls were on the verge of going out of control and their powers were about to explode. Once that happened, everyone within a perimeter of a thousand miles, including even Martial Emperor-level experts, would likely be killed. Those within ten thousand miles would definitely suffer injuries.</p><p>With Chu Feng&#x2019;s current speed, he was able to escape from the perimeter of the Fire and Ice Pearl&#x2019;s eruption. However, how could he possibly escape? How could he possibly disregard his lovers?</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
