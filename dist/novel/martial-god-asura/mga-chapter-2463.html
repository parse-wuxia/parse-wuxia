<p><strong> Chapter 2463 - Rank Seven Martial Ancestor</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Is this all the ability you possess? Turns out the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan is only this powerful.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give you another chance. This is the final chance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll stand here without moving. I will allow you to attack me as you wish.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if you are still unable to kill me this time around, I&#x2019;m sorry, but I will have to attack you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Ssss~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, many of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan&apos;s men were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p><p>Arrogance. Oh how arrogant this was. Yet, Chu Feng&#x2019;s arrogance caused their blood to race. They began to feel admiration for Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts.</p><p>As for Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling, they were so excited that their hearts were about to jump out of their chests. They thought that Chu Feng would have become powerful, but they had never imagined that Chu Feng would become so unimaginably powerful.</p><p>He had actually reached a level where he was able to completely disregard the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>Most importantly, the current Chu Feng had already managed to completely suppress the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief in terms of his manner of bearing.</p><p>At that moment, the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was no longer calm and collected. His brows were tightly narrowed, and he was dripping with sweat. This was the first time that anyone had seen the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief react in such a manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you certain that you will not fight back?&#x201D; The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked sternly.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng chuckled. Then, he said, &#x201C;A rank five Martial Ancestor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. You&#x2019;re very strong.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, with merely that, you are still not qualified to have me fight back. Go ahead and attack me. As long as you have the ability, my life will be yours to take.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng placed his hands behind his back. He was indicating to the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief that he would neither hit back nor dodge his attacks.</p><p>Most importantly, he really did not place the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief in his eyes at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Ignorant person of the younger generation. SInce you are this arrogant, I will have you die here!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing Chu Feng like that, ruthlessness flashed through the eyes of the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>Suddenly, the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief flipped his palm. Then, three red medicinal pellets appeared in his hand.</p><p>The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief swallowed the medicinal pellets with a single gulp. The next moment, crimson gaseous flames began to flare up from his body.</p><p>At that moment, the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s aura also became exceptionally fierce.</p><p>Furthermore, his aura was still increasing unceasingly. His eyes turned crimson, and even his skin turned crimson. A red vortex emerged on his forehead.</p><p>The current him simply did not resemble a person at all, nor did he resemble a monstrous beast. Rather, he was simply a demon.</p><p>&#x201C;Forbidden Medicine: Red Demon Pellet. He actually took three of them? He is planning to gamble with his life here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Young Hero Chu Feng, be careful. That Forbidden Medicine: Red Demon Pellet is the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s secret treasure. You absolutely must not be careless.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that the situation had turned bad, Zhan Yuanmo spoke to warn Chu Feng. As someone who had fought against the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan for a long time, he knew very well how powerful the Forbidden Medicine: Red Demon Pellet was.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, thank you for your warning. I know what to do,&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly smiled at Zhan Yuanmo.</p><p>That said, even though Chu Feng said those words, his expression remained unchanged. He continued to have the same confident smile on his face the entire time.</p><p>&#x201C;Watch my attack!&#x201D;</p><p>Abruptly, the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief started to attack. He tightly gripped the enormous black axe he held in his hand and, with an aura infinitely close to that of a rank six Martial Ancestor, slashed down at Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Snap~~~&#x201D;</p><p>As the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief hacked down with his axe, an enormously large axe appeared out of thin air.</p><p>That axe was not an Ancestral Armament. Rather, it was formed with martial power. The moment it appeared, heaven and earth immediately went dark. Even space itself was hacked in two.</p><p>A black and crimson slash ran through heaven and earth as it came slicing down at Chu Feng.</p><p>At that moment, all of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clans men began to sweat cold bullets for Chu Feng.</p><p>As matters stood, they had to admit that Chu Feng was their savior.</p><p>Yet, the slash unleashed by the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was truly not a small matter. They were afraid that Chu Feng would not be able to withstand that slash.</p><p>The reason for that was because what the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had unleashed was an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was the strongest Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill of their Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan, the Ancestral Taboo: Heaven-slicing Axe.</p><p>The might of this Ancestral Taboo: Heaven-slicing Axe was over several hundred times more powerful than the casual slash that the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had unleashed earlier.</p><p>The Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clansmen were afraid that Chu Feng would not be able to withstand the attack if he did not block or dodge.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, even though it was precisely such a ferocious attack, it still had the same result as the casual slash before it, and sunk into the distorted space before Chu Feng the moment it arrived before him.</p><p>The trembling sky, the crumbling space and the doomsday-like sights all returned to normal at that point.</p><p>&#x201C;How can this be?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Everyone from the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Monstrous Clan were stunned. Many among them even started to shiver with ashen faces.</p><p>Even the people of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s War Clan all had their mouths wide open in shock. Amazement filled their eyes.</p><p>As for the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, he was nearly driven mad. He began to shout hysterically, &#x201C;You&#x2026; exactly who are you? Exactly what is your origin?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I gave you a chance. Yet, you did not seize it properly. As such, it is my turn to attack now.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng smiled. Then, lightning flashed in his eyes. The next moment, a boundless oppressive might pulsed from his body, enveloping the entire region.</p><p>At that moment, everyone&#x2019;s expressions changed enormously. The reason for that was because they finally managed to sense Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation.</p><p>Rank seven Martial Ancestor, with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. That was Chu Feng&#x2019;s current cultivation.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With how young you are, how could you&#x2026; how could you be so powerful?!&#x201D;</p><p>The hysterical expression was no longer present on the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s face. Instead, endless fear and shock filled his face.</p><p>He finally realized why he was unable to cause Chu Feng any harm. Although they possessed the same sort of heaven-defying battle power, Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation was two entire levels above his own. With such a disparity, it would instead be strange if he could defeat Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you prepared to die now?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked indifferently.</p><p>&#x201C;Putt~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right after Chu Feng asked that question, the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief immediately kneeled on the ground and began to kowtow to Chu Feng while begging for forgiveness.</p><p>&#x201C;Milord, I was wrong. I have eyes, but failed to recognize Mount Tai. I was wrong to behave like a snob.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Please, please give me a chance. Please spare me. I beg of you, please spare my life,&#x201D; The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief began to beg in a lowly manner.</p><p>At that moment, not to mention the War Clan&apos;s men, even the Monstrous Clan&apos;s men were stunned by it.</p><p>Their Lord Clan Chief had always been an aloof and proud individual who did not fear death. This was the first time that they had ever seen their Lord Clan Chief acting in such a manner.</p><p>This petty and low, this craven and cowardly.</p><p>&#x201C;If I had not appeared in time, would you have spared the War Clan today?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Milord, please spare me, please spare me. I was wrong. I truly know my wrongs now.&#x201D;</p><p>The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief did not answer Chu Feng&#x2019;s question. He knew that it would be useless for him to try to explain himself at that moment. The only way for him to survive would be to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness.</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, I will not exterminate your Monstrous Clan after your death. Instead, I will spare them so that they can continue existing,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; The Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief slowly raised his head and asked in a serious manner. At that moment, he reacted as if he had prepared to accept death.</p><p>&#x201C;Really,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had a rapid change in expression. He suddenly turned around and began to rush into the distance with rapid speed. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared.</p><p>The grand Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had actually escaped.</p><p>At that moment, everyone was stunned. They had no words to describe what had just happened, no words to describe this dramatic change.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he chuckled and shook his head helplessly.</p><p>He did not give chase. Instead, he slowly raised his arm and faced it in the direction where the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had escaped.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In the instant that Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm was opened, a strong wind immediately swept forth. Not only were the trees uprooted from the ground, but even the clouds were sucked into Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm.</p><p>An enormous attractive force was being emitted by Chu Feng&#x2019;s palm. It was planning to devour everything in its path.</p><p>&#x201C;Noo!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Following a scream, a figure that was frantically trying to escape was sucked toward Chu Feng from afar. It was none other than the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>That Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, the person proclaimed to be the strongest existence in the War Clan&#x2019;s Ancient Domain. was actually unable to resist Chu Feng in the slightest.</p><p>&#x201C;I want you dead, so you cannot live,&#x201D; Chu Feng spoke in a dull manner. The same moment he spoke those words, sharp killing intent emerged in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>The next moment, a muffled explosion was heard. Before everyone, the Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief exploded and died. He was killed by Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
