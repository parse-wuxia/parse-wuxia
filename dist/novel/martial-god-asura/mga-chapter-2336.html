<p><strong> Chapter 2336 - It&#x2019;s You?</strong></p><p>&#x201C;In that case, it would mean that another rank two True Immortal has appeared in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&#x201D; Old Demon Rakshasa said with a face filled with astonishment. The reason for that was because this was truly no small matter.</p><p>&#x201C;Rank two True Immortal? It is still impossible to determine the cultivation yet. However, that individual would be at least a rank two True Immortal,&#x201D; The Lord Protector said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Protector, doesn&#x2019;t this mean that our Infant Soul Sect has gotten another powerful enemy?&#x201D; Hun Lian started to panic.</p><p>&#x201C;It is still difficult to determine whether or not that individual is friend or a foe. The reason for that is because that person should&#x2019;ve directly killed us and not allowed us to escape if he was a foe.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if that person is a friend, he would not have helped Chu Feng,&#x201D; The Lord Protector said.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that that individual is neutral?&#x201D; Old Demon Rakshasa asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Most likely, that person is someone with some sort of relationship with Chu Feng. However, with that person there, we cannot rashly do anything to Chu Feng. We must first seek Consultation on this matter with Lord Sect Master,&#x201D; That Lord Protector said.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Protector, in that case, what should we do regarding the things here?&#x201D; Old Demon Rakshasa asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that individual is keeping a neutral standing, he most likely won&#x2019;t meddle in this. We will continue according to plan,&#x201D; The Lord Protector said.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Milord,&#x201D; Old Demon Rakshasa said.</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>Meanwhile. At the grand slaughtering formation. Chu Feng was currently surrounded by everyone. The crowd were still immersed in being overjoyed from Chu Feng scaring away that Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s True Immortal.</p><p>After all, this was truly an earth-shaking battle. The crowd all felt that they had entered and exited the gates to death many times. They felt that it was all thanks to Chu Feng that they were able to survive.</p><p>Thus, those people that had not kneeled earlier, regardless of whether they were people from the younger generation or people from the older generation, regardless of which sect or school they might be from, were all expressing their thanks to Chu Feng right now.</p><p>As for those people that had knelt earlier, they did not dare to utter a word, and were filled with remorse.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, brother Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I was wrong, I was wrong. Please give me a chance, please help plead to my master for leniency for me .&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I did not really want to join the Infant Soul Sect. I merely wanted to continue living. Furthermore, I still have a family. I am the hope of my family.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, a figure rushed over, kneeled before Chu Feng and grabbed the corner of Chu Feng&#x2019;s sleeve.</p><p>Turning toward that figure, it was actually Kou Kang.</p><p>At that moment, Kou Kang no longer held the overwhelming attitude he had held before. He was kneeling before Chu Feng and weeping bitter tears. His appearance was truly petty and low.</p><p>&#x201C;You want me to plead on your behalf? You have truly searched for the wrong person,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled coldly. There was not the slightest trace of sympathy in his eyes. With a wave of his sleeve, he flung Kou Kang away.</p><p>&#x201C;Kou Kang, you absolute disgrace! Earlier, you slandered little friend Chu Feng. Yet now, you want little friend Chu Feng to plead for you? You have truly disgraced our Three Stars Hall!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No, you are no longer a part of our Three Stars Hall! You damned traitor! Our Lord Headmaster has trained you this many years in vain! You simply possess the heart of a wolf and the lungs of a dog! You are inferior to even dogs and pigs!&#x201D;</p><p>A group of elders from the Three Stars Hall rushed over. Using special treasures, they trapped Kou Kang completely.</p><p>Perhaps it might be because they felt resentment in their hearts, but these elders were very ruthless. Not only did they cause enormous pain to Kou Kang, they also completely battered him.</p><p>At that moment, Kou Kang began to plead for leniency toward Song Biyu and his other junior brothers and sisters. However, Song Biyu and the others not only did not help him, they instead began to lash out against him in contempt.</p><p>it was then, that Kou Kang found himself completely isolated. His situation was truly miserable.</p><p>That being said, scenes like the one that was happening to Kou Kang were happening all over the place.</p><p>While those that had just kneeled to Old Demon Rakshasa were still relatively okay, those that had kneeled to Old Demon Rakshasa, insulted Chu Feng, spoke on behalf of the Infant Soul Sect, and declared that newborn infants deserved their deaths were all facing a disastrous situation.</p><p>However, practically no one sympathized with those people that were being punished. After all, they were reaping what they had sown.</p><p>That being said, one thing was without a doubt. That was, after today, Chu Feng would become much more renowned. After all, the people present here were from all over the world, and belonged to all kinds of different powers.</p><p>Not only had these people experienced Chu Feng&#x2019;s heaven-defying talent, they had also experienced Chu Feng&#x2019;s character.</p><p>Not only were these people going to punish people like Kou Kang that lowered their heads to the Infant Soul Sect, they were also going to help Chu Feng spread word of what happened here today to the rest of the world.</p><p>However, at that moment, whilst everyone was praising Chu Feng nonstop for his conduct and deeds, Chu Feng had already left.</p><p>It was not that Chu Feng was in a rush to enter Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remnants. Rather, after seeing how the Ying Heavenly Clan attacked people from the Three Stars Hall and the Sunset Cloud Valley earlier, Chu Feng was worried about leaving Xu Yiyi, Song Biyu and the others here.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng wanted to bring Xu Yiyi, Song Biyu and the others to locations with experts from the Three Stars Hall or the Sunset Cloud Valley so that it would be safer for them.</p><p>It just so happened that Xu Yiyi and the others knew of a location where the experts from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall were gathered at. Reportedly, Elder Ning Shuang was also there.</p><p>While Elder Ning Shaung&#x2019;s cultivation might not be considered extremely powerful, he was still a rank five Martial Ancestor. With a cultivation of rank five Martial Ancestor, he would be able to protect Xu Yiyi and the others.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng planned to bring Xu Yiyi and the others to Elder Ning Shuang&#x2019;s location.</p><p>However, no one would&#x2019;ve expected that the place where the experts from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall were gathered at, the place where Xu Yiyi, Song Biyu and the others felt to be absolutely safe, had fallen into enemy hands.</p><p>It was the Ying Heavenly Clan...</p><p>The people from the Ying Heavenly Clan had trapped Elder Ning Shuang and the others. However, the strongest person among the group of people from the Ying Heavenly Clan was not a member of the Ying Heavenly Clan. Instead, it was a familiar individual.</p><p>This person not only possessed golden hair and a golden beard, he was also wearing a golden hairpiece. With his rank six Martial Ancestor-level strength, he had completely sealed off all escape for the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s and Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s experts present.</p><p>This person was none other than Daoist Gold Star.</p><p>&#x201C;Daoist Gold Star, are you really going to assist the Ying Heavenly Clan against our Sunset Cloud Valley?&#x201D; Blood was present on the corners of Elder Ning Shuang&#x2019;s mouth. He was already injured. However, sharpness remained in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Gold Star, you were originally our Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s ally. How could you instead work for our Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s opponent? Do you not fear retribution, do you not fear the ridicule of others for betraying us?&#x201D; An elder from the Three Stars Hall said angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Betraying you? Hahahaha&#x2026; Ridiculous, truly ridiculous!!!&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star burst into loud laughter. Then, he said, &#x201C;Back at the Sunset Cloud Valley, wasn&#x2019;t it your Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s headmaster who joined hands with the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master to beat down on me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Now you all remember that you were my allies once? I&#x2019;m sorry to tell you this, but our alliance has long since been broken! As for the one who broke this alliance, it was none other than you all!&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star spoke in a very furious manner.</p><p>After he finished saying those words, he raised his hand. &#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang and that elder from the Three Stars Hall were knocked several meters away.</p><p>When the two of them landed on the ground, they were covered in blood and seriously injured. They had lost the ability to continue fighting.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elders!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall&#x2019;s disciples started to panic. They wanted to rush to support Elder Ning Shuang and that other elder.</p><p>However, right after they took a couple steps forward, a burst of oppressive might descended from the sky and forced them onto their stomachs, making them unable to move in the slightest.</p><p>Naturally, that oppressive might was sent forth by Daoist Gold Star.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. Today, you all will die. None of you will be able to live,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star sneered.</p><p>&#x201C;Gold Star, if you feel resentment toward our Sunset Cloud Valley and Three Stars Hall, you can go right ahead and kill me. However, do not harm those children. They have nothing to do with this,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang spoke in an extremely weak voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Nothing to do with this?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The fact that they are people from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall means that this matter concerns them,&#x201D; Daoist Gold Star smiled coldly.</p><p>Then, he looked to the disciples from the Three Stars Hall and the Sunset Cloud Valley, &#x201C;Remember this. It is because of Chu Feng that you all will die today. If it wasn&#x2019;t for your headmaster and Valley Master breaking off their relationship with me for the sake of that Chu Feng, you all would not have had to die today.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, even if I am to kill you all, you all must not feel hatred toward me. Instead, you should be hating that Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is due to that Chu Feng that you all are going to die here!!!&#x201D;</p><p>After Daoist Gold Star finished saying those words, he raised his hand and unleashed surging killing intent.</p><p>At that moment, the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley and Three Stars Hall all closed their eyes. Sensing the killing intent emitted by Daoist Gold Star, they knew that they would not be able to survive today.</p><p>&#x201C;Daoist Gold Star, I&#x2019;m afraid that I&#x2019;ll have to disappoint you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Today, you will not be able to kill a single person from the Three Stars Hall or the Sunset Cloud Valley.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>Following that, a gentle power emerged from the sky. It cut through Daoist Gold Star&#x2019;s oppressive might and set the people from the Three Stars Hall and Sunset Cloud Valley free.</p><p>This sudden scene greatly astonished Daoist Gold Star causing him to immediately look toward the direction from where the voice came from.</p><p>Upon looking, his expression changed enormously. In alarm, he cried out, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s you?&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
