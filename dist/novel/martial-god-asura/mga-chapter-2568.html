<p><strong>Chapter 2568 - Eruption Of Rage</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Humph, overestimating one&#x2019;s capabilities.&#x201D;</p><p>Faced with Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s even more powerful attack, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief merely snorted coldly.</p><p>Then, he waved his sleeve and &#x201C;clank, clank,&#x201D; Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s two Ancestral Armament daggers were knocked flying.</p><p>Just like this, he effortlessly defeated Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s strongest attack.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuahh.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at this moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief extended his palm and made a grabbing motion. Immediately, Zi Xunyi let out a scream.</p><p>The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had actually managed to grab Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s neck from afar. Furthermore, he directly moved her toward him.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Ying Mingchao shouted, &#x201C;Stop!&#x201D;</p><p>However, the more he panicked, the more complacent the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief became.</p><p>He looked to Ying Mingchao and said, &#x201C;I nearly forgot to tell you this: not only am I able to kill you, but I&#x2019;m also able to kill Chu Feng and this woman.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, now that I take a closer look, this girl is quite attractive.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No wonder you and that fellow from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan cared so much for her.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief cast her gaze toward Zi Xunyi. Furthermore, it was unknown whether or not he was doing it deliberately, or he was feeling that from the bottom of his heart, but a perverted expression actually emerged in his eyes.</p><p>Then, he turned back around toward Ying Mingchao and said, &#x201C;Ying Mingchao, I wonder, have you slept with this beauty yet?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That said, it&#x2019;s alright. Although I am undoubtedly going to die, I still have some time. I&#x2019;m going to let you enjoy a show during this period of time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What are you planning to do?!&#x201D; Ying Mingchao shouted furiously. Panic emerged in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;What I plan to do? I&#x2019;m planning to toy with your woman right before you.&#x201D; As the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief spoke, he grabbed Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s left shoulder. Then, a &#x2018;rip&#x2019; was heard as a piece of Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s clothes was ripped apart.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this, extremely intense killing intent exploded in Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was completely in the grasp of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>No matter how furious he was, no matter how much he struggled, he could only remain suspended above the Ancestral Armament of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief. He was simply powerless to do anything to the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you furious? Go on, be furious. I am precisely going to sully your woman right before you.&#x201D;</p><p>After the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he extended his hand toward Zi Xunyi.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at this moment, an ear-piercing explosion suddenly sounded from the sky.</p><p>The next moment, black clouds began to surge as an extremely powerful aura started to emit from Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing the current Ying Mingchao, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was stunned.</p><p>He was surprised to discover that Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s eyes were not only emitting overwhelming killing intent, but they were also emitting a dark green light.</p><p>That light simply does not resemble that which might come from a human&#x2019;s eyes. Rather, it was like a light emitted by the eyes of ferocious beasts.</p><p>Not only that, but there was even dark green light within the surging black clouds in the sky.</p><p>&#x201C;Paaa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Ying Mingchao grabbed onto the Ancestral Armament that had pierced his body with his hands. Then, with his flesh overturned, he forcibly pulled the Ancestral Armament out from his body.</p><p>Seeing that, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief hurriedly move on to grab the Ancestral Armament. With great effort, he was trying to thrust his Ancestral Armament back into Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s body.</p><p>However, when he tried to do so, he discovered that he was actually unable to contend against Ying Mingchao. Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s current strength had completely surpassed his own.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, blood splattered everywhere. Not only had Ying Mingchao managed to pull out that Ancestral Armament, he even directly snatched that Ancestral Armament away from the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment the rumbles in the sky grew even more ear-piercing. Even the earth started to shake violently.</p><p>The dark green light in the clouds grew brighter and brighter. Vaguely, Chu Feng saw the face of a ferocious beast from the surging black clouds.</p><p>It was an enormous face. It practically covered the entire sky, covered the entire Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>It was a wolf&#x2019;s face. However, the aura that it emitted was much more powerful than that of wolves.</p><p>&#x201C;Divine Power?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze changed. Although the dark green light in the sky gave off a very cold and oppressive sensation, Chu Feng was able to tell that it was Divine Power.</p><p>However, upon reaching the True Immortal realm, both the power of Heavenly Bloodlines and Divine Powers would all be restricted.</p><p>For Ying Mingchao to be able to utilize the power of his Divine Power meant that he had completely undone the restriction the True Immortal realm had placed upon him.</p><p>&#x201C;No, impossible! How can you use your Divine Power?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief started to panic. His complexion turned pale, and his body started shivering. He was moving backwards repeatedly.</p><p>He was able to sense that Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s current aura had completely surpassed his own.</p><p>That aura was simply too powerful. It was at the peak of a rank two True Immortal. Likely, apart from rank three True Immortals, no one would be able to contend against the current Ying Mingchao.</p><p>&#x201C;I will make you pay!&#x201D; Ying Mingchao said as he gnashed his teeth.</p><p>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief grew completely panicked.</p><p>He was surprised to discover that not only had Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s eyes turned dark green like those of ferocious beasts, even his teeth were emitting a dark green radiance. Furthermore, his teeth were as sharp, as those of ferocious beasts.</p><p>However, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief remembered very well that Ying Mingchao was a human, and not a ferocious beast or a monstrous beast.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief suddenly turned around. He was actually planning to flee.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, like a beast, Ying Mingchao leapt in midair and pounced at the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>His speed was simply too fast. In a flash, he arrived behind the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and brought him down.</p><p>The two men fell from high in the sky and crashed onto the ground.</p><p>Upon landing, Ying Mingchao immediately bit into the neck of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Ahhhh!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Right away, blood splattered all over, and the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief let out a miserable scream.</p><p>However, that was only the beginning.</p><p>One bite.</p><p>Two bites.</p><p>Three bites.</p><p>Ten bites.</p><p>A hundred bites.</p><p>&#x2026;&#x2026;</p><p>Ying Mingchao was reacting as if he was truly possessed by a ferocious beast. He was using his teeth to tear at the body of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief repeatedly.</p><p>Furthermore, it seemed like his teeth were capable of causing unbearable pain. Thus, the screams of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief soon filled the entire Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>In merely the blink of an eye, all the flesh on the body of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had been bitten off.</p><p>However, Ying Mingchao did not stop there. He began to bite the bones of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, forcibly biting them apart.</p><p>The hatred Ying Mingchao had toward the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was simply too deep. It was as if he could only alleviate his hatred by drinking the blood and eating the flesh of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Mingchao, you&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that Zi Xunyi had a very complicated gaze.</p><p>Evidently, she was moved at that moment.</p><p>After all, it was all because of her that Ying Mingchao had become like that. This indirectly revealed how important she was in Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s heart.</p><p>&#x201C;God damn it!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that the situation was bad, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief turned around and began to flee.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, that Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief is escaping,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen immediately called to Chu Feng&#x2019;s attention.</p><p>&#x201C;Let him escape,&#x201D; Chu Feng actually also noticed the escape. However, he did not bother to pay attention to it.</p><p>Firstly, Chu Feng did not have the strength to stop the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief from escaping.</p><p>Even if that Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was seriously injured, he remained a rank two True Immortal. As such, Chu Feng was still unable to defeat him.</p><p>As for Ying Mingchao, he was overwhelmed with rage. As such, there was only the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief in his eyes. He was simply unable to consider other things.</p><p>Even if Chu Feng were to bring to his attention that the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was escaping, Ying Mingchao would still not pay attention to it.</p><p>Chu Feng understood Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s current state very well. He had already gone berserk. He had become deranged.</p><p>His soul was completely occupied by his rage. He was no longer capable of reasoning. At that moment, there was only one thing in his mind. That was, he wanted to make the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief pay.</p><p>As for everything else, he simply did not care.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
