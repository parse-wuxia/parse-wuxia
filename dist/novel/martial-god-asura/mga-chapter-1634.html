<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1634 - Setting Up Spirit Formations</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian, what do you want me to do? Chu Feng would like to hear the details,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like this&#x2026;&#x201D; Aunt Lian mentioned the matter regarding them planning to teach Chu Feng and the others the secret skill. However, she deliberately told Chu Feng to try his best to hide in the corner of the crowd and to conceal his aura so that the secret skill would not choose him.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand. The secret skill will naturally choose the person with the strongest talent, the person with the best potential.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They are planning to use the secret technique to test my talent. If the secret technique doesn&#x2019;t choose me, I will be able to escape this calamity. However, if it does, I will likely be hunted down,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled. He had managed to guess what the Nangong Imperial Clan planned to do.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t think of it like that. It might not be as bad as you imagine it to be,&#x201D; Aunt Lian said.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian, you don&#x2019;t have to speak for them. If they are highly principled people, they would definitely not stop me from leaving should I want to leave today. However, not only did they stop me, they&#x2019;re also going to test me. How could you not understand what sort of people they are?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked with a smile.</p><p>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Aunt Lian grew silent. At this moment, a deep sense of guilt appeared on her face. She deeply regretted her decision to invite Chu Feng to the Nangong Imperial Clan. She felt that she was the one who had pulled Chu Feng into this pit of fire.</p><p>Chu Feng had merely reached a breakthrough in his cultivation. What wrong had he done? The person that was at fault was her. She shouldn&#x2019;t have brought Chu Feng here.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it&#x2019;s all my fault,&#x201D; Aunt Lian said with a very apologetic expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Aunt Lian, don&#x2019;t say it like that. Even though the current situation is not very hopeful, I will definitely not blame you for it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll say it like this. Even if I am to become the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s enemy in the future, you will still be my Aunt Lian. Nangong Ya, Baihe and Moli will still be my friends,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s calm appearance shocked Aunt Lian.</p><p>At this moment, Aunt Lian discovered that Chu Feng was more mature than any of the people his age that she had met. Even when facing death, he possessed no fear, and his mind was extremely clear.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, that wisdom of yours will definitely let you become a very capable person in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Also, rest assured. Since I have brought you here, I will also be able to bring you out. If they really plan to kill you, they must first step past the corpse of me, Nangong Lian.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is not that I, Nangong Lian, am arrogant. Rather, in the Nangong Imperial Clan, if there is anyone that wishes to kill me, Nangong Lian, it will also depend on whether they have the courage to do so,&#x201D; Aunt Lian said those words very loudly. Likely, she was deliberately trying to have someone hear her.</p><p>After she finished saying that, Aunt Lian walked out of Chu Feng&#x2019;s room. However, she did not really leave the area. Instead, after she walked out of Chu Feng&#x2019;s residence, she waved her sleeve and set up a golden-bright and dazzling spirit formation that covered Chu Feng&#x2019;s residence. Afterward, Aunt Lian sat down cross-legged and closed her eyes.</p><p>When Chu Feng saw this scene, his heart was moved. He knew that Aunt Lian was planning to protect him, that she was planning to follow Chu Feng closely to protect him starting from today.</p><p>As someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan, the fact that Aunt Lian was willing to do all this for Chu Feng was sufficient to show him what sort of person she was. She was definitely a person who was very loyal to her friends.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, they will be using the secret skill to test your potential tomorrow. What do you plan to do? Are you really going to hide in the corner of the crowd, conceal your own potential and watch as the secret skill is obtained by another? You must know that this is a secret skill we&#x2019;re talking about here,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026; although it will be letting down Aunt Lian, I, Chu Feng, am not someone who will let the fatty meat beside my mouth slip by me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, that&#x2019;s more like it. That&#x2019;s the Chu Feng I know. It&#x2019;s merely a Nangong Imperial Clan, who do they think themselves to be?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If they wish to play, we shall play with them. With this queen and you acting together, we&#x2019;ll play them to death,&#x201D; After hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s response, Eggy was very happy. Sometimes, Her Lady Queen was like a mischievous child. She did not fear provoking others. The only thing she feared was being bored.</p><p>Chu Feng did not sleep that night. He instead used the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones to set up three spirit formations.</p><p>The first was the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation.</p><p>The second was the Evil Spirit Binding Formation.</p><p>As for the third, it was the World Spirit Energy Storing Formation.</p><p>There was no need to mention what the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation and the Evil Spirit Binding Formation were. They were critical to releasing and controlling the other Asura World Spirit in Chu Feng&#x2019;s body.</p><p>As for that World Spirit Energy Storing Formation, it was used to store Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spirit Energy. After all, when the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation and the Evil Spirit Binding Formation were activated, they would require an enormous amount of world spirit energy. Furthermore, ordinary world spirit energy would likely not do. Only Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spirit Energy would be of use.</p><p>At that time, it would be too strenuous for Chu Feng to refine the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones while activating the spirit formations.</p><p>That was the reason why Chu Feng set up the World Spirit Energy Storing Formation. Chu Feng was going to transfer all of the energy from the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones into the World Spirit Energy Storing Formation.</p><p>Then, he was going to transfer the World Spirit Energy Storing Formation into his body. With the World Spirit Energy Storing Formation as the vessel, he was going to store the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spirit Energy in his body.</p><p>When Chu Feng needed the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spirit Energy, he would be able to release the boundless Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spirit Energy from the World Spirit Energy Storing Formation with a single thought.</p><p>However, if Chu Feng were only setting up these three spirit formations, he would not have to spend an entire night doing so. After all, setting up spirit formations was a very fast thing to do.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng had spent so much time setting up these formations was because he had cautiously placed the two extremely dangerous Taboo Formation Techniques, the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation and the Evil Spirit Binding Formation, onto his left and right hands. Furthermore, Chu Feng had set up a mechanism whereby the two spirit formations would be activated simultaneously the moment he placed his hands together.</p><p>Like this, Chu Feng would be able to immediately activate the World Spirit Seal Breaking Formation and the Evil Spirit Binding Formation to release the berserk Asura World Spirit in his body at the moment of crisis.</p><p>&#x201C;If possible, I really hope that I will not have to use you two in the Nangong Imperial Clan.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng looked to his ordinary-looking hands and smiled lightly. Only he knew how dangerous his pair of ordinary-looking hands actually were.</p><p>The reason why Chu Feng had spent an entire night doing all this was because Chu Feng did not trust the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>Even though Chu Feng was not certain whether or not he&#x2019;d be able to successfully control the other Asura World Spirit with all the preparations he had made, Chu Feng was certain that he would be able to successfully release that other Asura World Spirit and turn it into an Evil Spirit the moment he clasped his hands together.</p><p>At that time, everything would be fine if Chu Feng could successfully control it. However, if he could not successfully control it, then, with its killing nature, it would definitely unleash a slaughter in the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p>At that time, whether the Nangong Imperial Clan would be able to escape this calamity would all depend on their strength, as well as their luck...</p><p>At this time, the sky had brightened. Chu Feng used his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes to look outside, and discovered that the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan had grown restless. Many people had gathered outside of his residence.</p><p>Even Nangong Baihe, Nangong Moli and Nangong Ya had come.</p><p>However, due to the fact that Aunt Lian was guarding this place, no one was able to step into Chu Feng&#x2019;s residence. All they could do was silently watch from outside.</p><p>Their gazes contained hostility, curiosity and even fear.</p><p>However, one thing was without doubt. That was, after what had happened yesterday, Chu Feng had become the focus of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
