<p><strong> Chapter 2236 - Dragon Marked Armor</strong></p><p>Being stared at by Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors felt very uncomfortable. However, he still did not believe that Chu Feng possessed any capability of teaching him a lesson.</p><p>Thus, in a disapproving manner, he said, &#x201C;Trying to scare me? Did you think I was someone that was easily scared?&#x201D;</p><p>After that, the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor&#x2019;s body shifted, and he arrived before Liu Xiaoli.</p><p>A fist flickering with golden light began to crash toward Liu Xiaoli&#x2019;s body like a torrential storm.</p><p>How could Liu Xiaoli, who wore silver armor, be able to withstand an attack from the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors? She was practically unable to dodge even a single fist. She was immediately beaten up nonstop like a sandbag.</p><p>When even Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket were unable to withstand that sort of attack, how could Liu Xiaoli possibly be able to withstand it?</p><p>Soon after, Liu Xiaoli started vomiting blood and lost consciousness. Miserable. In terms of being miserable, Liu Xiaoli was most definitely the person that had suffered the most miserably in the spirit formation.</p><p>She was the only person that was beaten unconscious.</p><p>&#x201C;She is truly unable to take a beating. I have yet to even go all-out,&#x201D; Seeing Liu Xiaoli losing consciousness, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors did not have the slightest trace of guilt. Instead, he licked his lips, as if itching to continue his beating.</p><p>In fact, if it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that the Golden Crane True Immortal had warned him to not be too excessive earlier, he would definitely not have stopped just because Liu Xiaoli fainted.</p><p>The eldest of the four World Spiritist Emperors raised his head, looked to his three brothers standing outside the spirit formation and said with a beaming smile, &#x201C;Little brothers, your big brother will come to join you all now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Mn?&#x201D; However, right after he finished saying those words, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors started to frown.</p><p>Logically, he should have already completely defeated all of the people in the spirit formation. As such, the spirit formation should have teleported him out. Yet, there was no reaction at all?</p><p>Could it be that someone had managed to slip past him?</p><p>However, he knew best how strong his attacks were. Everyone was defeated by him. Furthermore, all those defeated by him had lost their ability to continue fighting.</p><p>Only by teleporting him out would those people be able to regain their freedom and battle power. Yet, what was with this situation right now?</p><p>Even though he felt it to be extremely inconceivable, he still turned around to look. He was trying to figure out whether or not there was anyone present that he had not beaten to a state of losing their ability to fight.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D; Upon turning around, the expression of the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor immediately changed.</p><p>Sure enough, there was someone standing in the grand formation completely undamaged. As for this person, he was someone that the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; eldest never had expected.</p><p>That person was none other than Chu Feng!!!</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng?!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing the current Chu Feng, not to mention the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, practically everyone&#x2019;s expressions changed enormously.</p><p>Not only had Chu Feng entered the grand formation, there was also a world spirit armor on his body.</p><p>If it were an ordinary world spirit armor, it would not be enough to cause the crowd to become so astonished.</p><p>However, not only was Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit armor shining with golden brightness, there were also dragons galloping within it.</p><p>Mightly! Domineering! Extremely Imposing!!!</p><p>This meant that Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit armor was a level above even the golden armor that the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors wore.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? There&#x2019;re actually dragon marks galloping in Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit armor?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that it&#x2019;s not that he was unable to condense any spirit armor, but rather that the spirit armor he was condensing was so powerful that it caused him to take much longer to condense it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s how it was! It wasn&#x2019;t that Chu Feng was unable to condense any world spirit armor. Rather, it was that the armor that he was condensing surpassed all of ours!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, the crowd finally realized that they had been mistaken earlier.</p><p>How could Chu Feng be said to be unable to condense any spirit armor? He was simply condensing spirit armor that surpassed all the others&#x2019;.</p><p>Ashamed. Guilt. They were feeling ashamed and guilty for feeling disappointed with Chu Feng earlier.</p><p>However, more than that, they were feeling pleasantly surprised. Chu Feng had brought them an enormously pleasant surprise.</p><p>After feeling pleasantly surprised, the crowd all turned their gazes to the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors. They all wanted to see exactly what sort of reaction he would have at the moment</p><p>Upon seeing his expression, many people were unable to keep themselves from laughing.</p><p>The expression of the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor, who had previously acted so arrogantly and mocked Chu Feng, was simply marvelous.</p><p>His gaze was fixed as if stunned, and his complexion had turned green. In fact, his lips were even twitching.</p><p>After all, he was no fool. He was able to tell that the world spirit armor that Chu Feng had condensed was stronger than his own. Thus, naturally, the strength that Chu Feng possessed would surpass his own.</p><p>&#x201C;I said that I would make you pay,&#x201D; As Chu Feng said those words, he turned into a golden ray that flew toward the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.</p><p>&#x201C;Come! As if I&#x2019;m afraid of you?!&#x201D; With so many people watching, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors did not show weakness. Instead, he also charged toward Chu Feng.</p><p>However, everyone was able to tell that he was lacking confidence, that he was putting on a bold face to fight against Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A loud explosion was heard. The eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor was knocked flying before ruthlessly smashing into the wall of the spirit formation.</p><p>When he fell to the ground, he started to vomit blood, and was unable to move a single step.</p><p>With merely a single attack, Chu Feng had beaten him to a state of losing the ability to fight.</p><p>Such a scene shocked everyone. Even Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket revealed shocked expressions.</p><p>A single strike was all it took. The difference between their spirit power was simply too enormous.</p><p>Even though the crowd had already realized that the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors would definitely not be a match for Chu Feng, they had never expected that he would lose so miserably.</p><p>&#x201C;Bang, bang, bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a shocking scene occurred. Chu Feng did not plan to let the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor get away. He rushed toward him and began to ruthlessly kick his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you doing? Stop immediately!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Upon seeing that scene, the three brothers that stood outside the comprehensive formation started to panic. They hurriedly shouted at Chu Feng to stop.</p><p>&#x201C;What am I doing? I&#x2019;m naturally beating him up. However, you all cannot blame me for that. After all, that is the rule of this place, and I am only doing things according to the rules.&#x201D;</p><p>With a smile on his face, Chu Feng repeated what the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors had said before to his three brothers.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your nonsense! The rules of this place say it is enough as long as one has lost the ability to fight! Our big brother has already lost the ability to fight, why are you still attacking him?!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Stop immediately!!!&#x201D; The three brothers shouted.</p><p>&#x201C;Lost the ability to fight? That is not decided by you all. Instead, it is decided by me. The way I see it, he has yet to lose the ability to fight. Thus, I cannot stop yet.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, Chu Feng gathered strength into his feet and began kicking the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors more ruthlessly.</p><p>It was not only his head. His chest and his legs were also attacked by Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Stop! Stop immediately!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord True Immortal, that child has gone against your rules. I believe that he should be punished severely.&#x201D;</p><p>Feeling helpless, the three brothers actually began to request for assistance from the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p><p>However, to their disappointment, the Golden Crane True Immortal did not even bother to say a word. He had simply ignored them. It was as if he couldn&#x2019;t hear what they were saying at all.</p><p>This caused those three brothers to have very ugly expressions on their faces. The reason for that was because it would be impossible for the Golden Crane True Immortal to not hear what they were saying. It was evident that his decision to not say anything to stop Chu Feng meant that he was deliberately allowing Chu Feng to beat up their older brother.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
