<p><strong> Chapter 2257 - Revealing One&#x2019;s Ability</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley master, please calm your anger. This subordinate truly didn&#x2019;t know that this Chu Feng was actually an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master hurriedly tried to explain.</p><p>&#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t know?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley revealed a suspicious expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, this subordinate would not dare to deceive you. I truly didn&#x2019;t know,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master continued to explain.</p><p>&#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t know? Head Law Enforcement Elder, you really didn&#x2019;t know that I was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you really didn&#x2019;t know that I was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, why did you force-feed me that medicinal pellet that restricted my spirit power and my ability to speak?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that it wasn&#x2019;t because you were afraid that Lord Valley Master would find out that I&#x2019;m an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked Li Rui&#x2019;s master. His tone was very sharp, stabbing straight at the crucial things.</p><p>&#x201C;What? You actually fed him a medicinal pellet that sealed his spirit power and even his speech?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master was extremely shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, please do not listen to his nonsense. I simply did not feed him such a medicinal pellet,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master hurriedly explained.</p><p>&#x201C;You shut up first!&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master berated coldly. Li Rui&#x2019;s master no longer dared to quibble. Like that, he quietly kneeled on the ground.</p><p>In response, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master looked to Chu Feng and asked, &#x201C;You are called Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, if you have received unjust treatment, I will definitely obtain justice for you later. However, I have a presumptuous request right now,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you want me to treat your Lady Mother&#x2019;s illness?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you willing?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master, please lead the way,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. Please follow me,&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng agreed to help, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master revealed a relaxed smile.</p><p>However, before showing the way for Chu Feng, he used his sharp gaze to look at Li Rui&#x2019;s master, &#x201C;Elder Tuoba, wait here. Before I return, you are not allowed to leave.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, Milord,&#x201D; Li Rui&#x2019;s master replied respectfully.</p><p>At that moment, he no longer possessed the same sort of complacence he had earlier. Instead, nervousness and unease filled his face.</p><p>Being led by the Valley Master, Chu Feng walked deep into the Valley Master&#x2019;s residence. He then arrived at a neat and tidy bedchamber.</p><p>This bedchamber was not very large, and was decorated very simply. Although it was not majestic, it was very neat. When looking at it, one would feel very comfortable.</p><p>Right after entering the bedchamber, Chu Feng heard the painful voice of an elderly person.</p><p>It was a female. She was extremely old, so old that her body was filled with wrinkles and age spots. Even her hair was nearly all gone, as were all of her teeth.</p><p>As for this woman, she was being tormented by the pain of her illness so much so that she had lost consciousness.</p><p>Needing no introduction, Chu Feng managed to guess that this old woman must be the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master&#x2019;s mother.</p><p>Merely, to Chu Feng&#x2019;s surprise, the mother of the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master did not possess a high level of cultivation. In fact, her cultivation could be said to be very weak.</p><p>She was actually only a Martial Emperor. Furthermore, she was only a rank one Martial Emperor.</p><p>In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, that level of cultivation could be considered extremely weak.</p><p>However, that was not the important aspect that Chu Feng was focused on. His focus was fixed onto this old woman&#x2019;s illness.</p><p>Upon seeing her, without even waiting for the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master to say anything, Chu Feng walked up toward her and began to stabilize her illness.</p><p>As the saying goes, an expert&#x2019;s ability will be revealed the moment they act.</p><p>Once Chu Feng started, he immediately caused the gaze of the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master to change. All of his misgivings and hidden caution against Chu Feng were mostly dispelled at that moment.</p><p>The reason for that was because after Chu Feng started, not only did the Valley Master&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s face no longer possess that painful expression, her complexion also turned a lot more mild.</p><p>In fact, when Chu Feng stopped, the complexion of the mother of the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master had become rosy. Although she had not woken up and started to sleep, it was a very sound sleep.</p><p>Furthermore, all of this took Chu Feng less than an hour.</p><p>&#x201C;Young Hero, your art of healing is truly amazing,&#x201D; At that moment, the old lady who served the Valley Master&#x2019;s mother had a joyous expression on her face. She was unable to contain herself from praising Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, without mentioning other things, but merely for the fact that you have treated my mother&#x2019;s illness, I, Bai Xiuzhu, am extremely grateful,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master actually turned to Chu Feng and bowed with clasped fists.</p><p>He, an individual with a status high and above Chu Feng&#x2019;s, was someone who would rarely make such a respectful gesture to another, much less someone with the status of a prisoner like Chu Feng.</p><p>However, he did such a thing. From that, it could be seen how much importance his mother held in his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master&#x2019;s words are too serious. I merely did what I was capable of,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I might as well get right to the point. Are you capable of curing my mother&#x2019;s illness?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Valley Master&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s illness is indeed very dangerous. However, curing her illness is not that hard either. It is not an incurable disease.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, if a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist possessed exquisite ability in the art of healing and wholeheartedly treated her illness, they would also be able to cure her,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Truly? But, all of the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists I&#x2019;ve requested before all said that only an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist could treat her illness,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said.</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps it is because they do not dare to attempt to cure her illness out of a fear of failure. However, Lord Valley Master, you can rest assured. I am able to cure your mother&#x2019;s illness. Furthermore, I do not need to wait until later. I can do it right now,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Right now? You&#x2019;re truly capable of curing her right now?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master was in disbelief.</p><p>&#x201C;To be exact, I must cure her right now. If her treatment is to continue to be delayed, your mother&#x2019;s illness might end up being a danger to her life,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;A danger to her life?&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master frowned.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that Lord Valley Master didn&#x2019;t know that your mother&#x2019;s illness has reached a very dangerous level?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>The way Chu Feng saw it, this Lord Valley Master should know very well about his mother&#x2019;s illness being very serious. Else, he would not have been requesting for and petitioning Immortal-cloak World Spiritists so urgently.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, as long as you are able to cure my mother&#x2019;s illness, even if you have truly killed Chu Luyang, I can treat it as if nothing has happened.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, I will also provide you with rewards. You can make any demand of me,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said.</p><p>Sure enough, it was as Chu Feng had anticipated, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master also knew that his mother&#x2019;s illness was very serious.</p><p>Else, he would not have not questioned Chu Feng, and instead directly proposed rewarding Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;We can set the matter of Chu Luyang aside till later. Right now, the treatment of Lord Valley Master&#x2019;s mother is the most urgent.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, your mother&#x2019;s illness is truly special. Thus, I must use a special method to treat her illness. For that, I will need Lord Valley Master&#x2019;s assistance,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;How should I assist? Please tell me,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master said.</p><p>&#x201C;I will need Lord Valley Master&#x2019;s blood. I am going to completely exchange your mother&#x2019;s blood with yours,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;No problem,&#x201D; The Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Valley Master agreed without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
