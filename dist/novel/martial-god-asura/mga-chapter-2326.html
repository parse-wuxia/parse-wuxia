<p><strong> Chapter 2326 - Straightforward And Upright</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Senior, why did you say that?&#x201D; A curious individual asked.</p><p>&#x201C;For the sake of protecting us, Chu Feng has deliberately contained the energy ripples from his confrontation with Hun Lian, preventing them from becoming too ferocious and injuring us, all while fighting against him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This means that he has a kind heart. Although there are a lot of geniuses, the majority of them are proud and arrogant individuals that only care about themselves, and could care less about the lives and deaths of others.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You can take that Hun Lian as a perfect example. He simply does not care about our lives. In fact, he even intentionally brought harm upon us to show us how powerful he is.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for that Young Master Li Ming, even though his strength surpassed Hun Lian&#x2019;s, and he had not deliberately harmed us, the only thing he cared about was defeating Hun Lian, and thus he did not bother to put a curb on Hun Lian&#x2019;s overbearing behavior.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While it cannot be said that Young Master Li Ming is a bad individual, it could be said that he still possesses the same sort of proud mentality the great majority of geniuses possess. Although he does not do evil, he does not plan to eliminate evil either.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, that Chu Feng is different. I do not feel the same arrogance that other geniuses exhibit from him,&#x201D; That old man began to praise Chu Feng nonstop. The more he praised, the more intensely passionate his gaze became.</p><p>After hearing what that old man said, many of the people from the younger generation realized what Chu Feng was silently doing for them, and began to hold deeper respect toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, with how powerful that Hun Lian is, I truly wonder if Chu Feng will be able to defeat him,&#x201D; As more people began to think highly of Chu Feng, they also began to become increasingly worried for Chu Feng.</p><p>After all, with Hun Lian&#x2019;s moral character, if Chu Feng were to not be a match for him, he would definitely kill Chu Feng and his friends. In fact, even a portion of the bystanders would most definitely be killed by him.</p><p>As for that, it was a result that the crowd did not wish for.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, an ear-piercing rumble sounded from the sky.</p><p>Energy ripples surged on as the rumbling continued. Countless spatial cracks began to appear. Then, space and the void shattered, turning the sky pitch-black.</p><p>Their power was so strong that even space was shattered by it.</p><p>At the moment when space began to reform and the energy ripples began to dissipate, the crowd were finally able to see what had happened.</p><p>Chu Feng and Hun Lian were both standing in the sky. While Chu Feng was completely undamaged, Hun Lian&#x2019;s injuries had grown even more serious. This was especially true for his chest; there was a large hole there. Blood was gushing out of that hole.</p><p>At the same time, Hun Lian&#x2019;s aura had also become increasingly weak. He had already lost the enormous battle power he had displayed earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;He won! Chu Feng actually won!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng won!!!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng defeated Hun Lian!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, cheers sounded from the crowd.</p><p>The crowd was extremely excited. It could be seen how much they wanted Chu Feng to win.</p><p>&#x201C;Impossible! How could you possibly defeat me?!&#x201D; Hun Lian had a sinister expression. He seemed to not be concerned with his injuries at all. Rather, using his unreconciled gaze, he stared at Chu Feng.</p><p>He was still unable to accept being defeated by Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Firstly, I must admit that you&#x2019;re very powerful. At the very least, you are stronger than the current me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;......&#x201D;</p><p>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd&#x2019;s expressions all changed. They were flabbergasted. They did not understand why he would say that he was inferior to Hun Lian when he had defeated Hun Lian.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you insulting me?!&#x201D; Hun Lian grew even more furious.</p><p>Even though he was unwilling to admit that he had been defeated by Chu Feng, he still knew very well that he was defeated by Chu Feng.</p><p>Thus, he felt that Chu Feng saying those words after defeating him was simply insulting him.</p><p>&#x201C;Truth be told, the reason why I am able to defeat you so easily is because I had already seen your various abilities when you fought against Young Master Li Ming earlier. Thus, I already knew how I should handle you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I hadn&#x2019;t personally seen your abilities in your confrontation with Young Master Li Ming, and had instead fought against you without knowing any of your abilities, it would have been impossible for me to defeat you this easily.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then and most importantly, my current cultivation is not my true cultivation,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you implying? Are you trying to tell me that you concealed your cultivation?&#x201D; Hun Lian&#x2019;s expression changed again. It seemed that he was afraid that he would be humiliated again.</p><p>&#x201C;No,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. He shook his head and said, &#x201C;My actual cultivation is that of a rank five Half Martial Ancestor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rank five Half Martial Ancestor?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You said that you&#x2019;re a rank five Half Martial Ancestor?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If that&#x2019;s the case, then what is this cultivation that you have now?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Hun Lian&#x2019;s expression changed enormously. He was completely puzzled.</p><p>&#x201C;My current cultivation is something that I obtained through using a spirit formation,&#x201D; Chu Feng said calmly. He seemed to not feel disgraced for obtaining his cultivation with special means. After all, it was the truth.</p><p>Originally, Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t have to tell Hun Lian or the others about this. However, he knew very well that if he did not rely on the spirit formation and relied only on his actual cultivation, it would have been impossible for him to defeat Hun Lian.</p><p>That was why Chu Feng declared that Hun Lian was stronger than him. After all, if they were to compete with their actual cultivations, even ten thousand Chu Fengs would not be a match for a single Hun Lian.</p><p>That was the truth. As for Chu Feng, he did not wish to conceal that sort of truth.</p><p>&#x201C;Look. Didn&#x2019;t I say that Chu Feng&#x2019;s character is excellent?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng is a straightforward and upright man of character.&#x201D;</p><p>However, unexpectedly, Chu Feng&#x2019;s telling of the truth did not receive denouncements from the crowd. Instead, they started to commend him. They all felt that Chu Feng was a sincere individual.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, Hun Lian burst into loud laughter. He laughed very proudly and arrogantly.</p><p>&#x201C;So you were only able to defeat me by using a spirit formation. In that case, you are nothing more than trash.&#x201D;</p><p>Faced with Chu Feng&#x2019;s candidness, Hun Lian did not feel grateful in the slightest, and instead started to ridicule Chu Feng.</p><p>Xu Yiyi was unable to take it anymore and shouted, &#x201C;How shameless could you be?! Even if Chu Feng&#x2019;s actual cultivation is inferior to yours, you were still defeated by him when your battle power was on par with one another! This means that when Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation manages to catch up to yours in the future, you will still be inferior to him!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. Little friend Chu Feng was open with you, yet you&#x2019;re actually ridiculing him like this. You are truly too excessive. I have never seen someone as shameless as you.&#x201D;</p><p>In fact, even some of the people that were unrelated to Chu Feng were unable to watch anymore. They too began to refute Hun Lian.</p><p>The reason why they dared to refute Hun Lian like this was because they had personally seen that Chu Feng had defeated Hun Lian. As such, they became more confident, and felt that they were backed by Chu Feng.</p><p>Else&#x2026; they would naturally not dare to contradict Hun Lian.</p><p>&#x201C;Who the hell do you all think you all are to meddle in my business? All of you are simply courting death!&#x201D;</p><p>Hun Lian glowered at the crowd. Then, he waved his sleeve and sent forth layer upon layer of martial power. He wanted to completely obliterate all those that dared to contradict him, including Xu Yiyi.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right after Hun Lian&#x2019;s martial power was sent forth, before it could be an actual threat to Xu Yiyi and the others, an even stronger martial power blocked his martial power.</p><p>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had blocked Hun Lian&#x2019;s martial power. Furthermore, using his martial power, Chu Feng sent forth his martial power toward Hun Lian and ended up restricting his movements.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?!&#x201D; Hun Lian started to panic slightly.</p><p>At thatmoment, he was seriously injured. While he was still capable of bullying Xu Yiyi and the others, he already no longer possessed the strength to fight Chu Feng. Merely Chu Feng&#x2019;s ordinary martial power that had restricted him was sufficient to kill him.</p><p>&#x201C;Hun Lian, although I admit that you are very strong, I cannot find a reason to allow someone like you to live,&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to Hun Lian indifferently. There was not a trace of emotion in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;You want to kill me?&#x201D; The panic on Hun Lian&#x2019;s face grew stronger. He knew that Chu Feng was truly capable of killing him.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201D; Once Chu Feng said those words, his killing intent was completely revealed. His ferocious martial power was going to take Hun Lian&#x2019;s life.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
