<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1721 - Could Only Accept Being Defeated</strong></p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s expression immediately changed. The reason for that was because what Chu Feng had said was his life&#x2019;s greatest stain.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong? Do you also plan to say that I&#x2019;m telling lies?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he looked to the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master and asked, &#x201C;Lord Alliance Master, is what Feng Xing said the truth?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What little friend Feng Xing said is indeed the truth. Back then, little friend Dongfang Zexuan had indeed mustered a large force to our World Spiritist Alliance to challenge our World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s younger generation in world spirit techniques.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s world spirit techniques are extremely outstanding. Unfortunately, he was still defeated by our World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s disciple.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There were a lot of people present that day. Many other people from the Nine Powers are capable of testifying to what happened,&#x201D; When the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master said those words, he looked to the other powers of the Nine Powers.</p><p>The reason for that was because Dongfang Zexuan had brought other powers from the Nine Powers with him to root for him as he challenged the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>Unfortunately, after Dongfang Zexuan was defeated, those people who came to support him all fled.</p><p>At that moment, those powers who had gone to support him back then were all lowering their heads. They did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>As for Dongfang Zexuan, his complexion turned blue. His earlier smile was completely gone.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s actually such a thing? Logically, Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s world spirit techniques should be exceptionally powerful among the younger generation. Yet he was still defeated by a member of the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s younger generation?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The World Spiritist Alliance is truly worthy of its title as being the place where the Holy Land of Martialism&#x2019;s strongest world spiritists gather,&#x201D; Seeing that the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master had verified Chu Feng&#x2019;s claim, and the Dongfang Imperial Clan was not refuting it, the crowd all began to believe that Dongfang Zexuan had tried to provoke the World Spiritist Alliance only to suffer a crushing defeat.</p><p>&#x201C;So what if such a thing happened? That was then and this is now. Back then, I was only an Insect Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. And now, I am already a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Alliance, you all can have that disciple who defeated me that day come and fight me again. I refuse to believe that he can defeat me a second time,&#x201D; Dongfang Zexuan shouted.</p><p>Hearing those words, the World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s Alliance Master started to frown. The person who had defeated Dongfang Zexuan before was Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng was no longer in this world. As such, who could the World Spiritist Alliance possibly send out to compete with Dongfang Zexuan?</p><p>Truth be told, not to mention others, even the World Spiritist Immortal&#x2019;s personal disciple, Mu Juechen, would likely lose should he face Dongfang Zexuan.</p><p>&#x201C;You can challenge the World Spiritist Alliance anytime. However, right now, you must accept my challenge first.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng spoke. As a disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance, he would naturally help the World Spiritist Alliance out of trouble.</p><p>Merely, at this moment, none of the people from the World Spiritist Alliance, including even that World Spiritist Immortal, knew who Chu Feng was.</p><p>Thus, when they saw how Chu Feng was helping them, they all nodded in their hearts. Their impression of Chu Feng became a lot more favorable.</p><p>&#x201C;Come! I&#x2019;ve accepted your challenge; do you dare to accept my challenge? Without the use of martial power, we shall compete with world spirit techniques. I ask you again, do you dare to accept my challenge?&#x201D;</p><p>Dongfang Zexuan was completely enraged by Chu Feng, and lost his patience. However, he firmly insisted on competing using only world spirit techniques. After all, he truly did not have any certainty in being able to defeat Chu Feng with martial power.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you certain you wish to compete with me using world spirit techniques?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I only fear that you will not dare,&#x201D; Dongfang Zexuan said.</p><p>&#x201C;Aouuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Once Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s words left his mouth, a roar sounded from Chu Feng&#x2019;s direction. As his long hair fluttered, boundless world spirit power surged forth from Chu Feng&#x2019;s body.</p><p>At the moment when his world spirit power appeared, it turned into countless ferocious beasts. Even though all of the ferocious beasts were golden in appearance, they all possessed different physical appearances.</p><p>There were giant elephants, fierce tigers, pythons and dragons.</p><p>There were those that possessed three heads and six limbs, those with enormous eyes and those with boundless power.</p><p>These were no ordinary beasts. Rather, they appeared more like Heaven&#x2019;s Divine Beasts and Hell&#x2019;s Demon Beasts.</p><p>&#x201C;Such ferocious might, are they really formed with world spirit techniques?&#x201D;</p><p>Once Chu Feng unleashed his world spirit technique, the crowd became completely shocked.</p><p>Not to mention the outsiders who didn&#x2019;t know much about world spirit techniques, even the experts from the World Spiritist Alliance, the Compass Immortal, the Avaricious Immortal, the World Spiritist Immortal and the White-browed Immortal began to reveal expressions of shock.</p><p>The reason for that was because the world spirit technique that Chu Feng had unleashed was most definitely not something as simple as changing the form of his world spirit power. Rather, it was a spirit formation, a world spirit technique&#x2019;s slaughtering formation.</p><p>Furthermore, the one he had used was exceptionally powerful!!!</p><p>&#x201C;This guy, how can this be?!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, when even the bystanders were shocked, Dongfang Zexuan would naturally also be shocked.</p><p>He had thought himself to possess outstanding attainments in world spirit techniques, and had never thought that Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques would be this powerful. He was feeling an enormous threat from Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation.</p><p>At this moment, he wanted to escape. However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation had completely covered the entire stage. There was already nowhere for him to escape to. The only way for him to get away from Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation was by going backwards. However, if he were to do that, he would end up leaving the stage, the equivalent of defeat.</p><p>At this moment, he was regretting. He truly regretted challenging Chu Feng to a match of world spirit techniques.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s enormously powerful world spirit technique was simply not something that he could contend against. If he had known this was going to happen, he would&#x2019;ve chosen to fight against Chu Feng with martial power.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was already too late.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it.&#x201D;</p><p>With no other way out, Dongfang Zexuan could only go all out and stake everything to defend. Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s hands began to change rapidly. World spirit formations began to form in rapid succession. In an instant, from inside to outside, from small to large, a total of eighteen defensive barriers surrounded him like a golden fort that protected him from all around.</p><p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation arrived. Like a golden tide that could wreck everything in its path, Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit formation swept toward Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s defensive barriers with earth-shattering might. In a blink of an eye, they completely engulfed Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s defensive barriers.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, other than the sound of giant beasts trampling through, the sound of something being shattered could be heard.</p><p>It was only when the tide of giant beasts trampled past the stage and galloped toward the horizon with magnificent might that the crowd saw Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s silhouette again.</p><p>At this moment, Dongfang Zexuan was still on the stage. However, he was no longer standing. Instead, he had fallen on the stage.</p><p>His body was crushed flat. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the fact that he possessed a powerful cultivation, having one&#x2019;s body crushed flat, he would&#x2019;ve already been utterly dead.</p><p>However, even though Dongfang Zexuan possessed a very powerful cultivation, he was still only barely hanging on by a breath. His injuries were extremely serious.</p><p>&#x201C;Feng Xing, this is merely a sparring match. Is there a need for you to use such a ruthless attack?&#x201D; At this moment, the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan were enraged. The reason for that was because Dongfang Zexuan was really very seriously injured. In fact, even his cultivation might suffer damage from this.</p><p>&#x201C;I am already being lenient. Else, instead of being injured right now, he would be dead.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let alone, &#x2018;the victor is the king and the loser is the thief.&#x2019; That is something that your Third Prince himself said. If you cannot afford to lose, then you shouldn&#x2019;t fight to begin with,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;I believe what little friend Feng Xing said to be reasonable,&#x201D; said the World Spiritist Immortal.</p><p>&#x201C;I also think it to be reasonable,&#x201D; The White-browed Immortal also nodded his head in agreement.</p><p>&#x201C;It is indeed reasonable,&#x201D; Even the Compass Immortal, the person with the most celebrated status, spoke for Chu Feng.</p><p>When even the Three Immortals spoke for him, the number of people who began to speak out for Chu Feng grew even more numerous.</p><p>In an instant, the name &#x2018;Feng Xing&#x2019; began to resonate through the crowd.</p><p>As matters stood, the crowd was all able to realize that this young man called Feng Xing was someone with an extraordinary origin.</p><p>Facing such a young man, everyone&#x2019;s first reaction would naturally be to obtain a good relationship with him in order to pave a road for the future.</p><p>When everyone was speaking out for Chu Feng, even though the Dongfang Imperial Clan was very unreconciled, they had no choice but to shut their mouths and watch as Chu Feng walked down from the stage with a smile on his face without being able to do anything to him.</p><p>They had no choice but to accept being defeated.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
