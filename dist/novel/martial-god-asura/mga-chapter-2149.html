<p><strong> Chapter 2149 - Newcomer</strong></p><p>Everything in around him was rapidly changing. However, Chu Feng was not moving at all. It was as if his hands and legs were restricted; as if he was in a river current, and could only blindly follow it.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was able to see the changes happening to his surroundings. At the beginning, his surrounding had been covered with golden light. However, the golden light soon turned into darkness. Even though it had turned to darkness, there were many faint lights passing through him nonstop. In fact, he was even able to sense that there were a lot of such lights; so many that they were simply innumerable.</p><p>Merely, the speed at which Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were traveling was simply too fast. As such, Chu Feng was simply unable to see anything clearly.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had a guess in his heart. He felt those lights to be stars. Chu Feng had already left the Eastern Sea Region. To be exact, he had left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm and entered the vast starry sky.</p><p>That is, he had entered the Outer World.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, the place before Chu Feng was no longer an endless tunnel. Instead, a ray of light appeared.</p><p>That ray of light appeared like the bright sun. Blazing heat was soon felt.</p><p>Soon, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were basked in the light and heat. It was as if they had entered the sun itself. That sort of feeling was very unpleasant.</p><p>However, that feeling persisted for only a split second before disappearing. At the same time, the dazzling light also disappeared.</p><p>Soon, Chu Feng discovered that the binding feeling on his hands and legs had also disappeared.</p><p>Furthermore, when he looked to his surroundings, he was joyous to discover that he was currently on a sea floor.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve a-a-arrived at the O-O-Outer World?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked Chu Feng. Unconcealable excitement filled his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Wouldn&#x2019;t we know once we go out?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, his body shifted as he and Wang Qiang rapidly soared upward.</p><p>&#x201C;Splash~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Waves of water splashed across the sea as Chu Feng and Wang Qiang soared into the sky like two dragons.</p><p>However, there was no one in their surroundings. Above them was a vast blue sky and white clouds. Below them was a sea as far as the eye could see. The waves of the sea surged high into the sky and rumbled as they crashed back into the sea.</p><p>&#x201C;T-the h-hell?! I-I-Isn&#x2019;t this the E-Eastern Sea R-Region?!&#x201D; Wang Qiang&#x2019;s mouth was wide open. He had a disappointed expression.</p><p>&#x201C;No, this place should be the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;H-How do you k-know that?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Sense the Natural Energies in this place. They&#x2019;re so plentiful and dense. Not to mention the Eastern Sea Region, even the Holy Land of Martialism is greatly inferior to this place,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Wang Qiang closed his eyes and began to carefully sense the Natural Energies in his surroundings. Then, he opened his eyes and revealed an excited expression. He said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s t-true! In t-that case, this place is r-really not the Eastern Sea Region but the H-H-Hundred R-Refinements O-Ordinary Realm?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;T-Then, where are we at now? Is this t-the H-Hundred Refinements S-Stage or w-whatever that y-you spoke of? B-But, why are o-only the two of us h-here?&#x201D; Wang Qiang asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s only two possibilities for that&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;One, this place is enormous. Thus, even though we are in the Hundred Refinements Stage, we are unable to find anyone in our surroundings.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Two, the Stairway to Heaven that we used avoided the guidance power. Thus, while we are in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, we have simply bypassed the Hundred Refinements Stage,&#x201D; Chu Feng explained.</p><p>&#x201C;T-That&#x2019;s true. F-Forget about it. D-Doesn&#x2019;t matter w-where this is, let&#x2019;s g-go check t-things out,&#x201D; Wang Qiang surveyed his surroundings. Then, his body shifted. He pointed to a direction and said, &#x201C;Come, l-let&#x2019;s go t-this way. It&#x2019;s c-closer to the coast.&#x201D;</p><p>After he finished saying those words, Wang Qiang began to proceed toward the direction he chose.</p><p>&#x2018;Quite skillful.&#x2019;</p><p>In response, Chu Feng praised in his heart. Although they were both world spiritists, being able to differentiate one&#x2019;s surroundings and determine which direction was closer to the coast when placed in the middle of a vast sea like this was not something that everyone could accomplish.</p><p>While Chu Feng was able to accomplish it, he did not expect that Wang Qiang would also be capable of it.</p><p>After seeing that Wang Qiang possessed this sort of ability, Chu Feng grew a bit more confident. After all, it would be beneficial for the two of them to possess more abilities when entering this unknown Outer World together.</p><p>The two men flew toward the direction Wang Qiang had indicated. Sure enough, as they approached the coast, a city came into view.</p><p>The city was not very large. However, there were plenty of people moving about in it. It was a very lively city.</p><p>After seeing the people in the city, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were both extremely excited. It was as if they had discovered a new world.</p><p>Although they were all humans, it remained that the people of this place were from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>The first thing Chu Feng did was to survey the cultivation of these people. He wanted to have a general understanding of what sort of cultivations the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm possessed.</p><p>Upon surveying the crowd, Chu Feng discovered that the people in this city, regardless of their gender or age, were practically all martial cultivators. As for their cultivations, they numbered from high to low.</p><p>However, a thing worthy of being mentioned was that even the weakest adults were Martial Kings. Furthermore, there were a lot of Half Martial Emperor-level experts.</p><p>Of course&#x2026; there were also Martial Emperor-level experts. Merely, they numbered very few.</p><p>Furthermore, whenever a Martial Emperor appeared, the rest of the people looked to them with gazes of reverence. This meant that Martial Emperors were people with a certain amount of status in this place.</p><p>It should also be pointed out that the majority of the people in Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&#x2019;s line of sight that were capable of becoming Martial Emperors were older than a hundred years old.</p><p>As rank one Half Martial Ancestors, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were much superior to the people here.</p><p>Merely, as the two men did not deliberately reveal their auras, no one took notice of them.</p><p>After all, the two of them were only two young men in their early twenties. They were still very young even for the younger generation.</p><p>To the people that had lived for hundreds or thousands of years, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang could not even be considered youngsters. In fact, they were no different from two babies.</p><p>&#x201C;W-What&#x2019;s this? H-Here I t-thought this p-place would be a-a-amazing. Turns out i-it&#x2019;s only this much.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With o-only these g-guys here, I can c-crush a w-whole bunch w-with a s-single f-f-fart. S-Sigh, t-this is n-no c-c-c-challenge at all,&#x201D; Wang Qiang said with a disappointed expression.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve just arrived here. What we are seeing here is merely the tip of the iceberg. As such, we naturally cannot determine much from this.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Furthermore, Martial Emperors were grand existences in the Holy Land of Martialism. They are not people that were easily encountered.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Yet, this place is merely a city. However, this mere city possesses Martial Emperors. Doesn&#x2019;t this mean that this place has a lot of Martial Emperors?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The way I see it, the people here might only be ordinary martial cultivators. For ordinary martial cultivators to be able to become Martial Emperors, that in itself is extremely extraordinary,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;I-If y-you say it like that, it d-does seem to b-be the case,&#x201D; Wang Qiang felt what Chu Feng said to be very reasonable.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, an ear-piercing tolling of bells could be heard. They were sounding from the direction of the sea.</p><p>&#x201C;This is bad! It&#x2019;s the people from Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion. Everyone, quickly, run away.&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing that bell, two distinct reactions emerged from the people in the city. One was panic, and the other was joy.</p><p>Chu Feng discovered that some people were already kneeling on the ground. They were kneeling and kowtowing in the direction where the tolling was coming from. They were all people with joyous expressions on their faces.</p><p>&#x201C;Quickly, we gotta go, we gotta go.&#x201D;</p><p>At the same time, the people that had panicked expressions on their faces hurriedly escaped to take shelter.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
