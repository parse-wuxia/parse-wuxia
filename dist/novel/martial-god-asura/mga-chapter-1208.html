<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1208 - Who Did This?</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Elder Wei, there&#x2019;s actually a matter that Chu Feng wishes to inquire of you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Speak away, there is no harm in asking,&#x201D; Elder Wei replied with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I have received a Martial Skill from the Martial Skills Department. This Martial Skill&#x2019;s name is the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield. According to Elder Shi, this Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield requires Firmament Energy in order to train it, and that it just so happens that one can extract Firmament Energy from Firmament Medicinal Herbs.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, Elder Wei, I wanted to ask you why the Firmament Medicinal Herbs would be related to a Martial Skill. Could it be that the Firmament Medicinal Herbs possess extraordinary origins?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked curiously.</p><p>However, after Elder Wei heard what Chu Feng said, he started to frown, and worry was written all over his face. &#x201C;Chu Feng, you truly want to learn that Martial Skill?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This Chu Feng has already made a firm resolution to learn this Martial Skill. However, Elder, please rest assured, Chu Feng also knows about how difficult this Martial Skill is. If Chu Feng is unable to grasping it in a short period of time, Chu Feng will definitely not waste time. If necessary, I will give up on it,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, since this is the case, then go ahead and give it a try.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you truly want to learn the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield, then you would really need the Firmament Energy from the Firmament Medicinal Herbs. As for that Firmament Energy, I have an abundant amount of it here.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Here, take these. However, you can only use three pellets a day at the very most when training, so definitely do not take too many. Otherwise, the Firmament Energy will intrude on your body and cause harm to it.&#x201D; As Elder Wei spoke, he took out a jade bottle and handed it over to Chu Feng.</p><p>When Chu Feng opened the bottle, he discovered that it was filled with sparkling and translucent medicinal pellets that were emitting a very strong and familiar aura; the Firmament Energy.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you Elder Wei.&#x201D; Chu Feng courteously expressed his thanks with a salute. He could imagine that it must&#x2019;ve taken Elder Wei quite a bit of time to concoct all of these medicinal pellets.</p><p>&#x201C;Why are you still acting so courteous toward me? There&#x2019;s no need for that. After you&#x2019;re done using these, come back to me to get some more.&#x201D; Elder Wei casually waved his hand. However, immediately afterward, he said, &#x201C;Earlier, you had asked me about the origins of the Firmament Medicinal Herb. I cannot be certain about its origins. However, I have heard that the Firmament Medicinal Herb is also called the Demon Herb.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;According to legend, the Demon Herbs originated from the Ancient Era. As for the rest, I am uncertain about it. Essentially, the Firmament Medicinal Herbs are extremely unusual. Although they are great for concocting medicines and refining weapons, they are filled with a demonic nature.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Many years ago, there was an elder from the Weaponry Refinement Department who would use Firmament Energy to assist in weaponry refinement every single time. Furthermore, the amount that he would use was extremely enormous.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Over time, the Firmament Energy entered his body and caused his mind to go berserk. With that, he turned mad, started killing fellow disciples, and no one was able to stop him at all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In the end, with no other choice, Lord Headmaster personally acted and beheaded him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Because of this, there were people who guessed that because the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield possessed Firmament Energy, it was very possible that it was not something created by someone from the righteous path,&#x201D; Elder Wei said.</p><p>&#x201C;So that was the case.&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng nodded. It would appear that Elder Wei unfortunately did not know a lot about the Firmament Medicinal Herbs.</p><p>However, this was fine. After all, Chu Feng had already determined in his heart that the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield was related to the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash. Merely that was sufficient for him.</p><p>His purpose in coming to the Medicine Concocting Department was firstly to inquire about the Firmament Medicinal Herbs, as he was very curious about their usage ever since he saw Jiang Furong using them to train.</p><p>However, his main purpose was to obtain Firmament Energy from Elder Wei.</p><p>That was because the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield was different from the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash. Not only was the method of learning it much more complicated, it was much more difficult too. Thus, it was necessary to use Firmament Energy from the Firmament Medicinal Herbs to assist him in training.</p><p>In fact, Chu Feng had once thought about using the Firmament Adamantine Metal to assist in training the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield.</p><p>That was because the Firmament Adamantine Metal also contained Firmament Energy. Furthermore, the energy in it was extremely dense.</p><p>However, upon thinking about it, he decided against it. After all, the Firmament Adamantine Metal he had was a true treasure and remnants of the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s ancestor.</p><p>If he was to truly use the Firmament Adamantine Metal to train, then it might lead to the Firmament Energy within the Firmament Adamantine Metal becoming impure. Thus, after much consideration, Chu Feng decided to use the Firmament Medicinal Herbs to train.</p><p>After this matter regarding the Firmament Medicinal Herbs, Chu Feng chatted with Elder Wei for a long time. While chatting, Chu Feng also inquired about the boundary energy.</p><p>The boundary energy is a kind of energy that separated the Holy Land of Martialism into many different sections. It was very similar to a world spirit formation. Yet, it was also different from it.</p><p>Chu Feng came across boundary energy because he had wanted to go to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. While it was true that going to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest or not was up to his decision, Chu Feng was not someone who would stay in the Cyanwood Domain the entire time. Thus, he was still interested in learning about what sort of methods there were to breaking apart the boundary energy.</p><p>&#x201C;Boundary energy originated from the Ancient Era. No one knows if it was formed by nature or man-made.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In short, the boundary energy is no ordinary world spirit formation. While Martial Emperors and Royal-cloak World Spiritists could break apart it, no one else other than them could.&#x201D; This was Elder Wei&#x2019;s explanation.</p><p>However, from this, Chu Feng also realized some things. That was that there were different tiers of strength for Royal-cloak World Spiritists. As for the difference in strength, it was differentiated by their spirit power.</p><p>Reportedly, there were three different types of veined patterns to Royal-cloak World Spiritists. The first veined pattern was that of a little bug. The second was that of a little snake, and the third was a little dragon.</p><p>Thus, they ended up being known as Insect Mark, Snake Mark and Dragon Mark.</p><p>Undoubtedly, between the three, it was naturally the Insect Mark that was the weakest and the Dragon Mark that was the strongest.</p><p>However, according to Elder Wei, it was extremely difficult for one to link to royal spirit power. Not only did it require one to have powerful strength, one also had to be gifted.</p><p>He said that Elder Xiahou and he himself had trained for hundreds of years and specialized in world spirit techniques. Yet, even now, they were incapable of linking to royal spirit power, causing them to remain Gold-cloak World Spiritists.</p><p>However, they felt that Chu Feng&#x2019;s spirit power was extremely strong, and that he would most definitely be able to become a Royal-cloak World Spiritist in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to express his high opinion toward Chu Feng, Elder Wei actually gifted Chu Feng a Medicine Concocting Cauldron. Just by looking at it, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Medicine Concocting Cauldron was a cauldron not inferior to the Golden Dragon Cauldron, a priceless treasure.</p><p>Originally, Chu Feng did not want to accept it. As it goes, one should not accept an undeserved reward. To be presented with such a precious gift truly caused him to feel that it was hard to accept.</p><p>However, Elder Wei insisted on giving it to him. Thus, it was unfitting for Chu Feng to reject it. In the end, he could only glady accept the Medicine Refining Cauldron.</p><p>At the same time, Chu Feng made the firm decision in his mind to meticulously study medicine concocting techniques so as to not lose face for the Medicine Concocting Department.</p><p>After all, Elder Wei was the first person to make Chu Feng feel the warmth of home after he had come to the Cyanwood Mountain.</p><p>Chu Feng chatted with Elder Wei deep into the night. Due to the fact that it was too late and Elder Wei was insisting that he stay, Chu Feng did not return to his own territory and stayed the night in the Medicine Concocting Department.</p><p>Early morning the next day, Chu Feng returned to his territory. However, he never would&#x2019;ve imagined that in less than a day since he had left, a major event occurred in the Asura Division.</p><p>All of the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s disciples in the Asura Division were beaten up, and very severely on top of that.</p><p>This was not only limited to Fang Tuohai and the other old disciples, even Wang Wei and the other disciples who had joined the Cyanwood Mountain alongside Chu Feng were beaten.</p><p>Chu Feng was still able to bear it as he saw the battered and bloodied appearances of the male disciples. However, when he saw that Wang Wei and the female disciples were actually badly battered too, Chu Feng was incapable of enduring it.</p><p>&#x201C;Who did this? Who did this?!&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s anger was overflowing and his killing intent was surging. At this moment, he was truly capable of killing someone.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s, it&#x2019;s, it&#x2019;s&#x2026;&#x201D; Fang Tuohai, Wang Wei and the others hesitated over and over again. They did not dare to answer Chu Feng.</p><p>They were afraid. For one, they were afraid of the opponent, afraid that the opponent was too powerful, so powerful that Chu Feng would not be able to handle them.</p><p>Secondly, they were afraid of Chu Feng. Due to Chu Feng&#x2019;s extremely hot-blooded nature, they feared that he would do something drastic.</p><p>After all, as things had reached this point, they had, to a greater or lesser degree, understood Chu Feng&#x2019;s character. If Chu Feng was truly enraged, he would truly kill someone. After all, he had already previously killed elders in the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
