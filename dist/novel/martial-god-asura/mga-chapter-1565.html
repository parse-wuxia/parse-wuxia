<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1565 - Young Hero, Help Me</strong></p><p>Nangong Baihe wanted to bring Moli away. Chu Feng did not stop them. That was because he knew that he could not stop them.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble, rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Only a short moment after Nangong Baihe began to bring Moli away, an ear-piercing rumble suddenly sounded from the distant waters. The rumbling sounded like the cries of ten thousand bears or a dragon trampling on the sea.</p><p>Turning toward the direction of the voice, Chu Feng saw an enormous wave that reached a thousand meters tall surging toward them.</p><p>That wave was enormous. Before it, ordinary waves were like little shrimps encountering a gigantic whale. They were simply incomparable.</p><p>Not only was that wave enormous and overbearing, but contained within the wave were countless enormous sea monsters. The weakest among them were rank one Half Martial Emperors. As for the strongest, they were rank five Half Martial Emperors.</p><p>They were densely packed, and there were too many to be counted. From a guess, it appeared that there were at least several thousand or even over ten thousand such enormous and ferocious sea monsters. Each and every one of them had murderous appearances, as if they were searching for people to kill.</p><p>As for the most frightening matter, being pounded by the waves, those sea monsters were extremely fast. It was likely that the wave would soon swallow up Chu Feng and the others completely. Even if they wanted to escape, it would be extremely difficult for them to do so.</p><p>&#x201C;Damn it, where did all these sea monsters come from? Is that giant wave still formed by a spirit formation? It possesses such enormous might! It is only to reach a single Immortal Island, was there a need to make things so difficult?&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Baihe&#x2019;s expression turned gloomy. However, she was not scared witless. Instead, she started to complain. Then, she suddenly grabbed onto Nangong Moli, threw her to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll trouble you with this. Bring my younger sister and escape. Get away from this sea and return to the golden beach. At that time, my Nangong Imperial Clan will definitely provide you with ample rewards.&#x201D;</p><p>After she finished saying those words, Nangong Baihe grabbed tightly onto her curved blade. She unleashed her boundless Half Martial Emperor&#x2019;s aura and began to walk toward the incoming wave.</p><p>&#x201C;Why, are you planning to face it with your life on the line?&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a light smile. At this moment, Chu Feng had a trace of a favorable impression toward this arrogant Nangong Baihe.</p><p>The reason for that was because she had chosen not to flee during this moment of life and death and instead, for the sake of her younger sister, had chosen to face the incoming disaster and sacrifice her own life in order to fight for an opportunity to let her younger sister live.</p><p>&#x201C;Quickly, scram. I will only be able to stop them for a moment. If you do not escape right now, you&#x2019;ll all die here. While your death might not matter, do not cause my lil sis to die too.&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Baihe turned her head around and angrily shouted at Chu Feng. Then, she turned her head forward again and spoke no more.</p><p>At this moment, the power she released became stronger and stronger. A golden-bright and dazzling &#x2018;emperor&#x2019; character appeared on her forehead. She had activated her Imperial Bloodline. Thus, her aura began to become even more powerful. At this moment, she was infinitely close to a rank two Half Martial Emperor. However, it was only approaching and not having actually reached the level of rank two Half Martial Emperor. That said, this should be the limit to Nangong Baihe&#x2019;s strength.</p><p>&#x201C;I can do it. They&#x2019;re merely sea monsters formed by spirit formations. They&#x2019;re not real. I am the grand sixth young miss of the Nangong Imperial Clan. How can I possibly not be able to handle them?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No, it won&#x2019;t do. I know that I&#x2019;m no match for them, yet I&#x2019;m still trying to show off. I&#x2019;ll die.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But, why fear death? As long as lil sis can continue to live, there will be hope. Mother will not have died in vain.&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Baihe was conflicting with herself. The reason for that was because she did not wish to die. Even though she knew that what she was going to do would undoubtedly kill her, she was still choosing to do it. The reason for that was because she had her own conviction. Her younger sister was her conviction, her hope.</p><p>&#x201C;Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when Nangong Baihe decided to face death with equanimity, a voice suddenly sounded from behind her. Following that, an extremely ferocious aura surged forth from behind her.</p><p>&#x201C;That guy!!!&#x201D;</p><p>When Nangong Baihe turned her head around, her expression immediately changed. Her mouth was wide open. Her eyes were wide open. She was deeply shocked.</p><p>That was because, at this moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s long hair was drifting, and his clothes were fluttering. Holding onto the Infinity Edge, he was walking on the sea and toward her one step at a time.</p><p>Furthermore, at this moment, layer upon layer of crimson gaseous flames were revolving around him. Those gaseous flames were extremely strange. Like snakes, they were letting out strange and extremely frightening hissing sounds. However, these gaseous flames caused Chu Feng to appear exceptionally powerful.</p><p>Facing Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura, even Nangong Baihe felt an enormous sense of oppression. Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura was no longer that of rank eight Martial King. Instead, he had became a rank one Half Martial Emperor.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng had arrived before Nangong Baihe. As for that enormous wave that contained countless sea monsters, it was also growing closer and closer.</p><p>&#x201C;Eight successive slashes.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng began to brandish his Infinity Edge. In an instant, eight crimson slashes flew out from the Infinity Edge Chu Feng held in his hand. They landed onto that sea wave like a storm.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>In an instant, ear-piercing explosions began to sound nonstop. The violent energy ripples continued to form. Wave upon wave of violent wind began to surge toward Chu Feng&#x2019;s direction. Not only did they cause the waves underneath their feet to surge violently, they also caused Nangong Moli and Nangong Baihe&#x2019;s footing to become unstable.</p><p>However, Chu Feng, although he was standing at the forefront of the incoming violent wind, even though he was being met with the crushing wind and surging waves, he was not moved in the slightest. In fact, not even a single drop of water landed on him.</p><p>At this moment, Nangong Baihe&#x2019;s eyes were shining even brighter, and her shock grew even stronger. She actually began to feel as if the person standing before her was not someone from the younger generation like herself, but was instead an exceptional expert, a peak martial cultivator.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be? This guy&#x2019;s aura, how could it be this powerful? Exactly what are his origins?&#x201D;</p><p>Nangong Baihe was truly shocked. As she was the Nangong Clan&#x2019;s young miss, she knew of many things. Thus, she knew that the aura that Chu Feng was emitting right now was the most remarkable aura for cultivators.</p><p>This sort of aura could be innate or acquired. However, the more powerful the aura was, the more one had to pay to attain it, and the harder it would be to attain.</p><p>At this moment, the aura that Chu Feng was emitting was something that no one in all of the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s younger generation possessed.</p><p>This caused Nangong Baihe to feel that it was inconceivable, and become skeptical as to whether she was seeing an illusion. She did not dare to believe that Chu Feng could possess this sort of aura.</p><p>Finally, everything came to an end.</p><p>The violent winds stopped blowing. The ocean waves stopped surging. This region of water had become extremely calm. There was not the slightest trace of movement. The surrounding area was so frighteningly tranquil.</p><p>All of this was affected by Chu Feng&#x2019;s aura.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow! Big sister, look, didn&#x2019;t I say that big brother was amazing? He only used a couple slashes, and actually killed all of those sea monsters. He&#x2019;s even more amazing than you, big sister,&#x201D; At this moment, Nangong Moli began to praise Chu Feng without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>&#x201C;Never would I have expected that you were this powerful. I underestimated you,&#x201D; Nangong Baihe walked over to Chu Feng. The gaze with which she looked at Chu Feng had completely changed. Even though she was still on guard, she had become much more gentle toward him.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng laughed lightly. He put his Infinity Edge away and did not bother to answer Nangong Baihe.</p><p>&#x201C;Seeing that you&#x2019;re quite powerful, I&#x2019;ll give you an opportunity. Protect my lil sis and me until we encounter the people from my Nangong Clan or reach the Immortal Island,&#x201D; Nangong Baihe continued.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d suggest you return. A place like this is truly not suited for a young miss like yourself,&#x201D; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he turned around to leave.</p><p>&#x201C;You really do not plan to help us?&#x201D; Nangong Baihe asked.</p><p>Chu Feng ignored her and continued onward.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Nangong Baihe took a step and leapt toward Chu Feng.</p><p>Chu Feng abruptly turned around. His gaze became fierce. If Nangong Baihe were to attack him, he would definitely not be polite toward her.</p><p>However, right after Nangong Baihe reached him, she actually fell down before Chu Feng, extended her arms widely and tightly grabbed onto Chu Feng&#x2019;s thigh. With her head raised, a pitiful expression and wide open eyes, she looked to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Young Hero, please, please be kind-hearted. Please help us sisters. We have no one to rely on. In this sea, we will be all alone and impoverished. If you refuse to help us, even if we do not get eaten by the sea monsters, we will be smashed to death by the waves.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng was stunned. Unable to help himself, his expression took a huge change. Nangong Baihe&#x2019;s current action was a complete change compared to her actions before. The change was so great that Chu Feng was unable to accept it.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
