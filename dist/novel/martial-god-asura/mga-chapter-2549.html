<p><strong>Chapter 2549 - Zi Xunyi</strong></p><p>&#x201C;This girl is truly an ice beauty. She is even colder than that Tantai Xue,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile.</p><p>She had said those words deliberately to tease Chu Feng. After all, it was Chu Feng&#x2019;s one joking comment that had caused Li Yue&#x2019;er to become completely silent.</p><p>&#x201C;Generally, those that are cold will all have gone through extraordinary experiences. Likely, it is also the case with her,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps. However, although she&#x2019;s cold, her name is quite sweet-sounding.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Li Yue&#x2019;er, I am fond of that name,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>Afterwards, Chu Feng no longer tried to continue to invite a snub and stopped trying to speak to Li Yue&#x2019;er.</p><p>When he felt bored, Chu Feng started to speak to Her Lady Queen.</p><p>As for Her Lady Queen, perhaps it was because her cultivation had reached a breakthrough to rank nine Martial Ancestor, but her mood was very good.</p><p>As he chatted with Her Lady Queen, who was in a very good mood, Chu Feng&#x2019;s mood also improved.</p><p>He felt as if he had forgotten about Li Yue&#x2019;er ignoring him, forgotten about all the unpleasantries.</p><p>Time passed rapidly. Soon, the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation was completed.</p><p>However, Chu Feng felt that they had not spent a long time to finish it.</p><p>Of course, Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist now. Furthermore, he was setting up the spirit formation together with Li Yue&#x2019;er. As such, the speed at which they completed the spirit formation would naturally be much faster than when he did it with Wang Qiang back then.</p><p>That said, it remained that setting up a spirit formation was a tasking effort. The fact that Chu Feng was chatting with Her Lady Queen had most definitely contributed to why Chu Feng was able to remain so relaxed after setting up the spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;Judging from the time, the grand sealing formation should have stopped its activation by now. We can leave now,&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er finally spoke again.</p><p>As she spoke, she gave Chu Feng a bead created from the completed spirit formation.</p><p>It was the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation. Like last time, only two spirit formation beads were formed from the completed spirit formation. Upon using them, they would be able allow two people to conceal themselves.</p><p>Even True Immortals would not be able to discover them.</p><p>&#x201C;You can leave first. I still have something that I must take care of,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Li Yue&#x2019;er.</p><p>&#x201C;I would have nearly forgotten if you didn&#x2019;t mention it. Why did you come to this Demon Elimination Cave?&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I have come to find a person,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Who?&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Zi Xunyi. Have you heard of her?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s her?&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Seems like you&#x2019;ve heard of her,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled faintly.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, I know of her. Why are you finding her?&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I am finding her to request her assistance in one thing. Do you know whether or not she&#x2019;s still in the Demon Elimination Cave?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;She is. Merely, there is one thing that I must tell you,&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er said.</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Zi Xunyi and the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan are accomplices,&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er said.</p><p>&#x201C;Accomplices?&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed.</p><p>Evidently, he had already offended the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan earlier.</p><p>He did not merely drive out the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen.</p><p>He had also used one of the two Sacred Temple Beads that Li Yue&#x2019;er had stolen from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan.</p><p>Although it might not have been intentional, it remained that Chu Feng had enjoyed the stolen goods together with Li Yue&#x2019;er. The two of them were already accomplices.</p><p>Thus, it could be said that he had already become the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s enemy.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you still planning to find her now?&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I have no other choice. I must go and find her. I hope that Zi Xunyi is able to consider old affections and spare me on behalf of that individual,&#x201D; Chu Feng said in a slightly helpless manner.</p><p>He could only entrust his life and death to the old affections between Zi Xunyi and Ying Mingchao.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, I&#x2019;ll accompany you,&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er said.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed upon hearing those words. He hurriedly opened his mouth to speak against it.</p><p>After all, it was undetermined whether or not he would be able to survive the journey. All of it would depend on how deep the friendship between Zi Xunyi and Ying Mingchao was.</p><p>If it was deep, he could survive.</p><p>It it was shallow, he would die.</p><p>It could be said that it was a gamble, a gamble with one&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Chu Feng did not wish for Li Yue&#x2019;er to undergo such a gamble together with him.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to advise me against it. No one will be able to change what I&#x2019;ve decided.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You also do not have to worry for me. My status is a bit special. Even if the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan is to truly capture me, they will absolutely not dare to do anything to me.&#x201D;</p><p>As Li Yue&#x2019;er said those words, she revealed a confident, proud and conceited expression.</p><p>&#x201C;It would appear that what this girl says is true. Since she is determined to protect you, you should accept her kind intentions and allow her to accompany you,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.</p><p>Her Lady Queen had managed to tell that Li Yue&#x2019;er wanted to accompany Chu Feng to protect him. After all, her background was extremely powerful, so powerful that the Bloodscale Monstrous Beasts would not dare to do anything to her. Thus, with her accompanying Chu Feng, even if that Zi Xunyi was to ignore her old affections with Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng would still be able to live.</p><p>&#x201C;I suspect that I will not be able to persuade you against it. In that case, let&#x2019;s go together,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng and Li Yue&#x2019;er both stepped onto the path to the depths of the Demon Elimination Cave.</p><p>On their way there, Chu Feng came to find out from Li Yue&#x2019;er that the depths of the Demon Elimination Cave was the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s headquarters.</p><p>In order to prevent accidents from happening, Chu Feng and Li Yue&#x2019;er used their Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation beads upon approaching the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s headquarters.</p><p>Chu Feng knew that if they were discovered by the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan, they would definitely be killed.</p><p>Thus, the strategy that they had in mind was very simple. They were going to use the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation to infiltrate the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s headquarters.</p><p>Chu Feng planned to find Zi Xunyi directly and inform her of the situation at hand. He hoped that Zi Xunyi would take Ying Mingchao into consideration and spare him and Li Yue&#x2019;er. Most importantly, he hoped that Zi Xunyi would agree to go and help Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Upon infiltrating the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s headquarters, Chu Feng uttered in a surprised manner, &#x201C;This&#x2026; are they having a wedding? With such a great disposition of forces, it seems that someone important in the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan is going to get married.&#x201D;</p><p>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s headquarters was decorated with lanterns and colored banners. It was extremely lively. It was clear that someone important was getting married.</p><p>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it that Zi Xunyi that you wanted to find?&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah? It&#x2019;s actually Zi Xunyi that&#x2019;s getting married?&#x201D; Chu Feng was incomparably shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Seems like you know nothing about that Zi Xunyi,&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er said.</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that you know a lot about her?&#x201D; Chu Feng was very surprised. Judging from Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s reaction, it was clear that she knew about Zi Xunyi.</p><p>Merely, Chu Feng was very curious. This girl was clearly not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Thus, how could she know so much?</p><p>It was one thing to know about Zhan Haichuan. After all, he was a grand character, an era&#x2019;s legend famous throughout the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, someone that everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm knew about.</p><p>However, that Li Yue&#x2019;er actually knew about Zi Xunyi too. Furthermore, it seemed like she also knew some things regarding Zi Xunyi.</p><p>&#x201C;Seems like I will have to explain the situation first before entering.&#x201D;</p><p>After Li Yue&#x2019;er finished saying those words, she began to narrate the things regarding Zi Xunyi to Chu Feng.</p><p>Zi Xunyi was not from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan. She was a human.</p><p>The reason why she was in the Demon Elimination Cave was because she managed to have a chance encounter with the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>When Zi Xunyi was young, she was saved by an expert from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan. As for that expert, it was the former Clan Chief of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan.</p><p>Seeing that Zi Xunyi had a pitiful life, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s former Clan Chief decided to bring her back into the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan. Not only did he take her in, but he also taught her martial cultivation.</p><p>Coincidentally, that Zi Xunyi was actually a genius martial cultivator. Because of that, she was highly regarded by the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s former Clan Chief.</p><p>One thing worthy of mentioning was that the son of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s former Clan Chief, that is the current Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, was Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s martial sibling.</p><p>Back then, the two of them had learned martial cultivation together. This produced a very deep relationship for the two of them. The current Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had also fallen deeply in love with the human woman.</p><p>Unfortunately, after the matter was known by the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s former Clan Chief, he utterly opposed it.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
