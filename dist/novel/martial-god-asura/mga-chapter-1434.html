<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1434 - Finally Arrived</strong></p><p>&#x201C;People of the Dongfang Imperial Clan, why have you come to our Alliance Domain?&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing how arrogant they were, Miao Renlong also replied with a loud snarl. After all, regardless of how powerful the Dongfang Imperial Clan might be, this was still their World Spiritist Alliance&#x2019;s territory.</p><p>As a peak Half Martial Emperor, Miao Renlong was extremely powerful. Naturally, his loud snarl was extremely imposing. Not only did his voice cause the earth to tremble and create countless cracks, even the golden radiance in the sky that covered the Dongfang Imperial Clan started to ripple like water from being affected by his voice.</p><p>&#x201C;Who is below?&#x201D;</p><p>The might Miao Renlong displayed had clearly caused the Dongfang Imperial Clan to face him squarely. Once again, a voice sounded from the golden radiance. Merely, this time around, it was different from before. This time around, it was the voice of a young man.</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Alliance, Miao Renlong,&#x201D; Miao Renlong replied loudly.</p><p>&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;So it&#x2019;s actually senior Miao, Miao Renlong. I am a prince of the Dongfang Imperial Clan, Dongfang Zexuan.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I have come here precisely to go to your World Spiritist Alliance,&#x201D; That young man&#x2019;s voice sounded once again. Although he was addressing Miao Renlong as a senior, there was no trace of respect in his tone at all. Instead, it was filled with arrogance.</p><p>&#x201C;So it&#x2019;s actually the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Third Prince,&#x201D; Hearing that name, Miao Renlong was startled. Not only did he know of this Dongfang Zexuan, he was also very surprised by his arrival. Thus, he asked, &#x201C;Might I know what has brought Third Prince to our World Spiritist Alliance?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Miao, I&#x2019;ll see you at the World Spiritist Alliance,&#x201D; Dongfang Zexuan&#x2019;s voice sounded once again. However, after this voice landed, that large expanse of golden light started to move once again. In an instant, it left the sky above Chu Feng and the others and disappeared into the distant horizon. As for the direction that they disappeared in, it was precisely the direction of the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>&#x201C;Bastard, who does he think himself to be? He actually dared to talk to my Grandpa Miao in such a rude manner,&#x201D; When she saw this scene, Sima Ying started to gnash her teeth in anger. Her sweetly pretty little face had turned red in anger.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, he&#x2019;s extremely rude. Regardless of what sort of origin he might have, this is, after all, the Alliance Domain,&#x201D; In fact, it was not only Sima Ying. Even Old Village Chief Ma voiced his disapproval.</p><p>Not only did that Dongfang Zexuan leave without answering Miao Renlong&#x2019;s question after discovering his identity, they had not removed the golden radiance that covered their appearances the entire time. Not only was this not placing Miao Renlong in their eyes, this was also not placing the World Spiritist Alliance in their eyes, for they refused to show even the bare minimum amount of respect.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026; Dongfang Zexuan, this is indeed his style,&#x201D; However, compared to Sima Ying and Old Village Chief Ma, Miao Renlong felt rather at ease. He was not angered by the actions of this Dongfang Zexuan.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Miao, you know this Dongfang Zexuan?&#x201D; Sima Ying asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;He is the Dongfang Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Third Prince. In terms of talent and strength, he is one of the top geniuses in the entire Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When he was twenty, he became a Half Martial Emperor. In the same year, he beheaded over a hundred Half Martial Emperors by himself. Among them, ten were rank four Half Martial Emperors that possessed heaven-defying battle power and exceptional techniques.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It would be no exaggeration to say that all of our Nine Power&#x2019;s geniuses would be unable to compare with him. He is one of the true peak geniuses of the Holy Land of Martialism, an existence who will stand at the apex of the Holy Land of Martialism in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, due to the fact that he is rather young, his name is not very well known. Therefore, not many people know about him.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, all those who do know about him also know that his name will soon spread through the entire Holy Land of Martialism,&#x201D; Miao Renlong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if he is a genius, he should know etiquette, no?&#x201D; Even though Sima Ying was also very surprised after hearing about how powerful Dongfang Zexuan was, she was still feeling angry.</p><p>&#x201C;Some geniuses will always feel that they are superior to ordinary people. The more outstanding a genius is, the more likely it is that they will not place others in their eyes. As for this Dongfang Zexuan, I have met him before. He was definitely a model representation of this sort of genius.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This is the kind of temperament that he possesses. Not only would he treat me in such a manner, it&#x2019;s likely that he treats even his seniors in the Dongfang Imperial Clan in such a manner too. Likely, there is no one that he would respect in the entire Holy Land of Martialism.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Compared to the attitude that he displayed, I am more interested in knowing exactly why he is going to our World Spiritist Alliance. I highly doubt that he has come to pay a mere visit.&#x201D; As Miao Renlong said those words, a trace of worry emerged in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Miao, in that case, could it be that he&#x2019;s coming to provoke us?&#x201D; After hearing what Miao Renlong said, Sima Ying started to worry too.</p><p>With how powerful this Dongfang Zexuan was, if he were to come and challenge them, no one in his generation will be able to contend against him. This was most definitely not something good.</p><p>&#x201C;Dongfang Zexuan needs to spread his fame. As for the best method of spreading fame, it would be by creating trouble. I think that he is most likely coming with ill intentions,&#x201D; Miao Renlong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandpa Miao, what are we to do then?&#x201D; Sima Ying started to worry even more.</p><p>&#x201C;We must adopt measures appropriate to the situation. Although our World Spiritist Alliance is inferior to the Dongfang Imperial Clan, we most definitely have not established ourselves in the Holy Land of Martialism with an underserved reputation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go, follow me and return.&#x201D; Although Miao Renlong was acting calm on the surface, Chu Feng was able to tell that he was extremely worried.</p><p>After this matter, Miao Renlong rapidly brought Sima Ying, Chu Feng and Old Village Chief Ma to the ancient Teleportation Formation. Then, with Sima Ying, he rushed to return back to the World Spiritist Alliance.</p><p>As for Old Village Chief Ma, he felt that Miao Renlong had helped him. Adding on that the Dongfang Imperial Clan had most likely come with ill intent, he decided to proceed to the World Spiritist Alliance with Miao Renlong and Sima Ying to see if he could be of help to them.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, even though he was also very worried about whether that Dongfang Zexuan would create troubles or not, with how powerful Dongfang Zexuan was, and how he had most likely come with ill intent and brought a lot of experts with him, Chu Feng determined that he would not be able to help.</p><p>However, regardless, Chu Feng would still have to go to the World Spiritist Alliance. Not to mention that Su Mei was in the World Spiritist Alliance, but merely because Sima Ying was his friend, he could not just sit and watch.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng was determined to proceed to the World Spiritist Alliance. Even if, with his strength, he would barely be able to help at all, he would still try to help however he could.</p><p>However, before that, Chu Feng had to proceed to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. After all, he had left the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest for some time now. Chu Feng was not certain whether Hong Qiang would be able to continue suppressing that Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower.</p><p>Thus, in order to prevent accidents from occurring, Chu Feng chose to rush to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest as quickly as possible. Only by suppressing the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower and obtaining the lotus seed would Chu Feng be able to set his mind at ease.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng entered the ancient Teleportation Formation and began to relentlessly rush toward the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. Finally, he returned to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest.</p><p>Currently, Chu Feng possessed a very extraordinary status in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. He was no ordinary disciple. Instead, he was one of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest&#x2019;s heads.</p><p>Thus, he could be said to be below only one person and above tens of thousands in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. He was an existence that could cover the sky with one hand. The Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest was his territory, a place where he could come and go as he pleased without anyone daring to block his path.</p><p>It was precisely because of this that everything went extremely smoothly for Chu Feng after he arrived at the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. Chu Feng returned directly to the Discarded Bamboo Forest.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve returned.&#x201D; When a familiar voice sounded, Chu Feng&#x2019;s tense heart was finally lifted.</p><p>It was Hong Qiang&#x2019;s voice. Furthermore, this voice was filled with vitality. Hong Qiang&#x2019;s state was extremely good. This meant that nothing that Chu Feng had been worrying about had happened.</p><p>At this moment, an uncontainable joy surged through Chu Feng&#x2019;s mind.</p><p>After all the twists and turns, it was finally time to subdue the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower and obtain the lotus seeds.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
