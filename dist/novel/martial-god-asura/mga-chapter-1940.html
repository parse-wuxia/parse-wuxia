<p><strong> Chapter 1940 - In So Much Pain That One Wished To Die</strong></p><p>&#x201C;What is it that you&#x2019;re wearing? Is it an armor made of Blood Devouring Insects? Is that how you all managed to charge into the Blood Devouring Killing Formation?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Were you the one who killed the YinYang Immortal? No, no, no, I doubt it was you. It should have been Xian Miaomiao instead. Truth be told, Xian Miaomiao was much more powerful than you. Even though you possess the same power as Lord Hall Master, you are inferior to even Xian Miaomiao. As such, how could you possibly compare to Lord Hall Master?&#x201D; The World Devastator Immortal landed from the sky and arrived beside Chu Feng.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng was silent. He was only staring ferociously at the World Devastator Immortal. His gaze was so frightening that it caused the World Devastator Immortal to feel very uncomfortable.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you looking at? You&#x2019;re not allowed to look,&#x201D; The World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s foot landed ruthlessly on Chu Feng&#x2019;s left arm. He ruthlessly crushed Chu Feng&#x2019;s bones with his stomp.</p><p>However, Chu Feng refused to remove his gaze from the World Devastator Immortal. Just like that, he stared at the World Devastator Immortal in an extremely fierce manner. He was planning to remember this man. As long as he didn&#x2019;t die, he would definitely make him pay for his actions and deeds today.</p><p>&#x201C;Continue to look, this is what you get for looking at me!&#x201D; The World Devastator Immortal began to trample Chu Feng&#x2019;s body nonstop with his foot. He shattered all of the bones in Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. Yet, even with that, he was unable to shift Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze away from him.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, useless trash. The current you is who you truly are,&#x201D; The World Devastator Immortal snorted coldly. Then, he floated into the air and swiftly left.</p><p>At that moment, only Chu Feng remained there. All of his bones had been shattered by the World Devastator Immortal&#x2019;s stomping. His internal organs and the surface of his body were also badly damaged.</p><p>Chu Feng truly looked like nothing more than a bloody piece of flesh. His entire body was covered in blood. His shattered bones could be seen amidst the blood and viscera.</p><p>Painful. Naturally, this would be very painful. However, the pain from his body was much inferior to the pain Chu Feng was feeling in his heart.</p><p>To see that many people die before him without being able to do anything, that sort of feeling truly gripped the heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, if you are a man, then stand back up. Do not let their scheme succeed. Do not allow yourself to be beaten down by them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is true that you are inferior to them right now. However, that&#x2019;s only because you have yet to mature. They have all trained in martial cultivation for thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years. Yet, what about you? You&#x2019;ve only trained for over a dozen years.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If they cannot suppress you even after training for so long, they would truly be humiliating themselves.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;By the same account, if you were to train for as long as they have, they will definitely not be able to suppress you,&#x201D; At this moment, Her Lady Queen&#x2019;s voice sounded. The tone of her voice was very stern. However, more than the sternness was encouragement.</p><p>&#x201C;Eggy, rest assured. I can be beaten down to the floor. However, I will definitely stand back up. The dignity that they have snatched from me, I will, sooner or later, seize it back. As for the pain and suffering that they have bestowed upon me, I will return it tenfold, a hundredfold and even a thousandfold.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng spoke, he began to unleash his spirit power. At the same time, the Vermillion Bird Resurrection Technique enveloped his entire body. With the combination of the two, Chu Feng&#x2019;s body was instantly healed.</p><p>Chu Feng stood up and looked to the surrounding area. The more he looked, the more pain he felt. However, he still insisted on looking. He needed to remember this pain. He was going to carve this pain into his bones and engrave it into his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Sooner or later, I&#x2019;ll have them know that humiliating me without killing me today was their greatest mistake,&#x201D; Killing intent was overflowing in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes. He swore that he would return the humiliation he had suffered today with interest.</p><p>Bang~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, crushed rocks suddenly moved about in the distance. Then, a red light soared into the sky.</p><p>It was Lil Red!!!</p><p>&#x201C;Great sir, great sir,&#x201D; Lil Red ran directly toward Chu Feng. Tears filled its two little eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Lil Red, how did you manage to survive?&#x201D; Chu Feng was very surprised. Lil Red was clearly on Xian Miaomiao. As Xian Miaomiao had been killed, Lil Red should have been killed alongside her.</p><p>&#x201C;She naturally would have to live,&#x201D; Right at that moment, a familiar voice sounded.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s body trembled upon hearing that voice. The reason for that was because that was Xian Miaomiao&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng hurriedly turned his head around. It was only then that he discovered that Xian Miaomiao was actually standing not far away from him. She was walking toward him.</p><p>At this moment, other than a change in dress, Xian Miaomiao&#x2019;s appearance was exactly the same as before. She was indeed alive and not dead.</p><p>&#x201C;Miaomiao, you&#x2019;re alive? How could this be?&#x201D; Chu Feng ran over to Xian Miaomiao excitedly. Astonishment filled his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re very surprised, right? I&#x2019;m not that easily killed. Let me tell you a secret. I possess a total of nine lives,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said. [1. Cats have nine lives lol. Her name is Meowmeow.]</p><p>&#x201C;Nine lives?&#x201D; Chu Feng was very confused.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. It&#x2019;s this. You can have a look if you don&#x2019;t believe me,&#x201D; As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she removed the necklace on her neck and opened the pendant that was on it.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Upon seeing the pearl in the pendant, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes immediately started to shine with astonishment.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow! Chu Feng, that girl actually possesses such a treasure. That is most definitely the most powerful treasure this Queen has seen so far.&#x201D; Even Her Lady Queen was incomparably shocked.</p><p>It was a treasure, most definitely a treasure. One could tell that it was a treasure just by looking at it.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing, no? My lives are not with me. Instead, they&#x2019;re all in that pearl. That&#x2019;s why, even if my body and soul are destroyed, I will still not die, because this pearl will revive me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not only that, the pearl was also able to teleport me to another location during the moment of my life and death crisis.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This would cause others to think that I had been shattered to bits from their attack. However, I would have actually escaped with all my treasures. It is precisely because of that that Lil Red is also still alive,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said with a beaming smile.</p><p>Chu Feng felt extremely pained in his heart as he looked to Xian Miaomiao acting in such a manner. This girl before him had just suffered the pain of losing her clansmen, her relatives. She was feeling even more unbearable pain than him.</p><p>Yet, she was actually able to smile in this sort of situation. Chu Feng could tell that she was doing so deliberately because she was afraid that she would burden him. That was why she was forcing herself to smile and pretending that she was happy.</p><p>&#x201C;But, you have still lost a life, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to the pearl and saw that there were only seven rays of light within it. As such, he knew that Xian Miaomiao now only had seven lives remaining. If she really did possess nine lives, she had already lost two lives now.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s alright. Even if I have lost a life, I will still be able to die seven more times. Merely that is not something that others can compare with,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said complacently.</p><p>&#x201C;Yayaya, beauty, in that case, you used one of your lives to save great sir earlier?&#x201D; Lil Red asked in an extremely shocked manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Lil Red, shut up!&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao immediately shouted at Lil Red.</p><p>&#x201C;Lil Red, what did you say?&#x201D; Chu Feng hurriedly asked. He was able to determine that something was amiss.</p><p>&#x201C;Great sir, when you were unconscious and seriously injured, this beauty used that pearl to save you. I saw with my own eyes that a strand of light left the pearl and entered your body. That is how you managed to recover from your injuries.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If the strands of light represent the beauty&#x2019;s lives, then she used one of her lives to save you,&#x201D; Lil Red ignored Xian Miaomiao and told Chu Feng what had happened.</p><p>&#x201C;Miaomiao, you actually-!!!&#x201D; After hearing this, Chu Feng felt as if his entire body was numb. He didn&#x2019;t know what to say to her.</p><p>Xian Miaomiao had actually used one of her lives in order to save him from the Evil God Sword&#x2019;s backlash.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
