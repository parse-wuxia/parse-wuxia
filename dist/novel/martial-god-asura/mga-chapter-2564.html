<p><strong>Chapter 2564 - Furious Roar</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Xunyi, I&#x2019;m&#x2026; sorry. This disappointing body of mine has defiled your face.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026; I know that you&#x2026; are most fond of being clean. But, Xunyi, p-please don&#x2019;t blame me for it. I t-truly did not intend to do that,&#x201D; The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief spoke in a very apologetic manner. His tone was very weak, and it took him a lot of effort to speak.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t say anymore. Quickly, take this,&#x201D; Zi Xunyi wanted to give the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief the medicinal pellet in her hand.</p><p>However, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief waved his hand. With great difficulty, he said, &#x201C;I am most aware of my own body. Even if a god were to descend upon the mortal world, he would still not be able to save me.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Xunyi, I want to tell you this. I am truly glad to be able to see your youthful appearance again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A-alth-although&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although I know that this youthful appearance of yours is not for me.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief&#x2019;s head leaned to the side. He completely collapsed in Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s bosom.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhenping!!!&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;<br>At that moment, Zi Xunyi let out a scream so painful that she felt like dying.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhenping, wake up, I am willing to marry you, wake up. As long as you wake up, I will return to the Demon Elimination Cave with you and become your wife.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will never leave the Demon Elimination Cave again. I will never leave you again.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I will spend the rest of my life together with you. Since you are fond of my current appearance, I will always keep my current appearance, okay?&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Just wake up. Please, wake up. As long as you wake up, I will agree to everything. This time, I will definitely keep my word.&#x201D;</p><p>Tears filled Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s face. She was sincere in each and every word she spoke. Those were what she felt from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was no longer able to hear those words. The reason for that was because he had died, he was completely dead.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Paa<del>~&#x201D;
&#x3000;
&#x201C;Paa</del>~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a series of claps was suddenly heard.</p><p>It was the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>It turned out that the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the five Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted elders were actually all standing there.</p><p>They were watching what had happened earlier as if they were enjoying a show.</p><p>Merely, there was not the slightest trace of sympathy or pity on their faces. Instead, they all had smiles of enjoyment on their faces.</p><p>&#x201C;What an unfortunately affectionate couple. However, you don&#x2019;t have to grieve too much either. After all, you will soon meet him again in the netherworld.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>After saying those words, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief raised his Ancestral Armament and unleashed a slash toward Zi Xunyi.</p><p>Zi Xunyi was able to dodge that slash. However, she did not try to dodge the slash. It seemed like she was not planning to continue living.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, a ferocious slash was sent out from deep within the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p><p>That slash was very powerful. With an unbelievable speed, it flew over and easily slashed apart the slash sent forth by the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;Children Kong and Zhou, do you all still recognize your daddy I?&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, a roar filled with anger exploded in throughout the region.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;That is?&#x201D;</p><p>Looking toward the direction of the voice, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortal immediately revealed an enormous change in expression.</p><p>The reason for that was because the person who had shouted those words was none other than Ying Mingchao. Arriving together with him was Chu Feng.</p><p>However, the Ying Mingchao that they knew had already died over a thousand years ago. As such, how could he be there at that moment?</p><p>&#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t die?&#x201D; The Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked in a slightly panicky manner.</p><p>It was not only the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief who started to feel slightly panicky; even the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the five Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders started to feel slightly panicky.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>Although they were all rank two True Immortals, Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s battle power was not something that Zi Xunyi and the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief could compare to.</p><p>Although they had managed to defeat Ying Mingchao over a thousand years ago, they had made numerous preparations for the sake of that battle. Only they themselves knew how much they invested back then.</p><p>At the moment they had already exhausted themselves quite a bit fighting Zi Xunyi and the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>If they were to fight Ying Mingchao, even they had no certainty as to whether or not they would be able to win the battle.</p><p>Although Ying Mingchao was filled with fury and overflowing with murderous desire, he did not immediately attack the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals after seeing Zi Xunyi.</p><p>Instead, his body moved. Bringing Chu Feng with him, he arrived beside Zi Xunyi.</p><p>Seeing Zi Xunyi who was riddled with wounds, Ying Mingchao started to gnash his teeth furiously. He felt extremely pained; pained for that woman before him.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, help me heal her injuries,&#x201D; Ying Mingchao suddenly said to Chu Feng.</p><p>After saying those words, Ying Mingchao flipped his wrist, and a golden-bright and dazzling halberd appeared in his hand.</p><p>Once the golden halberd appeared, dragon roars started to sound.<br>&#x3000;<br>It turned out there was actually a golden dragon coiling around the golden halberd. That golden dragon was so very vivid and lifelike. It was as if it were an actual dragon that was radiating its oppressive might all over.</p><p>This Ancestral Armament was of even higher quality than Chu Feng&#x2019;s Stormwind Edge.</p><p>&#x201C;Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd, he is indeed Ying Mingchao. He is actually still alive.&#x201D;</p><p>After sensing the oppressive might coming from Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s Ancestral Armament, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals felt with even greater certainty that the man before them was truly Ying Mingchao.</p><p>While it might be possible for one to disguise oneself as another, it would be impossible for one to disguise an Ancestral Armament. After sensing its oppressive might, they were certain that the man before them was Ying Mingchao.</p><p>The reason for that was because the Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd originated from the Ancient Era. There was only one such weapon in the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Back then, countless people fought over it in that Ancient Era&#x2019;s remnant. In the end, Ying Mingchao was the one who managed to obtain it.</p><p>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shouted, &#x201C;Set up the formation!&#x201D; Then, they once again set up their bloodline slaughtering formation that they used against Zi Xunyi earlier.<br>&#x3000;<br>Although they were extremely afraid of Ying Mingchao, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals had no other options. They had no choice but to fight Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Unfortunately, even though they were going all-out to fight Ying Mingchao, they were incapable of obtaining their desired result.</p><p>Although the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals had managed to seriously injure Zi Xunyi and kill the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief using that bloodline formation of theirs, they found it very strenuous when faced with Ying Mingchao.<br>&#x3000;<br>After merely fighting him for a short moment, they entered a disadvantaged position.</p><p>Ying Mingchao was truly ferocious. It was as if he was born to battle. He was incomparably fierce in battle.</p><p>&#x201C;Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s battle power is extremely strong. Moreover, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s True Immortals have already exhausted quite a bit of their stamina and power. It would seem that he is able to take care of them by himself.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;<br>After observing the battle for a while, Her Lady Queen felt relieved.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Evil God Sword was curbed by that so-called Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. Thus, Chu Feng&#x2019;s strongest trump card was simply ineffective.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>Furthermore, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had already died, and Zi Xunyi was seriously injured. At that moment, the only person capable of fighting against the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clan was Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Whether or not they would be able to leave alive would all be dependent on Ying Mingchao.</p><p>&#x201C;Heeahh!!!&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>Ying Mingchao was burning with rage. He roared as he fought on. At that moment, he was like a fierce tiger fighting a group of wolves; he was completely unparalleled.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Trash! What sort of ability is it to bully a woman?! Where are your capabilities?! Show them to me!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you have any skills, bring them on at your daddy I!&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;<br>Ying Mingchao was truly furious. The reason why he was so furious was not because he was plotted against by the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clan over a thousand years ago.</p><p>Rather, it was because Zi Xunyi was seriously injured by them. Zi Xunyi was the woman that he loved dearly. Furthermore, Ying Mingchao knew very well that if he were to have shown up any later, Zi Xunyi would have been a corpse.</p><p>Faced with people who wanted to kill his beloved, as a man, Ying Mingchao would naturally not be able to tolerate it.</p><p>He had already made preparations to unleash a massacre.</p><p>&#x201C;Ying Mingchao, you dare call us trash? Even after you&#x2019;ve disappeared for a thousand years, you&#x2019;re still only a rank two True Immortal.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The outcome of the battle today is still undetermined.&#x201D;</p><p>Faced with Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s insults, the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief spoke back to mock Ying Mingchao.</p><p>&#x201C;Puuu~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd hacked down and sent forth a blade ray. The speed of that blade ray was so fast that the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was simply unable to dodge it. His right arm was actually sliced off by Ying Mingchao&#x2019;s slash.</p><p>The Ancestral Armament that he held in his right arm also fell to the ground.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
