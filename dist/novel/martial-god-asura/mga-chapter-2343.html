<p><strong> Chapter 2343 - Stormwind Edge</strong></p><p>Before Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong could answer Grandmaster Prophet&#x2019;s question, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother declared with a strange tone, &#x201C;Is there even a need to ask? It&#x2019;s naturally because someone was secretly protecting them. Else, how could the three of them, with their strength, possibly reach this place?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to hide yourself anymore. Since you&#x2019;ve come, you must have come for Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s treasures. Why not show yourself?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid that we&#x2019;ll have to disappoint you. The three of us do not possess the protection of any senior,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha. What a joke!&#x201D; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother laughed out loud.</p><p>&#x201C;Why do you find it funny?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Why? Are you saying that I cannot laugh at your boasting?&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors declared.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; At that moment, Chu Feng also laughed.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you laughing about?&#x201D; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother asked with a stern voice.</p><p>&#x201C;I am laughing at you. It is best that you don&#x2019;t mock me this quickly. You should instead focus on your spirit formation, since it will soon be destroyed,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say? You&#x2019;re saying that my spirit formation will be destroyed? Nonsense!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although my spirit formation is an unsealing formation, it remains something created by Grandmaster Kai Hong. Its defense is equally invulnerable!&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said confidently.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, a ray of light shot out from the grand defensive formation. That ray of light flickered with golden brightness. Like an unstoppable sharp sword capable of sweeping everything before it, it shattered the unsealing formation the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother had set up.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be?!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that scene, the crowd present were all astonished.</p><p>Although that grand defensive formation was very powerful, it should only possess defensive functions. However, just then, that grand defensive formation had let out a ray of light by itself and shattered the unsealing formation set up by the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors. This meant that the grand defensive formation also possessed an extremely powerful offensive nature.</p><p>This being said, what the crowd was the most confused by was why that grand defensive formation would attack and destroy the unsealing formation set up by the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother, as well as how Chu Feng managed to determine that it would do so.</p><p>Confused, someone turned to ask Chu Feng, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, could it be that you&#x2019;d managed to discover that that grand defensive formation would attack and destroy the unsealing formation set up by World Spiritist Saintess?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, truth be told, this junior has trained in a special sort of observation technique. Although that defensive formation is powerful, its various mysteries have all been seen through by this junior&#x2019;s eyes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, not only am I able to determine what that grand defensive formation will do, I am also able to undo that grand defensive formation and open the coffin,&#x201D; Chu Feng said confidently.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, is what you said the truth?&#x201D; Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd&#x2019;s eyes immediately started to shine. It was as if they had seen hope in desperation.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Chu Feng had a confident smile on his face the entire time.</p><p>Chu Feng did not lie, nor was he boasting.</p><p>The reason why he was so certain that the spirit formation the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors set up was not going to work was precisely because he had managed to see through that grand defensive formation.</p><p>Since Chu Feng had already managed to see through the grand defensive formation, he would naturally also know about how to undo that grand defensive formation.</p><p>However, there was one thing that Chu Feng remained extremely puzzled by.</p><p>That was that he had not utilized his Heaven&#x2019;s Eyes to see through the grand defensive formation. Rather, he had managed to see through it with his naked eye.</p><p>However, neither Zhao Hong nor Wang Qiang were able to see what Chu Feng saw.</p><p>In other words, although they were all observing the grand defensive formation normally, ordinary people would find it to be invulnerable, whereas Chu Feng would find it to be full of mistakes.</p><p>It was as if that grand defensive formation was deliberately showing its weaknesses to only Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;What crazy and unfounded ravings! Brat, you are but a mere Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, merely someone who has just stepped foot past the entrance of Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Yet, you dare to boast so shamelessly?&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors mocked.</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, all the things that little friend Chu Feng has said since his arrival have come true.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He was correct when he said that you would not be able to undo that grand defensive formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;He was also correct when he said that the unsealing formation you&#x2019;d set up would be destroyed.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This means that little friend Chu Feng possesses true abilities, that he is unlike you, who only knows how to boast,&#x201D; That Elder Duan Chunchang mocked the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. That&#x2019;s right.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x2026;...</p><p>Many of the people present seized the opportunity to make cutting remarks at the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother.</p><p>&#x201C;You all! Good! Very good!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You all have actually fallen so much from grace that you&#x2019;ve decided to hand the great responsibility of undoing the grand defensive formation to a brat.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Very well, this Saintess will satisfy you all. I will let you all find out how ignorant and foolish your decision is,&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was so furious that her voice started to tremble. Her tone was filled with complaint.</p><p>&#x201C;I will naturally undo this grand defensive formation. However, World Spiritist Saintess, please honor your previous promise first,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Right, r-right, right. Y-y-you are, n-no matter what, a senior. Y-you cannot go back o-on your word,&#x201D; Wang Qiang laughed.</p><p>Others like Duan Chunchang also joined Wang Qiang and began to urge the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors to apologize to Chu Feng.</p><p>In this sort of situation, even though the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was very unwilling, she had no other choice but to do so. After all, there were so many people present who had borne witness to her bet. Even if she wanted to refuse to acknowledge it after the fact, she could not do so.</p><p>At that moment, she was filled with regret. She regretted being overly confident. She had not expected that she would actually lose to Chu Feng.</p><p>However, although she was very unwilling, she still had to apologize to him.</p><p>Thus, with an ugly expression on her face, she looked to Chu Feng and said, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I lost my demeanor and attacked you rashly earlier. I hope that you will&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;H-how could t-this possibly do. W-wasn&#x2019;t it a-agreed upon th-that you&#x2019;d apologize while kneeling?&#x201D; However, before the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors could finish, Wang Qiang sighed and interrupted her.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say? You dare demand that I kneel?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was extremely furious. Her anger was like that of an erupting volcano. Everyone present was able to sense her anger.</p><p>It was only because there were many experts present. Else, the crowd believed that the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors would definitely kill Wang Qiang on the spot.</p><p>That said, Wang Qiang was not a person who feared getting into trouble. Thus, he remained completely unmoved by the threats from the Four World Spiritist Emperor&#x2019;s mother. Instead, with a very unreconciled manner, he said, &#x201C;Pah! It w-was you w-who said you would earlier. A-are you p-planning to consider y-your words as farts a-and forget about t-them j-j-just like that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did I really say such a thing?&#x201D; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors looked to the crowd. She acted as if she had truly forgotten about it.</p><p>&#x201C;Indeed, such a thing did happen,&#x201D; The crowd nodded their heads.</p><p>At this moment, the expression of the Four World Spiritist Emperor&#x2019;s mother turned purple and then blue. It was as marvelous as could be.</p><p>While she was able to apologize, to have her kneel towards a person of the younger generation, and Chu Feng on top of that, before all these people was something that she found truly impossible to do.</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, it was you who said that. Thus, you should be keep your promise and act accordingly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, taking your status into considering, it is indeed somewhat inappropriate for you to kneel to Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Grandmaster Prophet suggested, &#x201C;How about this, would you be willing to give Chu Feng some compensation to make up for this matter?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Compensation? What sort of compensation?&#x201D; Zhao Hong asked in a somewhat displeased manner. She possessed a very frank temperament. Even though the person who had spoken was Grandmaster Prophet, who possessed a very high status, she would still give him no face if she felt that he was discriminating in favor of the World Spiritist Saintess.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, as you are little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s friend, what sort of compensation do you think would be suitable?&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet asked with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;An Ancestral Armament. Else, we can forget about it,&#x201D; Zhao Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;Impudent!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was once again overflowing with fury.</p><p>&#x201C;You can either kneel or hand over an Ancestral Armament. You decide what you want to do,&#x201D; Zhao Hong&#x2019;s attitude was very ill-intended.</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, I&#x2019;ve heard that you just managed to purchase an Ancestral Armament not too long ago. Wasn&#x2019;t it the Stormwind Edge?&#x201D; Elder Duan Chunchang of the Immortal Sword School said.</p><p>&#x201C;Stormwind Edge? Could it be that Ancestral Armament that is rumored to be from the Ancient Era?&#x201D; At that moment, many of the people present all revealed surprised gazes.</p><p>Although Ancestral Armaments were rare in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, there were still quite a few of them. However, not many among them were famous. As for that Stormwind Edge, it was a very famous Ancestral Armament.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;ve heard that World Spiritist Saintess paid an enormous amount to obtain that Stormwind Edge. After all, the Stormwind Edge could be considered a legendary Ancestral Armament,&#x201D; Elder Duan Chunchang said with a smile.</p><p>After this, the crowd began to discuss the Stormwind Edge more intensely.</p><p>At that moment, the expression of the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother grew even uglier. The reason for that was because she knew very well how precious the Stormwind Edge was. She absolutely wouldn&#x2019;t hand it over to Chu Feng.</p><p>Thus, after a hard mental conflict, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; mother finally came to a decision. She said loudly, &#x201C;Very well. Chu Feng, as compensation, I am able to hand you an Ancestral Armament. However, the Stormwind Edge is out of the question.&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, the crowd present were all startled.</p><p>Agreed? She actually agreed?</p><p>Ancestral Armament, one must know that it was an Ancestral Armament. Although the World Spiritist Saintess was unwilling to hand the Stormwind Edge to Chu Feng, ordinary Ancestral Armaments were all considerably valuable items.</p><p>A mere bet spoken orally actually allowed Chu Feng to win an Ancestral Armament. This truly caused the crowd to feel endless envy.</p><p>However, at the moment when the crowd all felt that the matter would be settled with the World Spiritist Saintess giving Chu Feng an Ancestral Armament, Chu Feng smiled lightly and said, &#x201C;I only want the Stormwind Edge.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
