<p><strong> Chapter 2357 - Who Dares Touch Him?</strong></p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll set aside what happened in the remnants. After all, no matter how you look at it, you all were unreasonable.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As such, I&#x2019;ll switch the subject to what just happened.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All the seniors present here are renowned individuals. All of you are Martial Ancestors, and many among you are also peak Martial Ancestors. &#x201C;</p><p>&#x201C;I do not have to say how powerful you all are. After all, your overwhelming strengths are publicly known throughout the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, I dare ask, is there anyone among you that is capable of defeating that Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s Protector?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did any of you stand forth to face that Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s Protector during the time when he was acting endlessly arrogant?&#x201D; Chu Feng continued.</p><p>At that moment, it was not only those world spiritists; the others also began to lower their heads.</p><p>Indeed, none of them had dared to stand out to face that West Palace Protector.</p><p>&#x201C;Earlier, if it wasn&#x2019;t for me activating my crystal giant, I fear that all the seniors present would have been killed by that Infant Soul Sect&#x2019;s Protector.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It is one thing for all you seniors here to not say a word of thanks to me, but you actually wanted to demand for us to share a portion of what we obtained in the remnants with you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I understand things correctly, everyone here, the renowned and powerful seniors, are planning to disregard righteousness and kick your benefactor in the teeth for the sake of riches, right?&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to the crowd with a mocking gaze.</p><p>At that moment, not only was the crowd lowering their heads, their complexions had also turned even redder.</p><p>The reason for that was because what Chu Feng said was the truth. If it wasn&#x2019;t for his crystal giant, it would have been impossible for them to leave the remnants alive.</p><p>Reasonably, they should not demand the treasures that Chu Feng obtained in the remnants.</p><p>Actually, even if Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t mention it, they, more or less, already felt ashamed too.</p><p>Each and every word that Chu Feng said in his speech were like swords. Each and every one of his words drew blood. As such, they would naturally become endlessly ashamed.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, did you all notice one thing?&#x201D; Right at that moment, the World Spiritist Saintess suddenly spoke. Compared to the others, she did not have the slightest trace of an ashamed expression on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;What thing?&#x201D; The crowd asked in unison. They all wanted to break free from their awkward situation. The words spoken by the World Spiritist Saintess allowed them to shift the topic of conversation around.</p><p>&#x201C;The crystal giant Chu Feng unleashed earlier greatly resembled the four from before. If my guess is correct, that True Immortal-level crystal giant was formed through the fusion of the four peak Martial Ancestor-level crystal giants,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Saintess said with a strange smile.</p><p>&#x201C;And what about it?&#x201D; A Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist asked in a disapproving manner.</p><p>&#x201C;This means that Chu Feng and his friends currently do not possess any crystal giants.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we want to do anything to them, they will not be able to resist in the slightest. Thus, there is simply no need to bother with superfluous words with them. Just deal with them directly,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Saintess turned her gloomy and cold gaze to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;You dare?!!!&#x201D; Zhao Hong shouted furiously.</p><p>&#x201C;Why wouldn&#x2019;t I? Are you implying that we would be scared of three children?&#x201D; The World Spiritist Saintess said with a cold and sinister smile.</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, if it wasn&#x2019;t for little friend Chu Feng earlier, we would all have been killed. You, what is this that you&#x2019;re planning to do here?&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet said. His tone seemed to be trying to reason with the crowd.</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, if you plan to bring harm upon little friend Chu Feng, I, Duan Chunchang, will be the first to refuse,&#x201D; As Elder Duan Chunchang spoke those words, he unleashed his peak Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might. He had revealed his sincerity to protect Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;World Spiritist Saintess, if you are to do something like that, you will truly be kicking your benefactor in the teeth,&#x201D; Following that, many other experts expressed their disapproval of the World Spiritist Saintess&#x2019;s proposal.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, I believe there is no need for me to mention to you what sort of character Grandmaster Kai Hong is.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The remnants left behind by Grandmaster Kai Hong are one of our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&#x2019;s most precious riches.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that you&#x2019;re all truly willing to hand all the treasures Grandmaster Kai Hong left behind to three mere brats?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Not mentioning whether or not these three brats will be able to properly utilize the treasures left behind by Grandmaster Kai Hong, the three of them simply do not possess the strength to safeguard Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s treasures.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rather than having the treasures snatched from them later on by the Infant Soul Sect, it&#x2019;s better that we help them keep those treasures safe today,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Saintess said.</p><p>Once the World Spiritist Saintess said those words, the expressions of the crowd all changed. Not mentioning those that were against Chu Feng earlier, even those that had spoken to support Chu Feng revealed complicated expressions.</p><p>While they might not wish to bring harm upon Chu Feng because they felt ashamed&#x2026; they also did not wish to have Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong hog all of Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s treasures.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing. To actually be able to provide an excuse for oneself to snatch another&#x2019;s treasure, I truly must admire how thick-skinned you are,&#x201D; Chu Feng mocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, although you possess conflict with the World Spiritist Saintess, what she said is not without reason.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The three of you are still very young, and your strengths are also insufficient. It is indeed not safe for Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s treasures to be left with you all.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How about this: we will help you keep them safe for the time being. When you all obtain sufficient strength in the future, we will return the treasures to you,&#x201D; That Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s peak Martial Ancestor spoke again.</p><p>&#x201C;Bull fucking shit! What difference is there between you all and those from the Infant Soul Sect?!&#x201D; Zhao Hong cursed furiously. Her delicate and pretty face had turned deep red from anger.</p><p>&#x201C;T-the w-way I see it, y-you all a-are even more d-despicable than the I-Infant Soul Sect.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A-after all, the p-people from the Infant Soul Sect a-are openly s-shameless and savage. W-whereas you are just a bunch of hypocrites who p-pretend to be r-righteous, a b-bunch that would o-only dare to bully the w-weak and a-are afraid of the strong. You a-all a-are truly despicable,&#x201D; Wang Qiang mocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Three little friends, how could you all say that sort of thing?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We are truly doing this for your sake. Perhaps you might not be able to understand our kind intentions now, but you will definitely understand in the future,&#x201D; That Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s peak Martial Ancestor said.</p><p>As he spoke, he unleashed his peak Martial Ancestor&#x2019;s oppressive might and sealed off the path of retreat for Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>&#x201C;Grandmaster Prophet, Senior Duan Chunchang, do the two of you also plan to wallow in the mire with them?&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to Grandmaster Prophet and that Elder Duan Chunchang.</p><p>&#x201C;Eh&#x2026;&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet revealed a difficult expression. In the end, he did not say anything.</p><p>As for Duan Chunchang, he said with an embarrassed tone, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you all are able to keep the inheritance. As for the treasures, we&#x2019;re not asking for you to hand over all of them. You merely need to hand over a portion of them. As long as you are willing to hand over some, I dare to guarantee that no one will will dare to harm you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If I am to tell you all that we only obtained Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s inheritance, and that there is simply no treasure, will you believe me?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, in that case, we could only inconvenience you by having you hand over the Cosmos Sack on your waist for us to inspect,&#x201D; That Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s expert rushed to speak.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand now,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he took out the Evil God Sword from his Cosmos Sack and held it in his hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, what are you doing? Don&#x2019;t tell me this is the treasure that you obtained from Grandmaster Kai Hong&#x2019;s remnants,&#x201D; The World Spiritist Saintess mocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng chuckled. Then, he said, &#x201C;You wish to search the three of us? It will depend on whether or not you have the ability to do so first. However, I will warn you beforehand. It is still not too late to pull back right now. If you truly plan to use force, you shall have to bear the consequences of your actions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, we are very thankful for you saving us earlier.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, we are not three-year-old children. Don&#x2019;t you think this is very dull for you to try to frighten us like this?&#x201D; As that Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s expert spoke, he looked to the others present and said, &#x201C;Everyone, little friend Chu Feng has declared a threat. Are you all scared?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hahahaha&#x2026;&#x201D; The crowd did not answer, but instead burst into ridiculing laughter. That served as the best response.</p><p>At that moment, the person feeling the most complacent was none other than the World Spiritist Saintess.</p><p>The way she saw it, with how things had stirred up, Chu Feng could forget about leaving safely. Even if he wasn&#x2019;t killed, he would likely be taught a lesson by the crowd and become seriously injured.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, it seems that you are unable to scare us. Then&#x2026; please excuse my offense,&#x201D; That Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s expert narrowed his eyes. Then, his peak Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might swept forth toward Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p><p>He did not unleash any killing intent. However, he felt that his oppressive might would be sufficient to have Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong suffer a crushing defeat and seriously injure them. He was feeling resentment towards how Chu Feng had spoken to contradict him earlier. Thus, he was planning to use this opportunity to discipline the three of them.</p><p>&#x201C;I shall see who dares to touch him today!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, right at that moment, a voice filled with imposing might exploded in the sky.</p><p>At the same time, an overwhelming aura descended from the sky and covered the crowd. That aura was simply too powerful. Even though there were many peak Martial Ancestors among the crowd, they were unable to withstand that aura.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
