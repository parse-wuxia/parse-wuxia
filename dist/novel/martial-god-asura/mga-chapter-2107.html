<p><strong> Chapter 2107 - Turning The Situation Around</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Are you not worried for little friend Chu Feng?&#x201D; The Heaven Reaching Immortal asked the Elf King.</p><p>&#x201C;Heaven Reaching Immortal, this should be the first time that you have seen little friend Chu Feng fighting someone, right?&#x201D; The Elf King asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn,&#x201D; The Heaven Reaching Immortal nodded his head.</p><p>&#x201C;Then, you should continue to watch it. You will come to understand soon,&#x201D; The Elf King said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;What do you mean by that?&#x201D; The Heaven Reaching Immortal asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I have fought against the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master many times, and seen little friend Chu Feng battle others several times too.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I have quite an understanding of the two of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although their strength is on par with one another, I believe that little friend Chu Feng is superior,&#x201D; The Elf King said.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Hearing those words, although the Heaven Reaching Immortal was very confused, he still turned his gaze toward the battle between Chu Feng and the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Another ear-piercing roar was heard. The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had unleashed another Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. That Earthen Taboo Martial Skill turned the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master into a gigantic eagle several thousands of meters tall.</p><p>At that moment, that ferocious giant eagle brandished its sharp talons as it pounced at Chu Feng. It was planning to rip Chu Feng to pieces.</p><p>However, Chu Feng revealed no fear of the incoming giant eagle. Instead, a sharpness flashed through his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Reckless fool, I&#x2019;ll rip you to pieces now,&#x201D; The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master was infuriated by Chu Feng&#x2019;s gaze. Thus, he unleashed all of his martial power to increase the strength of his attack.</p><p>In merely the blink of an eye, the Earthen Taboo Martial Skill unleashed by the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master reached a distance less than a hundred meters away from Chu Feng. The powerful might it emitted shattered even the space surrounding Chu Feng.</p><p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes grew sharper. Then, he flipped his palm.</p><p>&#x201C;Clank~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A ray of cold light immediately appeared. It was a slash. Like a silvery crescent, that slash appeared out of thin air and rapidly increased in size as it collided with the enormous eagle the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had turned into.</p><p>&#x201C;Crap!&#x201D;</p><p>The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master was greatly surprised by the silver slash that had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The reason for that was because that slash appeared less than ten meters from him, and possessed an extremely fast speed. In that sort of situation, he was unable to dodge the slash.</p><p>&#x201C;Rumble~~~&#x201D;</p><p>A loud rumble was heard. Surging energy ripples immediately covered the entire sky.</p><p>However, right after the energy ripples began to spread, a burst of violent wind immediately swept forth and forcibly blew the energy ripples away.</p><p>The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master appeared again. Merely, when his appearance was revealed, the crowd, other than the Elf King, all revealed expressions of disbelief.</p><p>For some unknown reason, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master that was fighting Chu Feng at a very close range had distanced himself far away from Chu Feng.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was still standing in his original location. It was only the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master whose location had changed. In other words, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master had been forced far back.</p><p>To the crowd&#x2019;s surprise, a bloody wound had appeared on the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master, who had clearly been suppressing Chu Feng the entire time earlier.</p><p>No, it was not only the bloody wound, his left arm had also disappeared. It had been sliced off by Chu Feng&#x2019;s slash earlier.</p><p>&#x201C;Despicable bastard, you actually used your Imperial Armament!&#x201D;</p><p>With merely a thought, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master reformed his lost left arm. However, his gaze was fixed onto Chu Feng&#x2019;s Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader the entire time. His eyes were filled with fury.</p><p>He had realized that Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack earlier was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. However, how could he possibly be injured by ordinary Earthen Taboo Martial Skills?</p><p>Chu Feng was able to break through his Earthen Taboo Martial Skill and successfully injure him precisely because he had used his Imperial Armament, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader.</p><p>&#x201C;Who was it that decided that we could not use Imperial Armaments in this battle?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Imperial Armaments are weapons. They are an indispensable assistance to martial cultivators. There is nothing wrong with me using my Imperial Armament.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for why you&#x2019;re injured, you can only blame it on yourself for being too arrogant and conceited. It was you who felt that you could kill me without using your Imperial Armaments.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t forget, you were holding your Imperial Armaments earlier. It was you who put them away,&#x201D; Chu Feng mocked.</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master grew even more furious.</p><p>What Chu Feng said was correct. He had originally been holding his Imperial Armaments. It was because he looked down upon Chu Feng that he decided to put his Imperial Armaments away. However, never had he expected that Chu Feng would insult him with that.</p><p>&#x201C;I understand.&#x201D;</p><p>However, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master wasn&#x2019;t a fool. Although he was furious, he realized that he had been able to obtain superiority over Chu Feng earlier not because he possessed absolute strength. Instead, it seemed that Chu Feng had deliberately egged him on.</p><p>Chu Feng had deliberately made him feel that he was stronger than him so that he would be overly confident.</p><p>Chu Feng had grasped the opportunity of him being overly confident to mount a surprise attack against him. That was how he came to be injured.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I have not wrongly accused you. You are truly despicable!!!&#x201D; After realizing what had happened, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master became even more furious.</p><p>He was someone that never did anything that he possessed no certainty in. Regardless of what sort of opponent he faced, he would always plan strategies beforehand so that he could seize the certainty of victory.</p><p>However, today, he had fallen for Chu Feng&#x2019;s scheme, someone that he had looked down upon the entire time. Naturally, he would feel extremely furious.</p><p>&#x201C;Despicable? Is someone like you worthy of calling me despicable?&#x201D; Chu Feng coldly laughed, &#x201C;I, Chu Feng, am someone who will never scheme against those that are good and honest.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, against despicable bastards like you who have done all sorts of evil, I, Chu Feng, am someone who will use all kinds of schemes. That is what you call &#x201C;giving someone a taste of their own medicine.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master shouted, &#x201C;Shut your mouth!!!&#x201D; Then, he flipped his hands, and his two Imperial Armaments appeared in his hands.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, so you&#x2019;re finally willing to use your Imperial Armaments? But&#x2026; they will not help you,&#x201D; Chu Feng mocked.</p><p>&#x201C;Bullshit!!!&#x201D; The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master shouted. Following that, he brandished the Imperial Armaments in his hands. Immediately, martial power began to gather as he unleashed a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.</p><p>The Heaven Taboo Martial Skill turned into many blade rays that shot forth to slice at Chu Feng. Like a massive army sent forth to behead a person, they swept across the void and toward Chu Feng.</p><p>The Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master was planning to get revenge by giving Chu Feng a taste of his own medicine. Chu Feng had injured him with a slash. As such, he planned to kill Chu Feng with his own slash.</p><p>&#x201C;Heaven Taboo: Heaven Devouring Wind.&#x201D;</p><p>With the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader in hand, Chu Feng hacked down directly in front of him. Immediately, a violent wind was sent forth from the Imperial Armament.</p><p>As the violent wind spun, space itself started to twist. Like flowing water, the distorted space began to pour into the violent wind.</p><p>Under that situation, the violent wind grew larger and larger. Soon, it covered all of heaven and earth. It truly looked as if the sky had been devoured by the wind.</p><p>When the slashes sent forth by the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master arrived, they too were devoured by that violent wind.</p><p>It was as if a myriad of meteors were falling from the sky, only to land in the deep, bottomless sea.</p><p>&#x201C;Go.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Roar~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Then, Chu Feng pointed at the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master, and that violent wind began to move. It turned into an enormous wind dragon that pierced through the sky as it moved to suppress the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master with overwhelming might.</p><p>Chu Feng had suppressed the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master&#x2019;s Heaven Taboo Martial Skill with his own Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.</p><p>&#x201C;What a profound martial skill,&#x201D; At that moment, the Elf King and the others all exclaimed in admiration repeatedly. They were all stunned by the Heaven Taboo Martial Skill Chu Feng had unleashed.</p><p>&#x201C;That is Qing Xuantian&#x2019;s martial skill. I saw him use it before.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, that martial skill is not that profound. It is merely that when little friend Chu Feng used it, it is even more powerful,&#x201D; The Heaven Reaching Immortal explained. Then, he looked to the Elf King and said, &#x201C;What you said is correct. Little friend Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength is indeed above that of the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.&#x201D;</p><p>After hearing those words, the bystanders all discovered that the Heaven Taboo: Heaven Devouring Wind that Chu Feng had unleashed was still spiraling in the sky.</p><p>It was only when the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master unleashed three Heaven Taboo Martial Skills in succession that he managed to neutralize Chu Feng&#x2019;s Heaven Taboo: Heaven Devouring Wind.</p><p>However, after the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master neutralized it, he was already panting and in a very sorry state.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
