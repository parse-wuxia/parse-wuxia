<p><strong>Chapter 2572 - The Arrival Of Calamity</strong></p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s you?&#x201D; Upon seeing this individual, Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed.</p><p>Chu Feng knew this man. He was Grandmaster Prophet.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s actually this old codger. Chu Feng, kill him. If it wasn&#x2019;t for his crazy prophecies, the Kong Heavenly Clan wouldn&#x2019;t have tried to kill you for no reason.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;All these things wouldn&#x2019;t have happened either,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Why are you here?&#x201D; Chu Feng narrowed his brows and asked coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I know that you harbor a grudge against this old man. However, this old man was forced without choice too.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This old man has been under the control of the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief the entire time. He possessed information that could have been used against me. If I did not make prophecies for him, he would have swept my reputation away completely,&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet spoke remorsefully.</p><p>&#x201C;What sort of information that can be used against you?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet started to hesitate.</p><p>&#x201C;Seems like you&#x2019;ve done shameful things before too,&#x201D; Chu Feng sneered.</p><p>Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that the so-called information that could be used against Grandmaster Prophet must be some sort of shady matter that was discovered by the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;It is a mistake that I made in my youth. I have regretted it the entire time,&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet said with a sigh.</p><p>&#x201C;Have you deliberately come here to apologize to me?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need. You can go, I will not kill you,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;I have indeed come here to apologize to you. However, I also have an important matter that I needed to inform you of,&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet said.</p><p>&#x201C;What sort of important matter?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, have a look,&#x201D; With his Prophecy Crystal Ball in hand, Grandmaster Prophet walked over to Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;That is&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng&#x2019;s expression changed upon seeing Grandmaster Prophet&#x2019;s Prophecy Crystal Ball. He was able to see that within the Prophecy Crystal Ball was a world.</p><p>Certain locations of that world felt so very familiar to him.</p><p>Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. The world within the Prophecy Crystal Ball was the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>However, corpses filled the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm within the Prophecy Crystal Ball. The earth was completely withered, and all living things had turned to ash. In fact, Chu Feng was able to feel a stifling sensation even though he was seeing the world through the Prophecy Crystal Ball.</p><p>&#x201C;What is going on?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;That is the prophecy that I&#x2019;ve just made. My prophecy predicted that in the near future, a great calamity will befall the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This great calamity will befall everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Not only will everyone lose their lives, but the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm itself will also turn into a barren land.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the person who is capable of preventing this calamity, he is right here,&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet said.</p><p>&#x201C;Who?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;There are only the three of us alive here. With my cultivation, it will naturally not be me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, it will either be you or Lord Ying Mingchao.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;One among you will be able to prevent this calamity,&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet said.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough of your nonsense. I do not believe your bullshit prophecy,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I am really not deceiving you. Even if you do not believe me, you must believe this Prophecy Crystal Ball. This Prophecy Crystal Ball is something given to me by a divine individual. All these years, it has never once prophesied wrongly.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you must definitely believe me. You must prepare with Lord Ying Mingchao. Whether or not the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will be able to survive will all depend on the two of you ,&#x201D; Grandmaster Prophet said.</p><p>&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re so scared of death, you can go and hide in the Upper Realms,&#x201D; Chu Feng mocked.</p><p>At that moment, Grandmaster Prophet revealed a wry smile. He said, &#x201C;I do want to enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Merely, this old man&#x2019;s cultivation is insufficient. Even though I want to go there, I will not be able to.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Sure enough, you are a craven and cowardly individual. Scram immediately.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng cast a side-eye at that Grandmaster Prophet. He discovered that Grandmaster Prophet simply did not possess the demeanor of a Grandmaster.</p><p>He was merely a selfish individual who held no regard for others. Even the fact that he came to tell Chu Feng about the prophecy was because he himself did not wish to suffer a calamity.</p><p>A person like him was truly a hypocrite.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I know that you harbor hard feelings against this old man. However, this old man is truly only calling this matter to your attention out of kind intentions. You must definitely make preparations.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, Grandmaster Prophet looked to the intoxicated Ying Mingchao, &#x201C;You must definitely inform Lord Ying Mingchao about this too.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, Grandmaster Prophet soared into the sky. With his Prophecy Crystal Ball in hand, he left.</p><p>After Grandmaster Prophet left, Chu Feng started to ponder. He suddenly felt that Grandmaster Prophet&#x2019;s words didn&#x2019;t seem to be lies.</p><p>A calamity. What sort of calamity would it be?</p><p>Who was capable of bringing a calamity to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?</p><p>Could it be that Blue Gown?</p><p>Chu Feng thought about it for some time. However, apart from those from the Upper Realms, he didn&#x2019;t seem to be able to think of anyone else capable of bringing a calamity to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>However, suddenly, Chu Feng looked to his Evil God Sword that he was still holding in his hand. Although the Evil God Sword was calm at that moment Chu Feng knew very well how frightening it was.</p><p>He knew that the Evil God Sword was a potential menace that could bring about a calamity to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p><p>Upon thinking of that point, Chu Feng put his Evil God Sword away.</p><p>&#x201C;Brother Chu Feng, quickly, come, come drink.&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Ying Mingchao arrived beside Chu Feng with two jugs of wine in his hands.</p><p>Seeing the current Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng felt sorry for him.</p><p>From the battle between Ying Mingchao and the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief earlier, Chu Feng was able to tell how much of a grand and imposing individual Ying Mingchao was.</p><p>He&#x2026; was truly a great hero.</p><p>However, the current Ying Mingchao was so very haggard and disheveled. He was in enormous pain because of his beloved woman.</p><p>Sure enough, pain to one&#x2019;s heart greatly surpassed pain to one&#x2019;s body.</p><p>&#x201C;Come, let&#x2019;s drink.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng received the jug of wine from Ying Mingchao and toasted it with the jug of wine Ying Mingchao was holding. Then, he drained the entire jug with a single gulp.</p><p>Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao drank in the Kong Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s ruins for an entire day and night.</p><p>However, as the Kong Heavenly Clan was razed to the ground, there would sooner or later be people who would discover the matter.</p><p>As such, Chu Feng felt that it was unsuitable to continue to stay there and drink. Thus, he brought the still-intoxicated Ying Mingchao somewhere else.</p><p>In the days that followed Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao indulged in only one thing -- drinking.</p><p>However, Chu Feng was never intoxicated the entire time. With his body&#x2019;s composition, ordinary poisons were simply unable to do anything to him. This was the case for even alcohol.</p><p>However, Ying Mingchao was drunk the entire time. He truly drank too much. Furthermore, he was growing more and more drunk.</p><p>Chu Feng wanted to urge him to stop drinking. However, he didn&#x2019;t know how to start.</p><p>This was especially true when Ying Mingchao started calling for Zi Xunyi nonstop in his sleep. This made Chu Feng feel even more sorry for him.</p><p>With the situation at hand, Chu Feng thought that the only way to help Ying Mingchao would be to bring him and wander around to places without signs of human activity, to places where mutual deception was not present, places without the struggles of martial cultivators, yet possessing beautiful scenery.</p><p>He hoped that the various sceneries of the world would gradually wake Ying Mingchao.</p><p>Chu Feng did not have an extravagant hope in being able to have Ying Mingchao let go of Zi Xunyi completely, because he knew that something like that would be impossible.</p><p>That said, Chu Feng hoped that Ying Mingchao would be able to pull himself together. After all, no matter what sort of setback one were to face, one must still live one&#x2019;s life properly.</p><p>&#x201C;What happened over there?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu feng was bringing Ying Mingchao toward a lake. On the way there, Chu Feng passed by a city.</p><p>Although they were still far from the city, he was able to see that the city was filled with corpses.</p><p>Actually, massacring everyone in a captured city was a common occurrence. The world of martial cultivators was cruel like that.</p><p>However, the massacre of that city was somewhat strange. The reason for that was because practically all the people in the city died from their bodies exploding. As such, the reek of blood filled the entire place. It was truly a nauseating sensation.</p><p>However, it was not that there were no corpses in the city. Merely, the corpses in the city would make one&#x2019;s blood run cold. The reason for that was because they were all infants.</p><p>Furthermore, those infant corpses all possessed an identical characteristic. That is, they had all died miserably. They were all completely withered like mummies.</p><p>If one must describe their corpses, then it would best be described that their corpses greatly resembled the five Zhou Heavenly Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders that had died in the Kong Heavenly Clan that day.</p><p>Those infants had all been refined to death.</p><p>Furthermore, they were refined alive.</p><p>&#x201C;How could this be?&#x201D;</p><p>It was unknown whether it was because he was roused by the pungent smell of blood or by the corpses of those infants, but Ying Mingchao actually woke up.</p><p>&#x201C;This!!!&#x201D; Upon properly seeing the corpses of those infants, Ying MIngchao revealed a startled expression.</p><p>Those were infants. They were newborn infants that had yet to experience the world, infants that did not know anything at all.</p><p>Yet, just like that, they were refined alive. Before their death, they suffered unimaginable torture.</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
