<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1781 - Losing All Face</strong></p><p>Chapter 1781 - Losing All Face</p><p>&#x201C;Feixue!!!&#x201D;</p><p>While the others were unable to distinguish who the person that had been shot out from the fort was, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was able to instantly tell that it was his son the moment he heard Ximen Feixue&#x2019;s scream.</p><p>Upon closer inspection of Ximen Feixue, he was overwhelmed with shock and horror. Disregarding the formation with the troops he had brought with him, his body shifted, and he arrived in the sky to catch Ximen Feixue.</p><p>&#x201C;Feixue, what happened? Who left you with such a serious injury?&#x201D; The Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief looked to his son in his bosom. While he was angered by the appearance of his son, he was mainly feeling heartache for the sufferings his son had obviously experienced.</p><p>Ximen Feixue was the most outstanding talent to have appeared in their Ximen Imperial Clan for the past several tens of thousands of years. He was also his most beloved son. The Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had always considered Ximen Feixue to be his treasure.</p><p>In fact, the reason why he detested Chu Feng like he did was all because Chu Feng had publicly humiliated his son.</p><p>And now, his son had been beaten to such a state by someone. How could he not be enraged?</p><p>&#x201C;Father, your son has disappointed you. I was actually the first to be eliminated,&#x201D; Ximen Feixue laughed bitterly. He felt that he was too ashamed to face his father.</p><p>&#x201C;Eliminated?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was startled. Then, he became extremely angry. With a voice many times louder than thunder, he shouted at the fort down below, &#x201C;Why was my son eliminated from the competition?!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Once that voice was heard, many of the crowd below hurriedly covered their ears. The reason for that was because this voice was simply too ear-piercing.</p><p>&#x201C;Eliminated? Why would he be eliminated?&#x201D;</p><p>Although the voice was very ear-piercing, the crowd was able to clearly hear that Ximen Feixue had been eliminated.</p><p>&#x201C;Ximen Feixue disobeyed the rules. Before the competition began, he provoked and insulted another participant to force a fight. As such, I had to kick him out of the competition.&#x201D;</p><p>A man&#x2019;s voice sounded from within the fort. The voice was loud and resounding, so much so that it surpassed even the Ximen Imperial Clan Clan Chief&#x2019;s voice. Although that voice was very loud, it was not ear-piercing at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Amazing!&#x201D; At this moment, the crowd were all startled. With merely that sentence, the crowd was able to tell that the man inside the fort possessed strength above the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;It is one thing to kick him out, but why did you injure my son?&#x201D; The Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It is not I who injured your son. Instead, he provoked Chu Feng, only to end up being injured by him,&#x201D; The man&#x2019;s voice sounded from the fort again.</p><p>&#x201C;What? It was Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, Ximen Feixue was kicked out from the competition because he provoked Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Holy shit. It&#x2019;s one thing to be kicked out of the competition by provoking Chu Feng. However, he actually got beaten to such a state by Chu Feng too?&#x201D;</p><p>The crowd were all able to clearly hear the words spoken by that man. At this moment, many people began to snicker.</p><p>This matter was truly humiliating.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng! It&#x2019;s that Chu Feng again!&#x201D; After hearing the name &#x2018;Chu Feng&#x2019;, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was so angry that his veins were violently bulging. Boundless killing intent was surging in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuaah.&#x201D; Right at this moment, Ximen Feixue&#x2019;s mouth was opened wide. Then, with a &#x2018;puu,&#x2019; he sprayed out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Due to being caught off guard, Ximen Feixue&#x2019;s mouthful of blood sprayed directly onto the Ximen Imperial Clans&#x2019; Clan Chief&#x2019;s face and body.</p><p>&#x201C;Feixue, what happened?&#x201D; Being sprayed with his son&#x2019;s blood, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was not only not angered, he instead revealed a very worried expression.</p><p>Although Ximen Feixue had been seriously injured, those were, after all, only physical, external injuries. However, after Ximen Feixue sprayed out that mouthful of blood, his entire aura became incomparably weak. This was an internal injury.</p><p>&#x201C;Father, your son is incompetent. The Heavenly Immortal Sword has been snatched away by that Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Right now, the Heavenly Immortal Sword is no longer your son&#x2019;s,&#x201D; Ximen Feixue laughed bitterly. His gaze was filled with incomparable frustration and disappointment.</p><p>Not only had he been defeated, he had been utterly defeated. He had truly failed and wiped over the floor with his defeat.</p><p>&#x201C;Am I mishearing things? Ximen Feixue&#x2019;s Heavenly Immortal Sword has been snatched away by Chu Feng? Furthermore, Chu Feng has severed his connection with the Heavenly Immortal Sword? Is that why Ximen Feixue vomited blood?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But, the battle between Ximen Feixue and Chu Feng should have just ended. That Heavenly Immortal Sword should have just been snatched away by Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Holy mother of god! Exactly what sort of demon-level character is that Chu Feng? How could he be this powerful to be able to sever the relationship between Ximen Feixue and the Heavenly Immortal Sword in such a short period of time? One must know that the Heavenly Immortal Sword is no ordinary Incomplete Imperial Armament!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding crowd had all perked up their ears. Thus, they were able to clearly hear each and every word that Ximen Feixue said.</p><p>After learning of what had happened, other than being amazed, they only felt more shock. They were all shocked by Chu Feng.</p><p>The gasps of shock from the surrounding crowd were like countless sharp blades when they entered the ears of the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief. Those sharp blades were stabbing into his bones and making him feel utterly humiliated.</p><p>Suddenly, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief shouted, &#x201C;Insolent!!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Then, with an extremely angry gaze, he stared down at the fort below him, pointed at it and asked with incomparable rage, &#x201C;You kicked my son out of the competition because he broke the rules. Yet, that Chu Feng also broke the rules. Why have you not kicked him out?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Why is it that you care about my son breaking the rules, and yet did nothing when my son was being injured by that Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;When my son&#x2019;s Heavenly Immortal Sword was snatched away by that Chu Feng, why did you do nothing about it?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What sort of host are you? Do you even have a trace of impartiality in you?&#x201D;</p><p>His voice shook the heavens and echoed nonstop. The Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was truly enraged. He was so utterly enraged that he had lost all ability to reason.</p><p>&#x201C;Your son was the one who initiated the provocation. Thus, he invited the consequences upon himself,&#x201D; These words sounded from the fort. However, merely those two sentences were enough to display that man&#x2019;s attitude toward this matter.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re fucking bullshitting me!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Finally, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief exploded into a violent rage. Unable to contain himself anymore, he cursed out loud. Then, his body turned into a ray of light and, with his right fist clenched tightly, he shot his fist that contained the might of a rank three Martial Emperor toward the fort.</p><p>&#x201C;Booom~~~&#x201D;</p><p>His fist instantly brought about a loud explosion that echoed nonstop. Violent energy ripples sprung forth. Many of the surrounding crowd were knocked flying by the energy ripples like kites with broken strings.</p><p>However, even after such a fist strike, the fort was still completely undamaged. Instead, it was the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief that was knocked several tens of thousand of meters away through the air like an arrow shot out from a bow.</p><p>At the moment when the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief managed to steady himself, blood began to flow out from the corner of his mouth, and the fist that he had used to strike at the fort had also become badly mutilated. Even the bones of his fist had been shattered.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; At this time, a snort sounded from the fort. It was filled with contempt.</p><p>However, even when facing that snort, the extremely enraged Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief did not attack the fort again. Other than the corners of his mouth that started to twitch, he did nothing.</p><p>From merely that fist strike, he had realized the disparity between him and that man.</p><p>&#x201C;Sssss~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing this scene, the crowd present were all unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p><p>They had thought that the master of the fort was an extraordinary existence. And now, it would appear that it was exactly as they had expected.</p><p>At the very least, the grand Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief was unable to withstand a single blow from that man.</p><p>Deep underground outside of the fort, the Four Great Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders were also paying attention to what was happening aboveground. They sighed, &#x201C;No matter what, that Ximen is a Clan Chief. Why would his temper be this bad? Look at the situation now, he has disgraced himself in public. Not only has he lost face for the Ximen Imperial Clan, he has humiliated all of our Four Great Imperial Clans.&#x201D;</p><p>At this moment, the Dongfang, Beitang and Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s three Utmost Exalted Elders were all shaking their heads. They felt that the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief had been too impulsive.</p><p>Only the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder remained silent. However, at this moment, coldness filled his aged eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, this old man will definitely dismember your body into ten thousand pieces.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, the Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder said those words while gnashing his teeth in anger.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
