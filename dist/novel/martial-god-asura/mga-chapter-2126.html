<p><strong> Chapter 2126 - Journeying Together </strong></p><p>&#x201C;Overlord,&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s merely a false reputation.&#x201D;</p><p>After saying those words, Chu Feng looked to the sky. That was a place where their powers were incapable of reaching.</p><p>Only by entering the Stairway to Heaven would they be able to enter that place, the Outer World.</p><p>The so-called &#x2018;overlord&#x2019; in this place, exactly what sort of wave could they possibly cause in the Outer World? That was something that no one knew.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had a feeling that the overlords of this place would be nothing more than ants in the eyes of the people in the Outer World.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, even if it is a false reputation, it is still not something that just anyone could obtain.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;To the people of the Holy Land of Martialism, it is a belief, a belief that there will be someone who can prevent calamities when they appear.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And you, you are someone who is qualified to take up that reputation. You are someone who is capable of shouldering the people&#x2019;s belief,&#x201D; The Elf King said.</p><p>&#x201C;Your Majesty, although the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master is dead now, the Holy Land of Martialism is a complete mess.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For many powers, their homes have already been ruined. Regardless of whether they are monstrous beasts or humans, they will all have to rebuild their homes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;And for that&#x2026; I&#x2019;m afraid they will likely need the assistance of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves. Everyone&#x2026; still needs your assistance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for me, I will be going far away. Thus&#x2026; if there really must be an overlord for the people, I feel that you are more suited for that title,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, please don&#x2019;t joke around. Even if I were willing to accept it, the people of the Holy Land of Martialism would not be willing to bestow me that title.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You must not go telling the crowd that I should be the overlord. If you do, I suspect that they will try to drown me to death with their spit,&#x201D; The Elf King joked.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, the title of overlord belongs to only you. As such, stop trying to evade it. Even this old man feels that only you are capable of being the overlord,&#x201D; The Heaven Reaching Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, you are all truly overvaluing this Chu Feng,&#x201D; Chu Feng said in a somewhat ashamed manner.</p><p>If the only person who was able to obtain the will of the people could become the overlord, then that person must be someone who had done things with the intention of benefiting the people in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he had only defeated the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master. Furthermore, he had possessed a certain amount of selfishness in the battle between him and the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master.</p><p>However, in terms of fighting against the Dark Hall&#x2019;s Hall Master and protecting the people of the Holy Land of Martialism, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; contributions could not go unnoticed. Among them, their leader, the Elf King, was the one who had done the most.</p><p>Furthermore, although Chu Feng was still present in the Holy Land of Martialism right now, his heart had already entered the Outer World.</p><p>Chu Feng no longer cared about whatever reputation he might possess in the Holy Land of Martialism. However, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves would remain in the Holy Land of Martialism. A great reputation would increase the authority of the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves in being able to better govern the Holy Land of Martialism in the future.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I know what you are thinking. We Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves appreciate your kind intentions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The people here are no fools. They are all martial cultivators that possess wisdom. They also possess the ability to differentiate between good and bad.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;For them to acknowledge you as the overlord means that you are the overlord. Even if you refuse the title, you will still remain the overlord in their hearts,&#x201D; The Elf King said.</p><p>Finally, Chu Feng sighed and reached a compromise. &#x201C;Forget about it,&#x201D; he said. After all, what the Elf King said was very reasonable.</p><p>Suddenly, the Heaven Reaching Immortal asked, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you just said earlier that you&#x2019;ll be going far away; where are you planning to go? Could it be that you&#x2019;re planning to return to the Eastern Sea Region?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to the Outer World,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Outer World?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, the crowd present all revealed expressions of shock.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you know how to enter the Outer World?&#x201D; The Elf King hurriedly asked. As he spoke those words, he glanced at his daughter, Xian Miaomiao.</p><p>&#x201C;In the Eastern Sea Region&#x2019;s Misty Peak is a formation by the name of &#x2018;Stairway to Heaven.&#x2019; Through that Stairway to Heaven, one can enter the Outer World.&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng did not mention the Realm of Gods. Although these people were all people that he trusted, he still did not wish to break the rules of the Realm of Gods.</p><p>Chu Feng hoped to be able to leave behind a pure land for the blind old man and the others.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, is what you speak of for real?&#x201D; The Elf King became even more emotional.</p><p>&#x201C;I plan to return to the Eastern Sea Region to take care of some things. After I finish taking care of those things, I plan to directly leave for the Outer World from the Eastern Sea Region.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Miaomiao, you should accompany me. I have a feeling that the Outer World will have abundant cultivation resources. With your talent, your future prospects will look better there,&#x201D; Chu Feng said to Xian Miaomiao.</p><p>He had promised the Elf King to take Xian Miaomiao to the Outer World with him. And now, as Chu Feng planned to leave for the Outer World, he would naturally have to take Xian Miaomiao with him.</p><p>Furthermore, Xian Miaomiao really did possess a very strong talent. In fact, Chu Feng faintly felt that Xian Miaomiao&#x2019;s talent surpassed his own. She would definitely be able to gain a foothold in the Outer World.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, I already know about the things concerning my mother. However, I do not wish to enter the Outer World just yet,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said.</p><p>&#x201C;Miaomiao, you belong to the Outer World,&#x201D; The Elf King urged.</p><p>&#x201C;Royal Father, I will leave for the Outer World. I also wish to find my biological mother. However, I wish to accompany you and big sister for some time longer,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao looked to the Elf King and Princess Lingyue. A reluctance to part filled her beautiful eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Royal Father, since Miaomiao wishes to stay some time longer, you shouldn&#x2019;t urge her to leave. Just let her stay for a while longer. After all, she&#x2019;s still so young,&#x201D; Princess Lingyue was also reluctant to part with her sister Miaomiao. Thus, she urged her father to let her stay.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; The Elf King nodded. As Xian Miaomiao was his own daughter, how could he be willing to see her go? He actually also wished for Xian Miaomiao to accompany them for some time more.</p><p>&#x201C;Miaomiao, even if you proceed for the Outer World by yourself in the future, it would still be best for you to accompany me to the Eastern Sea Region this time around.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll bring you to see the formation that leads to the Outer World, so you&#x2019;ll know how to enter the Outer World when you plan to go there in the future,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;But, isn&#x2019;t the spatial crack that leads to the Eastern Sea Region a vicious one?&#x201D; Princess Lingyue asked worriedly.</p><p>&#x201C;I have discovered another spatial crack. This spatial crack is benign in nature and very safe,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Since that&#x2019;s the case, let&#x2019;s all go there together. As little friend Chu Feng will be leaving, we should all see him off,&#x201D; The Heaven Reaching Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;Great, great, great. Let&#x2019;s all go together. I have never been to the Eastern Sea Region before. I want to see exactly what sort of place Chu Feng grew up in is like. I also want to see Chu Feng&#x2019;s friends and relatives in the Eastern Sea Region,&#x201D; Xian Miaomiao said excitedly.</p><p>&#x201C;Since even the Heaven Reaching Immortal plans to go, we naturally cannot be absent,&#x201D; The Elf King said those words, then took a glance back at Bali Xuankong, Nangong Longjian, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Compass Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and the other people with superb relationships with Chu Feng.</p><p>Seeing his glance, everyone nodded excitedly. They could be considered to be people that had seen Chu Feng&#x2019;s growth with their own eyes, people that possessed very deep sentiments for Chu Feng. They would naturally want to see him off now that he was planning to leave. No one would be able to stop them.</p><p>&#x201C;Four seniors, are you all planning to come too?&#x201D; Chu Feng looked to the Four Great Divine Beasts.</p><p>Although Chu Feng possessed an overwhelming status in the Holy Land of Martialism, he had not even been born when the Four Great Divine Beasts had been renowned through the Holy Land of Martialism. Thus, by comparison, they were indeed his seniors.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you are our master. We will follow wherever our master goes,&#x201D; The Azure Dragon said. Its voice was very resounding, and without the slightest amount of restraint. Thus, not only did the Elf King hear those words, everyone present heard those words.</p><p>&#x201C;Ssss~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing those words, many of the people present sucked in a mouthful of cold air.</p><p>The Four Great Divine Beasts were very powerful existences; they were four Half Martial Ancestors. Furthermore, they were beings that were already renowned in the Holy Land of Martialism ten thousand years ago.</p><p>Although the current Chu Feng possessed the strength to subdue the four of them, the crowd remained fired up upon hearing from the Azure Dragon that Chu Feng was indeed their master. This only served to confirm that this era&#x2019;s overlord would be none other than Chu Feng.</p><p>After it was decided, the crowd began to fly toward the Eastern Sea Region. Not only did the experts from the older generation follow Chu Feng, even the people from the younger generation like Tantai Xue and Sima Ying followed Chu Feng too.</p><p>Naturally, Jiang Wushang and Zhang Tianyi were also among the crowd. After all, to them, the Eastern Sea Region and the Nine Provinces Continent was also their homeland.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
