<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 634 - Head of the Nine Immortals</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;All right? You look at her. If she were all right, then she wouldn&#x2019;t have been sealed by me. If you want her to be all right, the monster must be taken out of her body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But, you don&#x2019;t need to worry. I have an old friend and her Spirit Formation techniques are quite superb. She also grasps techniques ordinary people do not know of, and she studies a lot about this kind of monster. Perhaps she could even help your friend,&#x201D; said Qiushui Fuyan.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then sorry to trouble you, Senior.&#x201D; Chu Feng hurried thanked her upon hearing her words.</span></p><p><span style="">If it were before, maybe Chu Feng wouldn&#x2019;t have been so worried about Yan Ruyu&#x2019;s life; however, after seeing the pain she had endured, and especially as she didn&#x2019;t kill him, he truly wanted to help Yan Ruyu out. After all, looking at it from a certain perspective, the reason why Yan Ruyu turned into her current state was really because of him.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;First, stop feigning concern. Wanting to save her is fine, but before that, I still have some things I wish to ask you. Follow me.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As Qiushui Fuyan spoke, she flicked her hand, calling Chu Feng and the others all to her, and simultaneously, was already flying.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Senior Qiushui, the Everlasting Sea of Blood is ahead. Could it be that you want to go there?&#x201D; However, looking in the direction Qiushui Fuyan was heading towards, Chu Feng felt greatly confused.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. I am heading to the Everlasting Sea of Blood for a night&#x2019;s rest,&#x201D; she answered.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But...&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;But what? But that&#x2019;s the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s territory?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. Others fear the Immortal Execution Archipelago, but I do not.&#x201D; Qiushui Fuyan coldly smiled. Judging by her tone she didn&#x2019;t put the Immortal Execution Archipelago in her eyes at all.</span></p><p><span style="">And Chu Feng could understand why Qiushui Fuyan acted like so. After all, he had learnt some things from his master, Qiu Canfeng.</span></p><p><span style="">At present, the Immortal Execution Archipelago was indeed strong, that was something indisputable; but after all, in the times when the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Burning Heaven Church prospered, the Immortal Execution Archipelago wasn&#x2019;t really anything.</span></p><p><span style="">So, no matter how much stronger the Immortal Execution Archipelago became, in the eyes of the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Burning Heaven Church, it was nothing more than a force that rose in power because of the lack of stronger forces in the Eastern Sea Region. Especially for people who had very high positions before in the Eastern Sea Region such as Qiushui Fuyan and Qiu Canfeng, to an even greater degree, they looked down on the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">But Chu Feng knew that it was indeed very strong. It was something he could see from what he gathered after arriving in the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p><p><span style="">And even though Qiushui Fuyan was powerful, in terms of aura, she was quite a distance from Qiu Canfeng and Huangfu Haoyue. It meant that even if she had entered the realm of Martial Kings, she likely didn&#x2019;t have a very high rank.</span></p><p><span style="">With her cultivation, no matter how one looked at it, declaring war at the Immortal Execution Archipelago was too far of a stretch. If it were one person, then it would be fine; but now, bringing them to the Everlasting Sea of Blood for a rest&#x2026; If the Immortal Execution Archipelago coincidentally had reinforcements, then that would not be a good situation.</span></p><p><span style="">However, Qiushui Fuyan was a senior, after all, and her nature was very domineering. So even though Chu Feng felt that it wasn&#x2019;t a good arrangement, he couldn&#x2019;t say much else, and could only follow.</span></p><p><span style="">Like that, Chu Feng and the others swaggeringly entered the Everlasting Sea of Blood, and even rented a little floating island for resting.</span></p><p><span style="">News about this also quickly spread.</span></p><p><span style="">For the uninitiated, it wasn&#x2019;t really much, as it was only some important person who came to the Everlasting Sea of Blood. Some people even felt that it was good news because that person would definitely provide some assistance in catching the monster.</span></p><p><span style="">But to Ya Fei, she was so angry she couldn&#x2019;t sit relaxed. The angry her almost destroyed her own residence.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit, bastard, this is truly despicable! She even dares to come to my Everlasting Sea of Blood for a rest? She is goading me! She is goading my Immortal Execution Archipelago!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Daoist Qiushui? Lovers Terrace? Pah!</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;If you back me into a wall, I&#x2019;ll stamp your entire Lovers Terrace flat! Go ahead, be arrogant, be wild!&#x201D; Ya Fei was so angry even her internal organs could explode. She, who had no place to vent her anger, could only roar and curse and smash and break things in her own room to release her fury.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Ya Fei, this servant wishes to see you for a matter.&#x201D; Though just at that moment, a female voice suddenly rang out from the outside.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t listen to anything, scram right now!&#x201D; Ya Fei was currently in a rage, so how could she be in the mood to listen to such troubling things? She howled furiously at the door, and as she howled, she attached a strand of pressure, which then pierced through the door, and forced the female, a rank three Martial Lord, away in the air, injuring her slightly.</span></p><p><span style="">A hint of displeasure and anger emerged onto the female&#x2019;s face when she was treated like that by Ya Fei. After all, she was a Martial Lord too, and her rank wasn&#x2019;t low. In front of Ya Fei perhaps she wasn&#x2019;t much, but in front of others she was definitely a great genius.</span></p><p><span style="">Resentment birthed from her heart when a person such as herself had to service another person like slave. But when she occasionally even needed to bear Ya Fei&#x2019;s bursts of anger, any person would feel displeased.</span></p><p><span style="">However, not only did she dare not let a hint of displeasure and anger manifest, those emotions even flashed by, and replacing them was her usual smile of both respect and fear.</span></p><p><span style="">It was because as long as she thought of Ya Fei&#x2019;s position in the Immortal Execution Archipelago, she really didn&#x2019;t dare to show bad temper. Especially when she saw the letter currently in her hands, even more so, she didn&#x2019;t dare to show bad temper.</span></p><p><span style="">Although the Immortal Execution Archipelago was powerful at present, there were very, very few people who were like Ya Fei&#x2014;having a hundred Martial Lords behind her, and all of them being young, beautiful, outstandingly talented females.</span></p><p><span style="">The reason why Ya Fei could have such treatment was not only because she was the fianc&#xE9;e of the young archipelago master, Murong Xun; more importantly, it was because Ya Fei had a powerful grandfather.</span></p><p><span style="">In the Immortal Execution Archipelago, the strongest person was the archipelago master. Other than him, there were also nine others who held extremely strong strength and controlled a region of land. These nine people were people who had accomplished great services and deeds for the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p><p><span style="">People called the nine of them the Nine Immortals, and Ya Fei&#x2019;s grandfather was the head of the Nine Immortals. It could be said that her grandfather&#x2019;s position in the Immortal Execution Archipelago was &#x201C;under one person and above ten thousand&#x201D;. Naturally, many people did not dare offend such a person. It was also the main reason why Ya Fei could be so arrogant and disdainful, without fearing others.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Lady Ya Fei, it&#x2019;s a letter from Lord First Immortal.&#x201D; After organizing her emotions, the female, the rank three Martial Lord, once again spoke out with respect.</span></p><p><span style="">*bam* And upon hearing those words, the tightly shut door suddenly opened, and Ya Fei&#x2019;s beautiful body also appeared in front of the door.</span></p><p><span style="">After seeing the letter in the female&#x2019;s hands, Ya Fei immediately took it away, tore it open, and started reading.</span></p><p><span style="">The more she read, the more the fury on the face subsided. At the end, she went from angry to joyful, as her face brimmed with an incomparably dazzling smile. She put away the letter, and said to the female, &#x201C;Prepare well. Tonight, my grandfather will come. But remember, do not let anyone know about this. This news must remain a secret.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
