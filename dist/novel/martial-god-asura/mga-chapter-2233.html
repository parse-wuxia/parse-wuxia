<p><strong> Chapter 2233 - Chu Feng&#x2019;s Arrival</strong></p><p>After Chu Feng killed Li Rui, he collected his clothing, personal items and Cosmos Sack.</p><p>&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you check what treasures might be in his Cosmos Sack?&#x201D; Eggy asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;I will not touch his things. I am going to hand them to Xu Yiyi intact,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Why do you plan to hand them to her? You couldn&#x2019;t possibly be trying to let her know that you&#x2019;ve killed Li Rui, right?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Milady Queen, while I can deceive others, I cannot deceive Xu Yiyi. After all, she has treated me with sincerity,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay, okay, do as you wish,&#x201D; Eggy said indifferently.</p><p>Then, Chu Feng entered the teleportation formation. When he appeared again, he had arrived at the summit of Mount Cloud Crane.</p><p>This so-called summit was very vast. Even though white clouds covered the surroundings, it still had an enormous surface area. To put it simply, it looked like a small-scale plain floating in the sky.</p><p>The first thing that appeared in Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes was a grand formation. That grand formation was flickering with golden light, and looked like a magnificent building.</p><p>Furthermore, Immortal-level spirit power was flowing through it. Additionally, there were Dragon Marks shown in that spirit power. That spirit power was extremely fascinating. As a world spiritist, Chu Feng was involuntarily attracted to it.</p><p>Likely, that was the comprehensive spirit formation set up by the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p><p>Merely, to ascend to that comprehensive spirit formation would not be a simple task.</p><p>One first had to pass through a grand formation. At that moment, there were over a hundred people in that grand formation. Among them were Grandmaster Pocket, Daoist Three Swords and Liu Xiaoli.</p><p>To Chu Feng&#x2019;s surprise, there were already three people that had passed through that grand spirit formation, and were standing outside the comprehension formation.</p><p>Those three individuals were the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; second, third and fourth brothers.</p><p>Although they had managed to pass the grand formation and reach that comprehension spirit formation, the three of them did not immediately enter that comprehensive formation. Instead, they were standing there and waiting.</p><p>The person they were waiting for was none other than their eldest brother.</p><p>At that moment, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; eldest was fighting against Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords.</p><p>To Chu Feng&#x2019;s surprise, the two experts, Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords, were actually being suppressed by the single eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor.</p><p>However, they were fighting with fists. Furthermore, they were not fighting using martial power. Rather, they were using a special sort of spirit power. That power originated from the armor they were wearing.</p><p>That armor were created with spirit power. However, they were very special. At this moment, the source of everyone&#x2019;s power originated from those armors.</p><p>Furthermore, the armors were all slightly different. The great majority of the people were wearing silver armor, and a small portion of them were wearing bronze armor.</p><p>However, the Four World Spiritist Emperors, Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords, the six of them, were wearing golden armor.</p><p>Although their strength did not differ enormously, it was clear that the golden color was the strongest, while the silver color was weaker, and the bronze color was the weakest.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, you&#x2019;re finally here,&#x201D; Suddenly, the Sunset Cloud Valley&#x2019;s Elder Ning Shuang hurriedly ran toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Ning Shuang, what is going on here?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked curiously.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve come late, and still don&#x2019;t know about the rules here. Let me explain them to you,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang pointed at the entrance of the grand formation the people were in and said, &#x201C;Look over there. That is the entrance. That is not an ordinary entrance. Instead, it is a spirit formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;By entering that place, that place will suit you up with armor depending on the strength of your spirit power.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Once the spirit armor is placed onto your body, all of your martial power will be restricted. Thus, the power you can use to fight with will only be the power granted by that world spirit armor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After you are given a suit of armor, you will be able to enter that grand formation and fight with others. As long as you defeat all of the people present, you will be sent to the comprehension formation.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, if your spirit power is insufficient, not only will you be unable to obtain armor, you will also be sent out by that formation. You will not even be qualified to enter.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I, as well as all these other people here, are people who have failed to enter,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang pointed to the people standing outside the spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s the case,&#x201D; Chu Feng finally understood why Elder Ning Shuang was standing here. It turned out that his world spirit power was not strong enough, which made him unqualified to even get a suit of armor.</p><p>Thinking of that, Chu Feng took a glance toward Liu Xiaoli, who was in the formation. Even though she had not been given golden armor, she was wearing silver armor. This indirectly showed that Liu Xiaoli&#x2019;s spirit power was quite decent.</p><p>&#x201C;The situation right now seems to be bad. It appears that the Four World Spiritist Emperors are trying to dominate all four spots,&#x201D; Chu Feng suddenly said.</p><p>After all, the second, third and fourth brothers of the Four World Spiritist Emperors had already exited the formation. If the eldest brother were to also exit the formation, it would be hopeless for the rest of them.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right. The Four World Spiritist Emperors&#x2019; world spirit techniques are truly too strong. After donning the armor, even Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket are no match for the four of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You can see it too. Right now, three of them have already successfully exited the formation. Only their eldest remains. However, he, by himself, is actually able to contend against both Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If this is to continue, I fear that Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket will not be able to stop them. The four brothers will end up occupying all four spots,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang said.</p><p>&#x201C;The way I see it, Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket are simply unable to stop him,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Unable to stop him?&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang was surprised.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes, they are unable to stop him. If he wanted to leave, he would&#x2019;ve been able to do so long ago. The reason why he has stayed so long is to deliberately toy with Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s actually toying with Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket?&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang was even more shocked. After all, Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket were prodigies in terms of world spirit techniques too.</p><p>&#x201C;Earlier, Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket spoke out for me. Thus, they felt grievances toward them. Merely, as their strength was inferior to theirs, they did not dare to do anything to them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, the situation is different now. Due to the Golden Crane True Immortal&#x2019;s spirit formation, they have finally obtained strength that surpasses that of Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;With the arrogant natures of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, they would naturally disregard consequences and take this chance to push Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket around,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Elder Ning Shuang turned his gaze toward the spirit formation again. He realized that Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket were painstakingly persisting. However, even with the two of them joining hands, they were truly no match for the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, quickly enter that spirit formation. There is only a single spot left. If you do not go now, the Four World Spiritist Emperors will likely end up occupying all four spots,&#x201D; Elder Ning Shuang said.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn, Elder Ning Shuang, I&#x2019;ll go then,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he walked toward the spirit formation.</p><p>Suddenly, Elder Ning Shuang asked, &#x201C;Chu Feng, where&#x2019;s Li Rui?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng revealed a very undisturbed expression. He turned around and said, &#x201C;Li Rui had a bit of an accident. I will tell you in detail later,&#x201D; Then, he entered the spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;Hahaha, Daoist Three Swords, Grandmaster Pocket, in terms of battle power, the two of you are many times stronger than me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, in terms of world spirit techniques, even if the two of you are to join hands, you are still no match for me,&#x201D; The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors mocked Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket while suppressing them.</p><p>While Grandmaster Pocket did not have too much of a reaction when being mocked by a member of the younger generation with strength much inferior to his own, Daoist Three Swords was so furious that his complexion turned deep red.</p><p>The more furious Daoist Three Swords appeared, the more complacent the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors felt. This was truly what he wanted to see.</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted, &#x201C;Everyone, look! It&#x2019;s Chu Feng! Chu Feng has arrived!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Once those words were heard, the expressions of everyone present changed.</p><p>When they saw that Chu Feng was stepping toward the entrance of the spirit formation, even the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors started to frown.</p><p>When not even Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords were a match for him, the only person that could defeat him would be Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
