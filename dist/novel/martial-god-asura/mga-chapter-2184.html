<p><strong> Chapter 2184 - Loss</strong></p><p>At the time when Chu Feng began his massacre, the innocent people had already escaped the city.</p><p>It was only after the rumbling stopped that the people dared to venture back into the city.</p><p>After the people saw that Chu Feng dared to kill even the people from Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion, they were stunned by Chu Feng&#x2019;s boldness to make Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion his enemy.</p><p>However, when the crowd saw that Chu Feng left many alive even after killing all of the Cao Family&#x2019;s elites, and that many of those that he left alive were children and members of the younger generation, the crowd&#x2019;s astonishment surpassed their astonishment toward Chu Feng&#x2019;s massacre.</p><p>After all, in the world of martial cultivators, massacres were common occurrences. If one didn&#x2019;t kill another, one would instead be killed by others. To be lenient toward one&#x2019;s enemy would be equivalent to being cruel to oneself.</p><p>That was why massacres were such a common occurrence. Killing all of one&#x2019;s enemy&#x2019;s family was nothing extraordinary either.</p><p>However, what Chu Feng had done, leaving people alive after a massacre, was something very rarely seen.</p><p>After all, if one did not eliminate the roots, it would cause no end to future trouble.</p><p>However, it was precisely because Chu Feng decided to spare the roots that he caught the attention of a group of people.</p><p>At this moment, those people were secretly following Chu Feng.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng who was walking in the sky suddenly turned around and shouted with a cold voice, &#x201C;Who is it?!&#x201D;</p><p>After his shout left his mouth, from the seemingly empty sky behind him appeared thirteen silhouettes.</p><p>There were men, women, old and young among these people. However, they all possessed a common feature; that was, they all had very ordinary appearances.</p><p>They were the sort of people who would be very hard to notice when placed in a crowd of people.</p><p>As for their cultivation, they were not very strong either. The weakest among them were Martial Kings, while the strongest were only Half Martial Emperors.</p><p>However, it would be impossible for them to tail Chu Feng with their cultivation. This meant that these people had used special methods to conceal their cultivations.</p><p>Their actual cultivations were definitely not as simple as what Chu Feng could determine.</p><p>Furthermore, Chu Feng had a sensation that the gray-clothed old man who led that group of thirteen was definitely capable of killing him instantly, that he was an absolute peak expert.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, please don&#x2019;t misunderstand. We are from the Red Butterfly Society. Thus, we hold absolutely no malice toward you,&#x201D; That leading gray-gowned old man said to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. His attitude was very amiable.</p><p>&#x201C;Red Butterfly Society?&#x201D; Chu Feng revealed a confused expression.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t even know about the Red Butterfly Society?&#x201D; Seeing that Chu Feng actually did not know about the Red Butterfly Society, a young man from the group revealed a displeased expression.</p><p>Although that man appeared to be around Chu Feng&#x2019;s age, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that he was at least ninety years old.</p><p>Although someone at that sort of age would still be considered a member of the younger generation in the world of martial cultivators, he would be a dying old man when considered among ordinary commoners.</p><p>As the attitude of that man was nasty, Chu Feng would naturally not respond with amiability. Thus, he asked disdainfully, &#x201C;Must I know about the Red Butterfly Society?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You bastard, you truly do not know the immensity of heaven and earth!!!&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng&#x2019;s attitude of disdain, that young man immediately revealed an ominous glint.</p><p>In response, that gray-cloaked old man shouted, &#x201C;Zhao Xiao, do not be rude!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Elder, I&#x2026;&#x201D; Being shouted down by that old man, that man by the name of Zhao Xiao was very displeased. However, in the end, he did not try to refute him, and instead moved to the side and spoke no more. It could be seen that he deeply feared that old man.</p><p>With a smile on his face, the old man asked Chu Feng, &#x201C;Little friend, your name is Chu Feng, right? May I address you by your name?&#x201D; His attitude was still very courteous.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course, a name is meant to be addressed. Senior, how should I address you?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked courteously.</p><p>&#x201C;This old man is surnamed Liu, and named Chengkun. I am one of the Red Butterfly Society&#x2019;s management elders.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for the Red Butterfly Society, it could be considered a special power. Our existence is so that we can confront the vicious powers that take advantage of their position to prey on the weak.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion, it is our main target. I can tell that you, Chu Feng, seem to have conflict with Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, I have come with the identity of the Red Butterfly Society&#x2019;s management elder to invite you to join our Red Butterfly Society so that you can confront Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion together with us,&#x201D; Elder Liu Chengkung said to Chu Feng.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s tensed heart was set at ease. Although he did not know what the Red Butterfly Society might be, it remained that they were, at the very minimum, not his enemies.</p><p>However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still shook his head apologetically and said, &#x201C;Thank you for your kind intentions. However, I do not plan to join any power.&#x201D;</p><p>This was a decision that Chu Feng had already made at an earlier time. He did not want to join any power because he did not wish to repeat the past and bring about harm to any power he joined.</p><p>He knew that he would definitely make enemies in the future. In fact, he had already made enemies.</p><p>Thus, he does not wish for any power he joined to be targeted after he escaped from his enemies.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, are you truly not planning to consider it? Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion is very powerful. As for that Yuan Zhen, he is Chu Luyang&#x2019;s trusted aide. Although his cultivation was not strong, he held a very high status that few in Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion could match. He was definitely not something that Cao Yuxuan could compare to.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Perhaps you might have still had a way out after killing Cao Yuxuan. However, after killing Yuan Zhen, Chu Luyang will definitely come for revenge even if he must dig three feet underground to find you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;In this sort of situation, it will be truly too dangerous for you to take on Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion alone.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, if you are to join us, we can guarantee your safety,&#x201D; Elder Liu Chengkun said.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Liu, I am truly sorry,&#x201D; Chu Feng shook his head. He was able to tell that Elder Liu Chengkun held good intentions. However, Chu Feng was determined. Thus, he would not accept the invitation.</p><p>&#x201C;You are truly one who cannot tell good from bad!&#x201D; In response, that man by the name of Zhao Xiu pointed at Chu Feng and shouted angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Zhao Xiao, shut up!&#x201D; In response, Elder Liu Chengkun once again shouted at Zhao Xiao.</p><p>Furthermore, he fiercely stared at Zhao Xiao. Then, he turned back around and said to Chu Feng, &#x201C;People have their own ambitions. Since little friend Chu Feng does not wish to join our Red Butterfly Society, I will also not force you to do so.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, I hope that little friend Chu Feng will not mention the fact that we have come to find you today.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, I understand these sorts of things. Merely, Elder Liu, you really should properly discipline your subordinate,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he looked to Zhao Xiao. Then, he added, &#x201C;His manners are truly lacking. You must know that not everyone will not bicker with him like the way I am.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You!!!&#x201D; Zhao Xiao wanted to say something. However, after sensing Elder Liu Chengkun&#x2019;s gaze, he swallowed the words that he wanted to say. That said, he was so furious that his complexion turned deep red and an unconcealed hostile coldness filled his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Faced with Zhao Xiao&#x2019;s fierce and malicious gaze, Chu Feng laughed disdainfully. If Elder Liu Chengkun wanted to do something to him, Chu Feng would definitely be scared. After all, there was an enormous difference in strength between them.</p><p>However, someone like Zhao Xiao was nothing more than a minor character. Chu Feng simply did not place him in his eyes at all.</p><p>&#x201C;Elder Liu, farewell. I hope that you all will stop following me,&#x201D; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he turned around and left.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, take care,&#x201D; This time around, Elder Liu Chengkun did not continue to follow Chu Feng.</p><p>After Chu Feng left, that Zhao Xiao said, &#x201C;Lord Elder, that man by the name of Chu Feng simply did not place us in his eyes. We must teach someone like him a lesson. How could we let him leave like that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Firstly, it is us who decided to invite him. As such, he had the right to refuse us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Secondly, our Red Butterfly Society is very low-profile to begin with. Furthermore, that Chu Feng is obviously not someone from this region. Thus, it is normal for him to not know about us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lastly, we are not Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion. The objective of our Red Butterfly Society is to get rid of evil for the people of the world, and attack those vicious powers that bully the weak.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If we are to attack Chu Feng just because he refused to join us, how will we be different from Luyang&#x2019;s Pavilion?&#x201D; Elder Liu Chengkun asked.</p><p>&#x201C;...&#x201D; Hearing that question, Zhao Xiao became speechless. Thus, in the end, he could only nod in an ashamed manner. &#x201C;Elder, I was foolish.&#x201D;</p><p>Even though he appeared to have admitted to his wrong, it could be seen from the expression in his eyes that Zhao Xiao did not feel that he was wrong.</p><p>As for Elder Liu Chengkun, he was looking at the direction that Chu Feng had left in the entire time. It was only after a long time passed that he shook his head and said, &#x201C;That child is most definitely not an ordinary person. In the future, his achievements will be inestimable. It is the loss of our Red Butterfly Society to fail in inviting that child into our Red Butterfly Society.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
