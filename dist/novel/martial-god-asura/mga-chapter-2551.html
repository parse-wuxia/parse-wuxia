<p><strong>Chapter 2551 - The Appearance Of Chu Feng</strong><br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Li Yue&#x2019;er was captured?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng realized that the situation was bad, and immediately started to observe his body.</p><p>Chu Feng had originally thought that Li Yue&#x2019;er was captured because the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation had lost its effectiveness.</p><p>However, his Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation was clearly still active.</p><p>He felt that the effective time for Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation should be the same as his. Since his was still present, Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation should still be effective too.</p><p>&#x201C;It shouldn&#x2019;t be Li Yue&#x2019;er, right?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;I feel like it&#x2019;s her. Regardless, I must go have a look.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>Chu Feng&#x2019;s body shifted. He started to rush toward the plaza where the wedding was to be held.</p><p>Upon arriving at the plaza, Chu Feng discovered that a vast crowd was already gathered at the vast plaza. There were tens of thousands of Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen present.</p><p>They all had angry expressions on their faces. Their eyes emitted unforgiving gazes as they stared at the center of the plaza.</p><p>As for Li Yue&#x2019;er, she was at the center of the plaza. The person they were staring at was Li Yue&#x2019;er.</p><p>&#x201C;She really was captured. How did this happen?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Could it be that someone managed to see through her Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation?&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng revealed a surprised expression. At that moment, Li Yue&#x2019;er was present before the crowd. Her Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation was no longer in effect.</p><p>However, it was clearly still within the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation&#x2019;s time limit. This meant that it was very possible that someone had managed to see through her Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.</p><p>However, the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation was such a powerful spirit formation. Who could possibly be able to see through it?</p><p>This was precisely the reason why Chu Feng was so astonished.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>That said, what was most important right now was the fact that there were two old men standing on either side of Li Yue&#x2019;er.</p><p>Although those two individuals were both white-haired and filled with wrinkles, they were very tall and possessed robust builds.</p><p>Those two individuals were both Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen. At that moment, one left and one right, the two of them had grabbed onto Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s arms and shoulders and forced her to kneel on the ground.</p><p>The auras emitted by those two old men had filled the entire region. They were extremely powerful.</p><p>Their auras had completely surpassed those of Martial Ancestors.</p><p>True Immortals. The two of them were True Immortals. They were two True Immortal-level experts.</p><p>Furthermore, they were not the only True Immortals present. At the highest location of the plaza was a gorgeous viewing platform. There was another True Immortal-level expert there.</p><p>Furthermore, the aura of that individual was much more robust than the two True Immortals holding down Li Yue&#x2019;er.</p><p>Rank two True Immortal. That individual was a rank two True Immortal.</p><p>Furthermore, judging from his high position and majestic airs, he should be the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s current Clan Chief.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a thorny problem now. The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief is actually a rank two True Immortal.&#x201D;</p><p>Her Lady Queen was worried. After all, rank two True Immortal could be said to be the apex level of cultivation in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&#x3000;<br>Event the four tier one powers only had rank two True Immortals as their leaders.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>In other words, facing the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan would be equivalent to facing one of the four tier one powers.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Is that Zi Xunyi?&#x201D;</p><p>Compared to the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief, Chu Feng cast his gaze to another individual on the viewing platform.</p><p>That individual was a human, a human woman. However&#x2026; she was not a beautifully flowery young woman.</p><p>Instead, her head was covered in white hair, her face was filled with wrinkles and age spots covered her entire body. She was an elderly lady who had been changed beyond recognition by her age.</p><p>However, that old lady was wearing a phoenix crown with red clouded wedding clothes.</p><p>She was the woman that the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief wanted to marry.</p><p>As such, she was most definitely Zi Xunyi.</p><p>&#x201C;Insolent thief, not only did you steal our Clan Chief&#x2019;s treasures, but you even dared to intrude upon Lady Zi Xunyi&#x2019;s sleeping chambers. Exactly what is your purpose?&#x201D;</p><p>A True Immortal that was holding down Li Yue&#x2019;er asked her with incomparable fury.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph.&#x201D;</p><p>However, Li Yue&#x2019;er did not answer him. Instead, she snorted at him disdainfully. Then, she revealed a cold smile.</p><p>&#x201C;You dare smile?!&#x201D; That True Immortal was extremely furious. Then, a resounding slap landed on Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s face.</p><p>The powerful slap caused one of Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s cheeks to swell. Blood flowed nonstop from her cheek and the corner of her mouth.</p><p>However, Li Yue&#x2019;er did not seem to have the slightest intention of giving in. Furthermore, she did not utter a single word. She continued to have a disdainful expression on her face.</p><p>&#x201C;What is going on with that girl? Didn&#x2019;t she say that her background is sufficient to scare the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen had a confused expression.</p><p>Logically, Li Yue&#x2019;er should be announcing her backing right now. Only by doing so would she be able to prevent the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan from torturing her.</p><p>However, not only did she not announce her power, but she even revealed such a disdainful expression. She was simply courting death here.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that she does not plan to announce her background. She never planned to rely on the power behind her from the very beginning.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;She only said those words because she wanted me to agree to have her accompany me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.<br>&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Why would this girl do that? After all, you are neither friends nor acquaintances with her,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen revealed a confused expression.</p><p>&#x201C;I also do not know why. Perhaps she thinks that a source energy gem and a martial comprehension bamboo slip are still insufficient to be even with me,&#x201D; Chu Feng guessed.</p><p>By &#x2018;even,&#x2019; Chu Feng naturally meant when he saved Li Yue&#x2019;er from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen.</p><p>It was because of that one rescue that Li Yue&#x2019;er had a complete change in attitude toward Chu Feng.</p><p>Li Yue&#x2019;er felt that she owed Chu Feng for her life. Even the extremely precious source energy gemstone and martial comprehension bamboo slip would not be sufficient to repay him for saving her.</p><p>That was why she was insistent on accompany Chu Feng on this dangerous journey.</p><p>At that moment, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked, &#x201C;Is this the thief that stole my Golden Gate Black Cloud Beads?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Clan Chief, it is him,&#x201D; Some Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen voiced in unison.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Where are my Golden Gate Black Cloud Beads?&#x201D; The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief asked Li Yue&#x2019;er.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; Li Yue&#x2019;er smiled with contempt at that question. After that, she spoke disdainfully, &#x201C;Ignorant fool, what Golden Gate Black Cloud Beads? Those are clearly the Sacred Temple Bead&#x2019;s locking beads.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Insolent thief!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You dare speak rudely toward our Lord Clan Chief?! You are simply courting death!&#x201D;</p><p>Hearing what Li Yue&#x2019;er said, the two True Immortals standing on either side of Li Yue&#x2019;er were immediately enraged. As they spoke, they planned to attack her again.</p><p>&#x201C;Wait,&#x201D; However, right at that moment, that Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief spoke to stop them.</p><p>Then, he asked, &#x201C;You have already stolen my treasures. Originally, you should have made your getaway. Why did you deliberately return and infiltrate Xunyi&#x2019;s sleeping chambers? I believe your intention was not merely to steal treasures, right?&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Speak, exactly what is your intention? Who sent you here?&#x201D;</p><p>As he spoke, his oppressive might swept forth aggressively. That powerful oppressive might was sufficient to make common folk piss themselves in terror.<br>&#x3000;<br>Not only would they immediately speak the truth, they would also start kowtowing and begging for forgiveness, begging to have their lives spared.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph,&#x201D; However, faced with that oppressive might, Li Yue&#x2019;er merely snorted and did not answer.</p><p>&#x201C;Did you really think that I do not dare kill you?&#x201D; The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief narrowed his eyebrows. His expression sunk.<br>&#x3000;<br>However, at that time, Li Yue&#x2019;er felt disinclined to even snort back.</p><p>Instead, she merely revealed an indifferent expression. This caused the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen to all gnash their teeth in enormous rage.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>The reason for that was because Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s actions could be said to be completely disregarding their Bloodscale Monstrous Clan.</p><p>&#x201C;Kill her! Dismember her into ten thousand pieces!!!&#x201D;</p><p>Furious shouts began to be heard from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen. Their voices were so resounding that it was like thunder exploding in the sky.<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>However, Li Yue&#x2019;er&#x2019;s expression remained unchanged the entire time. She continued to have a disdainful expression on her face.<br>&#x3000;<br>It was unknown whether she was truly unafraid of death, or whether she still possessed the ability to save herself.</p><p>&#x201C;Very well. If you want to die, I will help you succeed.&#x201D;<br>&#x3000;&#x3000;<br>&#x201C;Merely, I will not let you die a delightful death.&#x201D;</p><p>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&#x2019;s Clan Chief revealed his murderous desire. He was truly planning to kill Li Yue&#x2019;er.<br>&#x3000;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng shouted, &#x201C;Stop!!!&#x201D;</p><hr><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.
