<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 379 - You Cannot Save Him</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Idiot. Who said that World Spirits can&#x2019;t be separated from the bodies of their masters? If they can&#x2019;t be separated from their masters&#x2019; bodies, then how will World Spirits help their masters? Where would their value be?&#x201D; Eggy fiercely disdained Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then according to what you&#x2019;ve said, World Spirits can be separated from the bodies of the masters, and with their own awareness, enter our world?&#x201D; Chu Feng got more and more happy. He truly, really hoped that Eggy could accompany him with a physical body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It can be done within a reasonable range, and size of this range depends on the strength of the master.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Of course, if you want a World Spirit to leave the Spiritual World, enter your world, and do things with their own awareness, you need to create a&#xA0;gate&#xA0;that links to your Spiritual World and this gate&#xA0;is called the World Spirit Gate.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Naturally, if you want to open the World Spirit Gate, you need to at least grasp the power of blue-coloured Spirit Formations, which also means that you must reach the strength of Blue-cloak World Spiritists.&#x201D; Eggy explained.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Then doesn&#x2019;t that mean in the future, as long as become a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, you can be separated from my Spiritual World and live together with me?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Chu Feng was elated because he knew that Eggy didn&#x2019;t like staying in his Spiritual World. After all, how could such a cheerful and lively little girl like Eggy like being alone? She should like liveliness quite a bit.</span></p><p><span style="">And after hearing those words, Eggy&#x2019;s heart warmed because she understood, in her heart, Chu Feng&#x2019;s intentions. So, she sweetly smiled and said, &#x201C;Yeah, for my freedom, you need to keep it up!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* And just at that time, Zi Ling&#x2019;s Fairy Spirit Formation already finished being laid and it gave off dazzling golden-coloured radiance. The strange thing was that as it was enveloped by the golden-coloured radiance, a gate&#xA0;had actually slowly appeared from the perfect and undamaged wall and it also slowly opened. Zi Ling succeeded.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Girl, not bad!&#x201D; Seeing that, Chu Feng laughed and said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Less speaking, quickly follow.&#x201D; With a thought, Zi Ling reopened a World Spirit Gate&#xA0;and her World Spirit also went back to Zi Ling&#x2019;s Spiritual World on her own.</span></p><p><span style="">After that, Zi Ling speedily walked towards the insides of the wall door and Chu Feng also hurriedly followed.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom*</span></p><p><span style="">Just as Chu Feng and Zi Ling entered, the gate&#xA0;behind them shut and at that instant, Chu Feng discovered that the passageway was a lot more exquisite than the cave outside.</span></p><p><span style="">The walls everywhere there were made by special rocks. On them, beautiful patterns were carved and an indescribable atmosphere appeared. The most important part was that on the wall, Chu Feng felt special Spirit Formation powers, and those powers emanated the auras of Asura.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;The master who created this was also a World Spiritist who was connected with an Asura World Spirit.&#x201D; Eggy said.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is it that Monstrous Beast trapped in the Asura Ghost Tower?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure about that.&#x201D; Eggy shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="">Following the passageway and going forward, their line of sight became more and more broad, and Chu Feng and Zi Ling also discovered some mechanisms. However, those mechanisms were all nullified just now, and without even thinking, they knew that Jiang Wushang did it.</span></p><p><span style="">In a situation like that, Chu Feng and Zi Ling couldn&#x2019;t help but quicken their steps because they were afraid that Jiang Wushang would find the treasures first and if that happened, they were going to lose quite a bit.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Quickly follow.&#x201D; Suddenly, Zi Ling&#x2019;s eyes flashed as if she felt something. She started to use a bodily martial skill and ran with extreme speed in the passageway.</span></p><p><span style="">Without delay, Chu Feng also used the Imperial Wind Technique and quickly followed.</span></p><p><span style="">With such speed, Chu Feng and Zi Ling quickly arrived at the end, and a palace dazzling in gold and jade appeared in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="">That place was truly dazzling in gold and jade because everything there was made out of gold. It emanated the radiance of gold.</span></p><p><span style="">Also, in the middle of the palace, there was a huge area of treasures. All sorts of strange treasures, all sorts of Origin beads and Profound medicines, were piled up into a small mountain.</span></p><p><span style="">Within the little mountain that was caused by piling treasures, there were even several extremely ancient books. They were also placed in the middle, and obviously, they were not Mysterious Techniques. They were martial skills.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haha, they are finally found by me!&#x201D; After seeing those, Zi Ling rejoiced and her beautiful body leaped. As her skirt fluttered, she already flew quickly towards the palace.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Wait!&#x201D; But at that instant, Chu Feng hurriedly yelled to stop her because he astonishedly discovered that in that palace, he didn&#x2019;t see any traces of Jiang Wushang yet that place was clearly the end.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm* Indeed, just as Zi Ling stepped into the palace, the palace had actually twisted and the scene in front of their eyes started to quickly change. It shrunk into a lump and started to wrap around Zi Ling.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, save me!&#x201D; At that very instant, Zi Ling originally wanted to evade it but her efforts were in vain as the twisting scene already wrapped around her, causing her to lose her ability to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What a powerful Illusionary Formation.&#x201D; After that place completely disappeared, the real scene appeared in front of Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">Currently, in front of Chu Feng, how was that even any &#x201C;palace dazzling in gold and jade&#x201D;? It was a quagmire condensed with a dominatingly strong Spirit Formation, and within the quagmire, Zi Ling was quickly sinking and no matter how she struggled, she could not escape her surroundings.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s you?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At the same time, a familiar voice also rang out. It was Jiang Wushang. At that instant, Jiang Wushang was also sank into the quagmire and over half of his body already sank in. After seeing Chu Feng and Zi Ling, his face was filled with shock.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh whoosh whoosh* The current Chu Feng didn&#x2019;t dare to be slow and he hurried laid a Spirit Formation. Quickly after, he sat cross-leggedly, overlaid his palms, then abruptly yelled explosively, &#x201C;Break!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm*</span></p><p><span style="">After speaking those words, within the Spirit Formation that had floating light lingering, two rows of light shot out.</span></p><p><span style="">After that light enveloped Zi Ling and Jiang Wushang, countless symbols, like bugs, started to drill into the quagmire. With that, the sinking speed of Zi Ling and Jiang Wushang had actually slowed down.</span></p><p><span style="">*hualala*</span></p><p><span style="">Quickly after that, the hand seals in front of Chu Feng&#x2019;s chest changed and two Spirit Formation chains condensed by symbols shot out from the Spirit Formation and at the end, coiled around Zi Ling&#x2019;s and Jiang Wushang&#x2019;s body.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Haaa!!!!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After that, Chu Feng yelled explosively again and simultaneously, the palms that he overlaid suddenly tightly clenched and his entire body tensed up. Also, his body started to turn pale-white and droplets of sweat as big as beans never-endingly slid down his face. Boundless Spirit Formation power was unrestrainedly being channeled into the Spirit Formation.</span></p><p><span style="">But luckily, as Chu Feng gave it his all, the Spirit Formation chains also started to retract and Zi Ling and Jiang Wushang who had already sank into the quagmire were slowly rising.</span></p><p><span style="">In that situation, it caused both Zi Ling and Jiang Wushang to be extremely joyed because it meant that Chu Feng&#x2019;s methods were working and Chu Feng could save them.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh*</span></p><p><span style="">Finally, Zi Ling was the first to be pulled out. Without the interference of the illusion, her body was as light as swallow and her original strength returned. With a beautiful angle, she landed in front of Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm*</span></p><p><span style="">But just as she landed, her hand clenched to form a fist, and within her hand, she condensed a Spirit Formation sword out. Quickly after, she sliced down towards the Spirit Formation chain that Chu Feng was using to pull Jiang Wushang up. With a snapping sound, she had actually cut the Spirit Formation chain.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What are you doing?!&#x201D; Seeing that scene, Chu Feng was suddenly shocked and he couldn&#x2019;t help but loudly yell.</span></p><p><span style="">On the other hand, Zi Ling was abnormally calm. After dissipating the Spirit Formation sword in her hand, she lightly rubbed her hand and composedly said, &#x201C;You cannot save him.&#x201D;</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
