<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1419 - The Nine Powers Hunt</strong></p><p>As Su Mei said those words and released that dense killing intent, she appeared to be extremely intimidating. Even Lin Yezhou turned pale and became speechless.</p><p>This was the first time that they had felt Su Mei&#x2019;s killing intent head on. Her killing intent was so frightening that they were unable to resist, and did not dare to look at her straight.</p><p>Right at the moment when the crowd was unable to raise their heads due to being extremely scared by Su Mei&#x2019;s killing intent, Su Mei turned to Chu Feng and said in an extremely gentle manner, &#x201C;Remember, you must come and see me if you have the time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Rest assured, I wouldn&#x2019;t lie to you,&#x201D; As for Chu Feng, he replied with a smile on his face.</p><p>Hearing those words, Su Mei laughed a very bright, sweet and satisfied laugh. Then, she turned around and flew away.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the crowd were all stunned. They were unable to think clearly, as chaos had filled their minds.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on? Could it be that our goddess that we haven&#x2019;t even seen has already become Chu Feng&#x2019;s woman?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No, impossible! This is definitely impossible! She is, after all, Lord Reverend&#x2019;s adopted daughter. With how high her status is, she can look down on everyone. Even Lin Yezhou did not manage to be seen in her eyes, how could she be fond of a mere Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s disciple?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Even if she is willing, Lord Reverend should not be willing.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s definitely some hidden motive. Yes, that&#x2019;s definitely it.&#x201D;</p><p>The crowd was unwilling to accept the truth of Chu Feng and Su Mei being together. They all began to create lies to comfort themselves; they all felt that there was another reason for Chu Feng&#x2019;s promise with Su Mei.</p><p>However, this sort of thinking was something that even they were unable to believe. The suspicion that they were unable to resist caused their hearts to ache as if they were being ripped apart. Especially those men who admired Su Mei. For them, this was simply a fatal blow.</p><p>Right at this time, Lin Yezhou spoke. His tone was extremely arrogant. It was as if he was commanding Chu Feng. As for his gaze, it contained a dense amount of threat and anger. &#x201C;Chu Feng, listen properly. I do not care whether you are an Asura World Spiritist or not. I also do not care what sort of relationship you might have with junior sister Sima. However, get the hell away from my junior sister Lil Mei, for you are not suitable for her.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hah&#x2026;.&#x201D; However, after hearing Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s words, Chu Feng burst into sudden laughter. His laughter was very casual. As for the reason why he laughed, it was because Chu Feng felt this matter to be extremely funny.</p><p>This Lin Yezhou had clearly been fond of Sima Ying before. He had even attacked him because of Sima Ying.</p><p>However, after he turned the target of his pursuit to Lil Mei, he immediately said these sorts of words. This had not only shown that Lin Yezhou was unfaithful and unreasonable, it also displayed that he was a ridiculous person.</p><p>The hidden implication behind the words that he had said earlier was very clear. He was telling Chu Feng that he could have Sima Ying, but he should not think about Lil Mei.</p><p>However, there was clearly nothing going on between Chu Feng and Sima Ying. Yet, Lil Mei was Chu Feng&#x2019;s woman.</p><p>Just thinking about how a mere outsider would act so righteously to tell, to demand that he get away from his own woman, Chu Feng felt that it was truly ridiculous and extremely funny. Thus, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself and started laughing. Furthermore, he was laughing so hard that he was unable to curb his laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;What are you laughing about?&#x201D; Seeing Chu Feng laughing before him, Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s expression grew even uglier. The angry look on his face grew even more pronounced.</p><p>&#x201C;What I&#x2019;m laughing about is none of your concern. Furthermore, let me tell you this too. My matters are none of your business, because you do not possess the qualifications to interfere.&#x201D; After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned around and entered the Dragon Garden.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, remember this, you will not be able to be protected at all times. Even if there is someone protecting you at all times, it does not mean that no one would dare to do anything to you,&#x201D; Lin Yezhou pointed at Chu Feng and shouted loudly.</p><p>&#x201C;Yoh, are you trying to threaten me? I&#x2019;ve received it,&#x201D; Chu Feng merely laughed at Lin Yezhou&#x2019;s words. He was not concerned about him at all. Calmly, Chu Feng walked into the Dragon Garden&#x2019;s palace.</p><p>At this moment, Lin Yezhou was so enraged that he started to tightly clench his fists and gnash his teeth. The veins on his face were all bulging out.</p><p>He was truly enraged. When the two women that he was fond of both refused his love and showed Chu Feng such enormous affection, how could he not be enraged?</p><p>However, other than being angry, there was nothing he could do. Even if he loathed Chu Feng, he did not dare to do anything to Chu Feng here. After all, Chu Feng possessed the protection of Miao Renlong.</p><p>As for the other people, compared to Lin Yezhou who loathed Chu Feng, they were more envious of Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Not bad, you even managed to settle Lord Reverend&#x2019;s adopted daughter.&#x201D;</p><p>Not long after this matter ended, the news of what had happened spread rapidly through the World Spiritist Alliance. After learning of what happened, Sima Ying immediately came to find Chu Feng. With a smile on her face, she started to tease him.</p><p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s merely an ordinary friend,&#x201D; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Ordinary friend? Really?&#x201D; Sima Ying asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course,&#x201D; Chu Feng nodded his head with certainty. However, he did not say anything along the lines of &#x2018;I am definitely not lying to you,&#x2019; to Sima Ying. After all, he was lying to Sima Ying.</p><p>&#x201C;Even if she&#x2019;s only an ordinary friend, you&#x2019;re still amazing. After all, you are the only person in the World Spiritist Alliance who has managed to befriend her.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That junior sister Lil Mei is truly icily arrogant. Even I am unable to reach her level of iciness,&#x201D; Sima Ying said with a beaming smile. Even though Su Mei&#x2019;s appearance had taken her status as the girl blessed by the heavens in the World Spiritist Alliance, Sima Ying did not have any trace of hatred toward Su Mei.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Feng merely laughed a hollow laughter at Sima Ying&#x2019;s words. After all, he knew what sort of person Su Mei was. He knew that she was not an icily arrogant person. At the very least, she was not at all cold or arrogant to him. On the contrary, she was extremely gentle toward him.</p><p>Suddenly, Sima Ying said, &#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s right, I have something serious to talk to you about.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What is it?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t know about the thing that happened in your Cyanwood Mountain?&#x201D; Sima Ying asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Something happened? What is it?&#x201D; Chu Feng asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It seems that you truly don&#x2019;t know. You must know about your Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Remnants, right?&#x201D; Sima Ying asked.</p><p>&#x201C;Ancient Era&#x2019;s Remnants?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart started to beat violently. His gaze immediately turned serious.</p><p>While Chu Feng did not know about what the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Remnants of other places might mean, he knew very well about the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Remnants.</p><p>At that place, not only were there ferocious things from the Ancient Era and countless hidden dangers, there were also a lot of treasures.</p><p>When Chu Feng had joined the Cyanwood Mountain, he had done so precisely for a treasure, a treasure filled with cultivation resources. As for that treasure, it was located in the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Remnants.</p><p>However, due to the fact that the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Remnants were so special, it had become the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s forbidden area. Not to mention Chu Feng, practically no one was allowed to enter.</p><p>&#x201C;Of course I know about the Cyanwood Mountain&#x2019;s Ancient Era&#x2019;s Remnants,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, do you know about the Nine Powers Hunt?&#x201D; Sima Ying asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201D; Chu Feng shook his head. He truly did not know about it.</p><p>&#x201C;Okay. You actually do not know about even that. Well, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. I can tell you what it is.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The Nine Powers Hunt is a coalition pact between the Nine Powers. To put it in simpler terms, the most outstanding disciples of the Nine Powers will be gathered at a dangerous place. After that, they are to conduct a competition to see which of the Nine Power&#x2019;s disciples are the strongest and which are the weakest.</p><p>&#x201C;This Nine Powers Hunt occurs once every three years. As for the hunting location, it is different each time, as each of the Nine Powers will take turns to host the hunt.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;As for this time, the location of the hunt has been provided by the Cyanwood Mountain. Furthermore, the Cyanwood Mountain has already issued the invitation for the hunt.&#x201D;</p><p>As Sima Ying spoke, she took out an invitation letter and handed it to Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
