<p><strong> Chapter 2230 - Exalted&#x2019;s Remnants</strong></p><p>At a certain location on the island.</p><p>Suddenly, five unremarkable bodies of energies flew rapidly through the air. Shortly afterward, they fused together.</p><p>Soon, the five energies turned into the appearance of a man. It was Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;What a close call. If I didn&#x2019;t possess the Five Elements Secret Skill, it would have been difficult for me to escape.&#x201D;</p><p>What Chu Feng said was what he actually felt. Li Rui&#x2019;s battle power was extremely strong; he was not an ordinary opponent. If Chu Feng were to fight him head on, he would definitely be no match for Li Rui.</p><p>However, Chu Feng&#x2019;s Five Elements Secret Skills had bestowed him a special power, an indestructible and unkillable body against those with a similar level of battle power. Even if Chu Feng&#x2019;s body was to be torn to pieces and his bones crushed, he would still not suffer any damage.</p><p>Although Chu Feng might not be able to defeat his opponent, it would also be very difficult for his opponent to kill Chu Feng. For Chu Feng, Li Rui was one such opponent.</p><p>Of course, if Chu Feng&#x2019;s opponent was too strong, if his opponent was many times stronger than him, even if he were to use his Five Elements Secret Skills, he would not be able to escape death.</p><p>When before absolute power, all sorts of techniques became useless.</p><p>&#x201C;This guy, he truly gave a lot of thought to this. He knew that this Queen would be unable to appear here; that is why he dared to attack you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;After we leave this place, let this Queen take care of him,&#x201D; Her Lady Queen said angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need, I will personally take care of that guy,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It would naturally not be difficult for you to handle him. But, you would need to become at least a rank three Half Martial Ancestor. Else&#x2026; it would be very difficult for you to defeat him,&#x201D; Eggy said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s merely rank three Half Martial Ancestor. I might become one without even leaving Mount Cloud Crane. After all, this island is the island where the Exalted trained,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;So, you&#x2019;ve found it?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen revealed an expression of joy.</p><p>&#x201C;Naturally. It is there,&#x201D; Chu Feng pointed to the forest ahead.</p><p>&#x201C;There?&#x201D; Her Lady Queen revealed a skeptical gaze. That forest appeared too ordinary; she was unable to determine anything.</p><p>&#x201C;Inside that forest is the entrance to the cultivation location. However, one must use a special spirit formation in order to make it appear.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Feng spoke, he began to set up his spirit formation. He was not worried about Li Rui catching up to him, because he had made many preparations in his escape. Those preparations he set up would end up affecting Li Rui&#x2019;s judgement, making it impossible for him to find his current location.</p><p>At the moment when Chu Feng was earnestly setting up his spirit formation, he did not know that up in the distant sky and above the white clouds were two gazes that were fixed onto him.</p><p>&#x201C;That spirit formation is truly wondrous. Unfortunately, it is impossible for him to succeed,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve completely sealed off this place, it&#x2019;s naturally impossible for him to remove the seal,&#x201D; The plain clothed old monk said with contempt.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Poisonous Substance, didn&#x2019;t I already say that it wasn&#x2019;t sealed by me, but that Exalted instead?&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said angrily.</p><p>&#x201C;Fine, fine, fine. I got it, okay? In that case, can you not help him undo that seal?&#x201D; The old monk said.</p><p>&#x201C;You think I don&#x2019;t want to help him? The thing is, I cannot undo that seal,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>The old monk did not reply. Instead, he snorted lightly. However, his eyes were revealing a skeptical gaze. He did not believe that the Golden Crane True Immortal was truly unable to undo the seal.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng had finished setting up his spirit formation. Once his grand spirit formation was activated, dazzling light filled the surroundings, seemingly covering that entire forest.</p><p>However, not long after the spirit formation was activated, Chu Feng stopped it. Not only did he stop its activation, he also dispersed the spirit formation.</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong? Could it be that it&#x2019;s not there?&#x201D; Eggy asked in a confused manner.</p><p>&#x201C;No, it is there. That place is the entrance,&#x201D; Chu Feng pointed to a certain place in the forest.</p><p>&#x201C;Then why did you you undo the seal? Why did you disperse your spirit formation?&#x201D; Eggy asked.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t undo the seal; it&#x2019;s too difficult. Not to mention now, even if I am to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, I would still not be able to undo the seal,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s that difficult?&#x201D; Eggy revealed an expression of regret.</p><p>&#x201C;In the end, it&#x2019;s because my strength is insufficient,&#x201D; Chu Feng stood up and began to walk away. He had already given up.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz~~~&#x201D;</p><p>However, right at that moment, strange fluctuations suddenly pulsed from behind him.</p><p>Chu Feng turned around to look. Immediately, his pupils shrunk and his expression changed enormously. Shock filled his eyes.</p><p>He was shocked to discover that a world spirit gate had opened. As for that world spirit gate, it was&#x2026; precisely the entrance to the place where that Exalted had trained in.</p><p>&#x201C;You, you&#x2019;ve clearly undone the seal. Yet, you actually deceived this Queen. You are truly unruly. Watch how this Queen will take care of you later,&#x201D; Upon seeing that world spirit gate, Eggy was extremely happy. Even though she was blaming Chu Feng, she had an extremely enchanting smile.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2026; this was not unsealed by me,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;What? It&#x2019;s wasn&apos;t unsealed by you?&#x201D; Eggy was also very shocked.</p><p>&#x201C;It really wasn&apos;t unsealed by me. The reason for that is because it is simply impossible for me to undo the seal. Thus, evidently, it has opened by itself,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah?&#x201D; Eggy became even more shocked.</p><p>At that moment, above the clouds, the old monk also revealed an elated expression. He walked over to the Golden Crane True Immortal and patted his shoulder. &#x201C;Golden Crane, you have a sharp tongue but a soft heart, eh? Didn&apos;t you say that you were not going to help? Turns out, you still helped.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;But, you are neither a relative nor a friend to him, so why did you help him? Say, could it be that you still want to take him as a disciple?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t me,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p><p>&#x201C;What did you say?&#x201D; The old monk asked.</p><p>&#x201C;It opened by itself,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal replied.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D; Hearing those words, the expression of the old monk turned serious. He stared carefully at that world spirit gate. It was as if he was seeing through everything inside the world spirit gate.</p><p>&#x201C;There are no dangers inside. Did you truly not open it?&#x201D; The old monk asked again.</p><p>&#x201C;Why would I deceive you? It&#x2019;s truly not me,&#x201D; The Golden Crane True Immortal said in an annoyed manner.</p><p>&#x201C;In that case, things are even more interesting,&#x201D; A faint smiling expression appeared in the old monk&#x2019;s serious gaze.</p><p>If it wasn&#x2019;t the Golden Crane True Immortal, that would mean that the seal was undone by the legendary Exalted.</p><p>Even if it wasn&#x2019;t personally undone by the Exalted, it would mean that Chu Feng had done something that satisfied the mechanism left behind by the Exalted, and caused the world spirit gate to open.</p><p>In other words, Chu Feng had obtained the acknowledgement of that Exalted, and received the opportunity to enter that place.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng had already entered the world spirit gate.</p><p>After passing through the world spirit gate, Chu Feng&#x2019;s eyes were opened to a new sight.</p><p>It&#x2026; was another world.</p><p>He was standing on the summit of a cliff. As far as the eye could see, extremely beautiful painting-like scenery filled the world.</p><p>Most importantly, after Chu Feng entered that place, he felt a sensation that he had never felt before. It was as if there were many mysteries hidden in that world. He felt that if he could comprehend those mysteries, he would be able to obtain a whole new understanding toward the path of martial cultivation, allowing for easier breakthroughs of the cultivation bottlenecks.</p><p>&#x201C;Wow! There are so many Natural Oddities. Chu Feng, you&#x2019;ve struck rich!&#x201D; At that moment, Eggy was unable to stop herself from cheering.</p><p>The reason for that was because there was a stone wall above the cliff. Although the stone wall was made of stone, it was constructed in a framework of shelves. The shelves were filled with all different kinds of unusual artworks.</p><p>However, all of the artworks were constructed from Natural Oddities that contained a dense amount of Natural Energy.</p><p>Most shockingly, the stone wall was enormous, and contained a very large amount of Natural Oddities - they were in the several thousands.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
