<p><strong> Chapter 1993 - Telling The Truth</strong></p><p>The battle in the Moonlight Maze ended with the Dark Hall&#x2019;s crushing defeat. Everyone present knew that the crucial person that had turned the battle around was not the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves&#x2019; Lord Luokong, Rather, it was Chu Feng.</p><p>Even though this battle had ended in Chu Feng&#x2019;s victory, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves did not dare to relax. They immediately returned to the Elf Kingdom. After all, the Dark Hall could be said to be completely at war against the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves right now.</p><p>Thus, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves had to return as quickly as possible. Likely, they would have no time to rest after their return. Instead, they would have to battle against the Dark Hall again.</p><p>However, the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves were not the first to leave. The first one to leave was Wang Qiang. Wang Qiang had slipped away without anyone noticing. He did not even bother to bid farewell to anyone.</p><p>After the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves left, the various human and monstrous beast experts also began to leave in succession. Those that were planning to join the Cyanwood Mountain left directly for the Cyanwood Mountain. As for the others, they too left this dangerous location as quickly as possible.</p><p>After this event, they had experienced how powerful the Dark Hall was. They were also afraid that reinforcements from the Dark Hall would arrive. As such, they decided to leave the Moonlight Maze as quickly as possible.</p><p>Just as the crowd were all leaving, a somewhat timid voice sounded. &#x201C;Y-Young hero Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>Turning toward the source of the voice, Chu Feng discovered that it was a Ximen Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder. It was not only him; there were also Utmost Exalted Elders from the Nangong Imperial Clan, the Beitang Imperial Clan and the Dongfang Imperial Clan.</p><p>Originally, they had come to the Moonlight Maze to search for treasures while representing their respective Imperial Clans. Like the others, they had failed to obtain any treasures, and nearly died in the area with the Immortality Peach Tree. They had been saved by Chu Feng, and then later accompanied the crowd to this place to fight against the people from the Dark Hall.</p><p>Originally, it was only natural for them to do these things, as they were grateful after being saved by Chu Feng. After the battle was over, they should be happy.</p><p>However, at that moment, other than the Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder, the Utmost Exalted Elders from the other three Imperial Clans all possessed somewhat of an abnormal expression on their faces. To put it simply, they were scared.</p><p>The reason for that was because they had experienced for themselves how powerful Chu Feng was today.</p><p>Back then, they had been high and above, and had not placed Chu Feng in their eyes. They felt that they were capable of drowning Chu Feng, a nobody, with only a mouthful of spit.</p><p>However, looking back now, they discovered how foolish they had been before. With Chu Feng&#x2019;s current strength, he was already someone who could completely erase their Four Great Imperial Clans by himself. They would be lying if they declared that they were not afraid of Chu Feng. They were truly afraid that Chu Feng would retaliate against them.</p><p>Chu Feng knew what these Utmost Exalted Elders were thinking. Thus, he smiled and said, &#x201C;Seniors, there&#x2019;s no need to mention things from the past again. Right now, we only have a single enemy, the Dark Hall. As for us, we are allies.&#x201D;</p><p>The Nangong Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elder said, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng is truly a great person of great stature. Back then, this old man was truly blind and narrow-minded. I...&#x201D; he sighed, &#x201C;I am truly ashamed.&#x201D; He revealed an ashamed expression on his face.</p><p>The other three Great Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders revealed the same sort of expression. They had merely reconciled with Chu Feng before because they had been forced to by Nangong Longjian. As such, they did not feel that they had wronged Chu Feng.</p><p>But now, Chu Feng clearly possessed the strength to erase their entire clans. Yet, Chu Feng was standing before them in such a calm manner. Not only was he not hostile toward them, he instead treated them as his allies.</p><p>Chu Feng&#x2019;s actions had won them over completely. As such, they were unable to help themselves from feeling ashamed of their previous actions.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, you all should return quickly. The Dark Hall is vicious and merciless. I think it is best for you all to be on guard against them,&#x201D; ChU Feng said with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Thank you, little friend Chu Feng, for your warning. In that case, we will take our leave,&#x201D; After hearing what Chu Feng said, the Utmost Exalted Elders came to a sudden realization.</p><p>Today, they had gone against the Dark Hall. If the Dark Hall was unwilling to let things go, they would most likely attack them. As such, they had to be on guard against the Dark Hall&#x2019;s attack. At least, they had to make sure that their clansmen were safe.</p><p>As the Dark Hall was powerful enough to contend against the Ancient Era&#x2019;s Elves, it would absolutely not be a small matter should they attack them. Thus, they needed to immediately return to their respective Imperial Clans first.</p><p>After the Four Great Imperial Clan&#x2019;s Utmost Exalted Elders left, only Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal remained.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, you are truly a person of great stature. With how broad-minded you are, this old man has truly not misjudged you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, even with this being the case, the speed of your growth still has me taken aback,&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal walked toward Chu Feng with a smile on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, you are flattering me. This junior is even blushing now,&#x201D; Chu Feng pretended to be embarrassed and covered his face. As Chu Feng was an old acquaintance of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Chu Feng did not act reserved toward him.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh, you. You&#x2019;re clearly one of the peak experts of the Holy Land of Martialism. Yet, you&#x2019;re still acting this haughty? If those girls who worship you were to hear of this, I truly do not know how they would react,&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal laughed.</p><p>He began to recall the first time he met Chu Feng. At that time, Chu Feng had been so small and weak. Countless people in the Holy Land of Martialism would have been able to kill him.</p><p>However, Chu Feng had now not only become a grand character known by everyone in the Holy Land of Martialism, he also possessed the strength of a peak expert.</p><p>From Chu Feng&#x2019;s techniques earlier, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal knew that Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques had already surpassed his own. With Chu Feng&#x2019;s world spirit techniques, it would not be impossible for Chu Feng to refine an Imperial Armament.</p><p>As for martial cultivation, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal knew that Chu Feng would soon surpass him.</p><p>This era was an era with countless geniuses rising from the younger generation. If an overlord were to truly emerge from among them, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal felt that it would definitely be Chu Feng.</p><p>Suddenly, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&#x2019;s expression turned unnatural. &#x201C;Chu Feng, there is one matter that I wish to ask you about. It is merely a casual question of mine. You do not have to overthink it.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, might you be wanting to ask about Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s death?&#x201D; Chu Feng managed to guess what the Weaponry Refinement Immortal wanted to ask from his expression.</p><p>&#x201C;Precisely,&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal hesitated for a moment before nodding. He asked, &#x201C;Did you kill him?&#x201D; When he asked that question, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&#x2019;s eyes were fixed onto Chu Feng&#x2019;s the entire time. Even though he did not have any hostility in his eyes, he longed for the truth.</p><p>At that moment, Chu Feng&#x2019;s heart felt extremely complicated. In the end, he decided to not conceal anything, and to tell the Weaponry Refinement Immortal the truth. &#x201C;Baili Xinghe was not killed by me. However, his death is related to me. Senior, I&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>Chu Feng wanted to apologize. Even though he did not feel that causing Baili Xinghe&#x2019;s death was wrong, he still felt guilt toward the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. Chu Feng was able to tell that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal possessed a very deep affection for his disciple Baili Xinghe.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, thank you. This old man feels very relieved that you were able to tell me the truth.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, you absolutely must not apologize,&#x201D; Before Chu Feng could apologize, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal interrupted him. He continued, &#x201C;I actually knew very well what sort of character that disciple of mine had. He was fond of Zi Ling and Su Rou, and had bothered them repeatedly, only to be rejected in the end. From these repeated rejections, he started to detest you. I knew about all that.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Thus, even if his death is related to you, I know that it was definitely not your fault.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, if I may speak frankly, Baili Xinghe sought for his death himself,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. Thus, I have gotten over it, and decided to not avenge his death,&#x201D; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p><p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng knew that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal possessed the desire to avenge Baili Xinghe. However, he was struggling in his heart. As for Chu Feng, he did not know what to tell the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.</p><p>Chu Feng actually did not wish for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to avenge scum like Baili Xinghe. This was especially true because the Weaponry Refinement Immortal would have to kill Leng Yue to avenge Baili Xinghe. As for Leng Yue, she was the number one disciple of the Heavenly Law Palace. The Heavenly Law Palace was nurturing her as if she would be their future pillar. As such, if the Weaponry Refinement Immortal were to kill Leng Yue, the Heavenly Law Palace would definitely not leave the matter at that.</p><p>Truly, the gains would not make up for the losses.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
