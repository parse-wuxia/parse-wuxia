<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 10 &#x2013; Failing to Honor&#xA0;a Debt</strong></p><p>At that instant, the hall went into complete silence and all the gazes were cast towards Chu Yue.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Yue, what did you say? You cannot speak such nonsense to testify.&#x201D;</p><p>As Chu Wei said that, his dense gaze was filled with implications of warning. His meaning was very clear and it was to make Chu Yue say the truth.</p><p>&#x201C;I am not speaking nonsense. That day, when Chu Zhen and Chu Feng made the bet, I was there and it was even Chu Zhen who let me be a witness.&#x201D;</p><p>After that, Chu Yue was not afraid of Chu Wei at all. She stood next to Chu Feng, as if hiddenly telling the crowd which side she was standing on.</p><p>At that moment, not only Chu Zhen, even Chu Cheng, Chu Wei and most of the Chu family&#x2019;s faces were starting to change.</p><p>They never would have thought that Chu Yue would do this for Chu Feng and she was even willing to go against the entire Chu family crowd.</p><p>In reality, even Chu Feng felt a bit surprised since by doing this, Chu Yue would offend a lot of people. But other than that, Chu Feng felt moved.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Zhen, are you failing to honor&#xA0;your debt?&#x201D; Chu Feng continued to pressure him. With Chu Yue as a witness, he did not believe that Chu Zhen would deny it.</p><p>&#x2018;&#x201D;I&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Zhen&#x2019;s face was extremely ugly and he did not know how to reply.</p><p>Every year, the family only supplemented one Saint Spirit Grass. Other than the one, they did not have any other chances to get such a good spiritual medicine.</p><p>He just got his supplemented Saint Spirit Grass and Chu Zhen was preparing to use it to make a breakthrough into the 4th level of the Spirit realm. How could he give it up to someone?</p><p>&#x201C;Hmph, so what if it&#x2019;s true?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You entered the Azure Dragon School at the same time as Chu Zhen. He already entered the inner court two years ago and&#xA0;you are a full two years late.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What, after using that much time to enter the inner court, you&#x2019;re still arrogant? You want to extort Chu Zhen&#x2019;s supplement?&#x201D; Chu Cheng coldly smiled and cunningly argued. As Chu Zhen&#x2019;s elder brother, it was obvious that he wouldn&#x2019;t let Chu Feng take away his brother&#x2019;s supplement.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t tell me that. Your brother should know what is happening.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you are failing to honor&#xA0;your debt, just admit it. I can&#xA0;forget about it. But you need him to personally admit that his words are like fart and they are absolutely untrustable.&#x201D; Chu Feng did not let him go.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2026;&#x201D; With those words, Chu Zhen was really gnashing his teeth out of anger yet he could not refute him since it was true.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha! Jokes! Failing to honor&#xA0;a debt? Have I ever mentioned anything about that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You can have Chu Zhen&#x2019;s Saint Spirit Grass, but you need to admit in front of the crowd that you are a useless garbage. An idiot that needed five years to enter the inner court.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone, am I correct?&#x201D; Chu Cheng yelled loudly.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, Chu Cheng is right.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s right, if you want to take the Saint Spirit Grass, you need to admit that you are garbage. As long as you admit it, then we&#x2019;ll just give it as pity to a beggar.&#x201D; Chu Cheng raised his hands and yelled, and naturally, everyone yelled in response.</p><p>In the Chu family, excluding&#xA0;Chu Yuan, Chu Guyu and Chu Yue, pretty much no one liked Chu Feng and they all wanted him out of the Chu family.</p><p>So no matter how excessive it was, as long as it was related to Chu Feng, they would support it. They all wanted Chu Feng to feel horrible.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Cheng, don&#x2019;t create trouble without a reason. This is a private matter between Chu Zhen and Chu Feng so all of you are not qualified to interrupt.&#x201D; Chu Yue scolded.</p><p>&#x201C;We are not qualified, yet you are? You are the elder sister of Chu Zhen, but even so,&#xA0;you supported an outsider. Are you still even part of the Chu family?&#x201D; Chu Cheng maliciously and fiercely refuted.</p><p>&#x201C;I only look at the case and not the person. In any case, Chu Feng is not an outsider. He is part of the Chu family.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You clearly know whether or not he is part of the Chu family. However, I can tell you that Chu Zhen is your own brother.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t even bother to reason!&#x201D; Chu Yue was so angered by Chu Cheng that her entire body was trembling.</p><p>But just at that time, Chu Feng put his hands on Chu Yue shoulders, and moved&#xA0;her behind him.</p><p>Although the current Chu Feng had the same smile as always on his face, his gaze became serious and he said calmly,</p><p>&#x201C;I will only ask you one question. Will&#xA0;you give this Saint Spirit Grass to me or no?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Ho.. Chu Feng, don&#x2019;t say that we are making things hard for you, but you really are not qualified to take Chu Zhen&#x2019;s Saint Spirit Grass.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How about this&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll give you a chance. Duel a bit with Chu Zhen. If you win, that shows that you are qualified to take away this Saint Spirit Grass.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Yue, don&#x2019;t say that I&#x2019;m not speaking reason. I&#x2019;ll even take my own Saint Spirit Grass out. If Chu Feng can win, then these are&#xA0;all his.&#x201D; While saying that, Chu Cheng put the Saint Spirit Grass from his pocket onto the table.</p><p>Also at the same time, Chu Cheng shot a glance at Chu Zhen. Chu Zhen instantly understood and he also put his Saint Spirit Grass onto the table.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Zhen, you&#x2019;ve entered the inner court for two years, and you&#x2019;ve also cultivated two skills.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;On the other hand,&#xA0;Chu Feng just entered the inner court. Don&#x2019;t you feel ashamed dueling with him? You just aren&#x2019;t willing to give it up.&#x201D; Chu Yue still felt that it was unfair towards Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Shut up. You don&#x2019;t have any part in this.&#x201D; Chu Cheng threateningly pointed at Chu Yue, then narrowed his eyes and looked at Chu Feng,</p><p>&#x201C;But, if you lose, bring your Saint Spirit Grass out. Do you dare?&#x201D;</p><p>At that instant, all the eyes landed on Chu Feng and they were waiting for his reply.</p><p>If Chu Feng refused, they could humiliate Chu Feng and say that he was a coward. If Chu Feng agreed, Chu Zhen could openly give Chu Feng a lesson.</p><p>No matter what, Chu Feng was in a dangerous spot. They only wanted to see how Chu Feng would be humiliated.</p><p>&#x201C;Why wouldn&#x2019;t I dare?&#x201D; Chu Feng smiled and agreed.</p><p>&#x201C;Good, you have the guts. But let&#x2019;s say this first. Fists and kicks don&#x2019;t have eyes, so you cannot complain about any injuries.&#x201D; Chu Cheng&#x2019;s smile became even more despicable.</p><p>&#x201C;Enough with the rubbish. Come at me.&#x201D; Chu Feng put his own Saint Spirit Grass on the table, then walked to the middle of the hall.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng&#x2026;&#x201D; Chu Yue pulled on Chu Feng, and those flickering eyes were urging him not to duel with Chu Zhen.</p><p>But Chu Feng pushed away Chu Yue&#x2019;s hands with a smile and said, &#x201C;Trust me.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that, Chu Yue couldn&#x2019;t help but have a blank look. For some reason, she had a feeling that Chu Feng would undoubtedly win this round.</p><p>Chu Feng and Chu Zhen walked towards&#xA0;the middle of the hall and everyone&#xA0;surrounded them. They didn&#x2019;t want to miss out on Chu Feng&#x2019;s humiliation.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, it seems that you want the riches but not your life.&#x201D;</p><p>The Chu Zhen that hadn&#x2019;t spoke in a long time finally had a smile on his face, but his smile was very evil.</p><p>Being forced into the embarrassing situation by Chu Feng made him very unhappy. Since he had a chance to teach Chu Feng a lesson, obviously, he wouldn&#x2019;t restrain himself.</p><p>&#x201C;Hoho.&#x201D; Chu Feng lightly smiled then said, &#x201C;I just wanted to say those words to you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You talk too big. Today, I&#x2019;ll let you know how weak you are.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Zhen&#x2019;s left feet stepped forward. One&#xA0;could only hear a boom before his entire body ran with flying speed.</p><p>Both his arms were moving and his punches were flying everywhere. Powerful aura came from his body and he was like a wild Fierce Beast as he headed towards Chu Feng.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
