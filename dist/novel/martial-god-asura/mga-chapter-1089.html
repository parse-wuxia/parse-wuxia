<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1089 - The Ascension Sect&#x2019;s Contempt</strong></p><p>Although the Ascension Sect was also located in the Cyanwood Domain, it was not located in the north as opposed to the south. Thus, it was very far away from the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p><p>Adding on the fact that the Holy Land of Martialism was an enormous place, even though there were ancient teleportation formations, it still took Chu Feng and Sikong Zhaixing several days to arrive at the Ascension Sect.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Feng and Sikong Zhaixing had finally entered the territory of the Ascension Sect.</p><p>It had a very imposing yet majestic power. The location where the Ascension Sect was set up was in the Ascension Mountain Range.</p><p>The Ascension Mountain Range was a very vast and beautiful mountain range. It possessed mountains that pierced into the clouds and very long and unending waterfalls. Most importantly, there was a special kind of bird in this Ascension Mountain Range called the Ascension Bird.</p><p>An adult Ascension Bird was able to grow up to ten meters tall. They were not monstrous beasts and could only be considered to be ordinary birds. But they possessed extreme speed and were domesticated as mounts by the Ascension Sect. Therefore, they were considered to be the distinct feature of the Ascension Sect.</p><p>At this moment, high up above the continuous mountain range were numerous elegant palaces as far as the eyes could see. Adding on the Ascension Birds that would occasionally fly past them and the vast white clouds that floated above the palaces, this Ascension Sect appeared like a world of immortals from a single glance.</p><p>In fact, to ordinary people, the Ascension Sect was simply a land of immortals. As for those people that could train in there, they were all immortals that possessed remarkable abilities.</p><p>Although the Ascension Sect possessed a promise with the Southern Cyanwood Forest, it never had any interaction with the Southern Cyanwood Forest in all these years. However, because Sikong Zhaixing was the headmaster of the Southern Cyanwood Forest and possessed the cultivation of a Half Martial Emperor, when they arrived at the Ascension Sect, the elders there greeted them courteously.</p><p>&#x201C;Headmaster Sikong, ever since you had visited our Ascension Sect seventy-eight years ago, this is the second time that you&#x2019;ve come to our Ascension Sect. You truly are an infrequent visitor.&#x201D;</p><p>The person who received Sikong Zhaixing and Chu Feng was a management elder. Although he was only a management elder, he also possessed the cultivation of a Half Martial Emperor. Adding on the fact that his status in the Ascension Sect was very high, he did not treat Sikong Zhaixing with a great amount of reverence. Instead, he treated Sikong Zhaixing amiably as someone standing on equal footing.</p><p>&#x201C;Ah, Elder Zhou, your memory is truly excellent. At that time, Elder Zhou was only a Martial Lord. Yet now, you&#x2019;re already a Half Martial Emperor. This sort of progress truly causes this old one to blush with shame.&#x201D; Sikong Zhaixing bitterly laughed in a slightly self-mocking manner.</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true. At that time, I was merely a lowly disciple. And now, I have managed to become a management elder. However, it is all thanks to the cultivation from our Ascension Sect. Otherwise, it would be impossible for me to obtain my current accomplishments.&#x201D; Said Elder Zhou in a slightly proud manner.</p><p>&#x201C;Although that might be the case, it still required for Elder Zhou to possess exceptional talent. Otherwise, no matter how much they put forth to cultivate you, it would still be impossible for you to reach the Half Martial Emperor level.&#x201D; Sikong Zhaixing continued to complement Elder Zhou.</p><p>&#x201C;What Headmaster Sikong said is true too. Of my generation&#x2019;s disciples, I am indeed the one that&#x2019;s the most outstanding.&#x201D; Being praised by Sikong Zhaixing in such a manner, the complacent expression on Elder Zhou&#x2019;s face became even more pronounced. As for his attitude toward Sikong Zhaixing, it also became a lot friendlier. He even took the initiative to ask.</p><p>&#x201C;Headmaster Sikong, I know for sure that you&#x2019;re a person that doesn&#x2019;t visit a place without a cause. May I know what brought you to our Ascension Sect today?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If there&#x2019;s something you need, just tell me. Although I am only a management elder right now, I could still be considered to possess some strength. If there&#x2019;s anything that I could help with, I definitely will.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Since Elder Zhou said it like this, then I shall not beat around the bush either. Actually, the reason I&#x2019;ve come here today is for the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda.&#x201D; Sikong Zhaixing did not bother to keep Elder Zhou in suspense; he directly mentioned his purpose in coming.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? The Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda?&#x201D; Hearing those words, Elder Zhou&#x2019;s eyes flashed. He then said, &#x201C;If my memory is correct, Headmaster Sikong had come to our Ascension Sect last time for the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda too.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, it seemed that the disciple you had brought with you that time had failed. Do you plan to have this disciple try this time around?&#x201D; Evidently, Elder Zhou knew about the meaning behind the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda. Thus, he cast his gaze toward Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh? Rank one Martial King. He is indeed much more outstanding than the disciple you brought with you back then. At the very least, his age is much younger.&#x201D; Upon inspecting Chu Feng, Elder Zhou displayed a slightly surprised expression in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201C;We have indeed come for the purpose of the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda. Might Elder Zhou be able to&#x2026;&#x201D; Headmaster Sikong appeared to be somewhat reserved. Although the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda was something the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s ancestor had left behind, it was, after all, situated in the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s territory right now. If the Ascension Sect was to refuse to allow them to enter, there would be nothing that he could do. Thus, the current Sikong Zhaixing was truly using a pleading-for-a-favor kind of tone and lowered his tone by three degrees.</p><p>&#x201C;My, Headmaster Sikong, what sort of words are those? Although I am only a management elder, I still know about the promise between our ancestors. Headmaster Sikong, please follow me.&#x201D; Elder Zhou smiled and then turned around to lead the way.</p><p>Seeing that Elder Zhou decided to help, Headmaster Sikong heaved a sigh of relief. He then sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng. &#x201C;Chu Feng, the Ascension Sect is different from the Orion Monastery. Although this matter is a promise that our ancestors have set up, it remains that we have come to ask for a favor of them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Adding on how many years have passed. It is also not the first time that our Southern Cyanwood Forest has brought people here for the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda. Yet, till this date, no one was able to obtain the keepsake from the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda. Thus, it would be normal for the Ascension Sect to look down upon us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Unless you&#x2019;re able to obtain the keepsake, they would forever look down upon us. Thus&#x2026; if they were to make things difficult for us later, that would also be normal. We&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Sikong, this junior understands. When standing below eaves, one has no choice but to lower one&#x2019;s head. This junior knows when to endure when he should. However, at times when I should not endure, this junior definitely won&#x2019;t. I have both a baseline and my own honor.&#x201D; Chu Feng knew what Sikong Zhaixing wanted to tell him &#x2014; he wanted to have him contain his temperament.</p><p>&#x201C;Mn.&#x201D; Hearing Chu Feng&#x2019;s response, Sikong Zhaixing did not bother to say anything else.</p><p>Under the guidance of Elder Zhou, Chu Feng finally saw the so-called Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda. It was a very ordinary ancient pagoda. At the very least, when looking from the surface, it appeared to be very ordinary. However, Chu Feng knew that this ancient pagoda was very extraordinary; it was a very enormous and powerful formation that contained a very formidable power.</p><p>Moreover, at this time, the enormous formation was already being utilized by someone, causing an enormous formation to be extended out from the ancient pagoda.</p><p>At this moment, there were ninety-nine formation cores on top of that enormous formation. Those formation cores were able to acquire the energy from within the ancient pagoda. After being refined by the enormous formation, the energy derived from the ancient pagoda could be used to temper and train the body.</p><p>At this moment, within the ninety-nine formation cores sat ninety-nine youngsters.</p><p>There were both males and females amongst this group of youngsters. All of them possessed very powerful strength, being practically all Martial Kings. Three among them even possessed the cultivation of rank three Martial King. Without even thinking, Chu Feng knew that these ought to be the core disciples of the Ascension Sect. Judging from their quality, they seemed to be a bit stronger than the Orion Monastery&#x2019;s disciples.</p><p>It was evident that the Ascension Sect was using the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda constructed by Headmaster Baili to train and develop their disciples.</p><p>However, this was something that Chu Feng could tolerate. After all, the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda was set up within the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s territory. As it contained such powerful energy within it, it was pardonable for the Ascension Sect to try to make use of it.</p><p>However, what he could not tolerate was that the door to the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda was left wide open. This meant that not only did the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s people use the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda to train, they could even enter and leave the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda as they wished.</p><p>This sort of behavior was disrespectful to the Southern Cyanwood Forest. It was truly a bit excessive.</p><p>However, upon considering their current situation, Chu Feng decided to endure it and did not say much about it. Instead, he cast his gaze to Sikong Zhaixing.</p><p>When he looked to Sikong Zhaixing, he discovered that Sikong Zhaixing&#x2019;s expression was also unsightly. Moreover, Chu Feng was able to tell that the formation was created not too long ago. Thus, the Southern Cyanwood Forest&#x2019;s Pagoda being used by the Ascension Sect&#x2019;s disciples to train was clearly something that Sikong Zhaixing didn&#x2019;t know either.</p><p>However, at this moment, that Elder Zhou completely disregarded the feelings of Chu Feng and Sikong Zhaixing. With a very indifferent tone, he said, &#x201C;Oh, I almost forgot. This time is the training time for our Ascension Sect&#x2019;s core disciples. Please wait a moment longer.&#x201D;</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
