<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1387 - Aged Palm</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Buzz.&#x201D;</p><p>With the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter in his hand, Old Village Chief Ma&#x2019;s might was greatly increased. In an instant, the golden shield formed by his world spirit technique emitted much stronger radiance, akin to the bright sunshine itself. The light was so piercingly bright that the crowd found it extremely difficult to open their eyes.</p><p>In this sort of situation, the cracks that had previously covered this golden shield were all restored in an instant. Furthermore, the might of the shield itself also increased greatly.</p><p>After the might of the golden shield was increased, that previously unstoppable Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear was stopped by the Golden Shield once again. In a stalemate, the two techniques stopped in midair. The outcome of the battle between them was difficult to determine.</p><p>&#x201C;As expected from Lord Village Chief. With the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter in hand, his might is unparalleled!&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, Lord Village Chief is truly amazing. Using only world spirit techniques, he managed to stop the legendary Ancient Era&#x2019;s martial skill, Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear. This has truly broadened our horizons!&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing Old Village Chief Ma&#x2019;s world spirit technique becoming more powerful through the use of the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter, the villagers of the Sealing Ancient Village that had previously been in despair were now overjoyed and cheering loudly while waving their arms around.</p><p>To them, the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear was an unparalleled martial skill. However, at this very moment, Old Village Chief Ma had blocked this unparalleled martial skill. This, in turn, meant that their Lord Village Chief was even more unparalleled.</p><p>&#x201C;Humph, Old Ma, you possess the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter that is capable of increasing the power of your world spirit techniques, but does that mean that I, Sun Feiyang, would not possess a weapon that would increase my martial power?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at the moment when all of the villagers thought that Old Village Chief Ma would definitely win, at the moment when they were all feeling complacent, Sun Feiyang flipped his palm. Then, an enormous ax that shone with golden light, measuring ten meters long with a dragon and a phoenix carved on it, appeared in Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>It was a Royal Armament, an extremely powerful, extremely high quality Royal Armament that was practically not inferior to Chu Feng&#x2019;s Royal Armament. Most importantly, being used by Sun Feiyang, this top quality Royal Armament was capable of displaying the pinnacle of its might.</p><p>Sure enough, after this top quality Royal Armament appeared, Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s battle power instantly soared.</p><p>Sun Feiyang began to form hand seals with one hand. With his other hand, he grabbed onto the Royal Armament ax and pointed it at Old Village Chief Ma. Then, a golden ray of light shot out explosively from his Royal Armament ax and infused the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear.</p><p>&#x201C;Buzz.&#x201D; The golden ray of light fused with the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear, causing the might of the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear to greatly increase. &#x201C;Boom!&#x201D; Following a loud explosion, golden energy ripples began to wreak havoc throughout the region. The Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear had managed to break through Old Village Chief Ma&#x2019;s golden shield.</p><p>Furthermore, the remaining might of the golden spear was also extremely strong. At this moment, it was rushing explosively toward Old Village Chief Ma.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh.&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that the situation had turned bad, Old Village Chief Ma did not dare to be careless. As he retreated, he began to set up multiple spirit formations in succession with the help of the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter.</p><p>Unfortunately, as there was not enough time, the spirit formations that he set up were not powerful enough. Even though they managed to cancel out a lot of the remaining power of the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear, they were all pierced through and destroyed by the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear. None of them were capable of withstanding the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear.</p><p>&#x201C;Boom~~~~~~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Following a loud explosion, the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear landed on Old Village Chief Ma&#x2019;s body. Although Old Village Chief Ma managed to stop the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear from piercing through his body with the spirit formation barrier that had protected his body, he was still knocked flying into the crowd.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Village Chief!&#x201D; Seeing this scene, the crowd from the Sealing Ancient Village were all frightened. At this moment, the injuries that Old Village Chief Ma received were no small matter. His entire body was covered with blood. His body had been completely mutilated beyond recognition.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201D; However, at the moment when everyone was worried about Old Village Chief Ma&#x2019;s safety, Old Village Chief Ma casually waved his hand and forced himself back up.</p><p>&#x201C;Wuuwaa.&#x201D; However, the injuries that he had received were truly too serious. Right after he stood up, a mouthful of blood rushed out of his mouth.</p><p>However, even though this was the case, he still forced himself to walk toward Chu Feng, standing in front of him, shielding him. He was still determined to protect Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Ma,&#x201D; Seeing Old Village Chief Ma still wanting to protect him even with his current state of health, Chu Feng felt very complicated. He was both moved and saddened.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend, rest assured. I, Ma, am still able to persist,&#x201D; Old Village Chief Ma smiled as he waved his hand at Chu Feng to indicate to him to be at ease.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Ma, why continue? You should know that I was lenient with you earlier. Else, with the might of the Earthen Taboo: Golden Spear, it would be impossible for you to continue standing now,&#x201D; Sun Feiyang said coldly.</p><p>&#x201C;Heh. Sun Feiyang, if you wish to harm little friend Chu Feng, you must do so over my dead body,&#x201D; Old Village Chief Ma&#x2019;s voice was extremely frail. However, his tone was very unyielding.</p><p>&#x201C;Old Ma, do you truly believe that I will not dare to kill you?&#x201D; Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. A gloomy and cold smile emerged on his face.</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone will die eventually. I, Ma, have never been one to fear death,&#x201D; Old Village Chief Ma laughed. With a calm expression on his face, he faced death with laughter.</p><p>&#x201C;Good courage. To tell the truth, for a brat like him, there is truly no reason for me to kill you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s because if I wish to kill him, the current you is simply unable to stop me,&#x201D; As Sun Feiyang spoke, his body shifted and disappeared. When he reappeared, he had bypassed Old Village Chief Ma and was standing before Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;With me here, don&#x2019;t you think you can harm him!&#x201D; However, it seemed that Old Village Chief Ma had already anticipated this scene. With a thought, a world spirit formation appeared and trapped Sun Feiyang within it. He was trying to restrict Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s movements.</p><p>&#x201C;Do you think that the current you is still capable of stopping me?&#x201D;</p><p>However, facing the world spirit cage, Sun Feiyang was not the least bit afraid. He waved his sleeve and, as Emperor level martial power surged out to wreak havoc, easily shattered the world spirit cage. At the same time, he knocked Old Village Chief Ma flying several thousand meters away. Powerless, Old Village Chief Ma fell to the ground.</p><p>&#x201C;Lord Village Chief!&#x201D; Seeing that, the villagers of the Sealing Ancient Village swarm to Old Village Chief Ma in a hurry.</p><p>In an instant, no one bothered to pay attention to Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&#x2019;s safety.</p><p>As for Chu Feng, he too was worried about Old Village Chief Ma&#x2019;s safety. He forgot that Sun Feiyang was before him, and even wanted to rush to Old Village Chief Ma to help heal his injuries.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu, Chu Feng, qu, quickly, ru, run away. Do you no, not want to, to live anymore?&#x201D; Seeing this, Wang Qiang immediately grabbed onto Chu Feng. He wanted to escape with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Can you escape?&#x201D;</p><p>However, Sun Feiyang did not give the two of them the opportunity to escape. A boundlessly oppressive might came crushing down from the sky. It pressed Chu Feng and Wang Qiang to the ground like two dying dogs.</p><p>&#x201C;Chu Feng, there&#x2019;s no one capable of saving you now.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;However, rest assured. No matter what, you are still a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. Thus, I will not kill you. I will merely cripple your cultivation.&#x201D;</p><p>Sun Feiyang walked over to Chu Feng with a smile on his face. He held his Royal Armament ax high up and waved his arm. Following that, a ray of light came hacking down at Chu Feng&#x2019;s waist.</p><p>How could this be considered to be crippling Chu Feng&#x2019;s cultivation? He was simply trying to hack Chu Feng in two.</p><p>&#x201C;Are you certain that there&#x2019;s no one capable of saving Chu Feng?&#x201D;</p><p>However, who would&#x2019;ve thought that, right at this moment of imminent peril, an aged voice suddenly sounded. Following that, the space before Chu Feng trembled, and an aged palm appeared before him.</p><p>Although that palm was withered and thin, it contained a boundless amount of power. Firmly, it grabbed onto Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s Royal Armament ax and blocked Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s attack.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s you?&#x201D; At this moment, even Sun Feiyang&#x2019;s mouth was wide open. The expression on his face took a huge change. He immediately released the Royal Armament ax in his hand and took a step back.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
