<p><strong> Chapter 2128 - Reviving The Chu Family </strong></p><p>Although Chu Feng&#x2019;s return came as an enormous surprise to all the people in the Misty Peak, Chu Feng did not plan to stay for long.</p><p>He had merely brought Xian Miaomiao and the others to have a look at the Stairway to Heaven, and greeted Qiushui Fuyan and Huangfu Haoyue. He casually told them that Xian Miaomiao and the others might have to use the Stairway to Heaven in the future, and requested that they not try to stop them from doing so.</p><p>He also told them about his main purpose in returning to the Eastern Sea Region that time around.</p><p>After finding out that Chu Feng had returned to the Eastern Sea Region with the intent to return to the Nine Provinces Continent to revive his relatives, and that he would be leaving immediately after doing so, Huangfu Haoyue and the others decided to accompany Chu Feng to the Nine Provinces Continent.</p><p>Although they did not possess any understanding of the Outer World, they were able to realize that Chu Feng would likely be leaving for a very long time.</p><p>As such, they all wished to accompany Chu Feng in the limited time that they had.</p><p>Thus, the number of people in Chu Feng&#x2019;s group grew even more numerous and powerful.</p><p>Majestically, they began to proceed toward the Nine Provinces Continent.</p><p>&#x201C;I truly never would&#x2019;ve thought that Chu Feng would&#x2019;ve&#x2026; already become this powerful in merely a few short years.&#x201D;</p><p>As Huangfu Haoyue, Qiushui Fuyan and the others looked to Chu Feng, who was at the front of the group of people, their gazes became very complicated.</p><p>The reason for that was because, on their way to the Nine Provinces Continent, Xian Miaomiao, Sima Ying, Princess Lingyue and other members of the younger generation from the Holy Land of Martialism had all arrived before Huangfu Haoyue and the others, this group of people from the Eastern Sea Region.</p><p>The reason why they went to them was because they wished to know more about Chu Feng&#x2019;s achievements in the Eastern Sea Region from Huangfu Haoyue and the others.</p><p>However, at the same time as they were making inquiries about Chu Feng&#x2019;s past achievements, they were also informing Huangfu Haoyue and the others about what Chu Feng had accomplished in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>Thus, Huangfu Haoyue and the others already knew of Chu Feng&#x2019;s true strength now, as well as the status he possessed in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p><p>They began to recall how Chu Feng had been so weak, how he had truly been someone from the younger generation, and how he had still needed them to protect him before.</p><p>And now, Chu Feng had become so powerful. He had reached a level they were simply unable to even touch.</p><p>At that moment, exclamations of admiration filled their hearts.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re here.&#x201D;</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng, who was leading the crowd, stopped.</p><p>The reason for that was because they had arrived at the Nine Provinces Continent&#x2019;s Azure Province. Furthermore, they were currently in the skies above the Golden-purple City.</p><p>Although the Golden-purple City was not the hometown of the Chu Family, it was the place where the people from the Chu Family had been massacred.</p><p>If Chu Feng wanted to resurrect them, this would be the best place to do so.</p><p>&#x201C;Seniors, please wait for me here. I will return immediately.&#x201D;</p><p>Then, Chu Feng personally proceeded toward the Azure Dragon School.</p><p>He was going there to call for the people of the Chu Family.</p><p>He was not doing this for the sake of telling them this great news immediately. Rather, the resurrection secret technique possessed a very important characteristic. That was that it required one&#x2019;s close kin to call for the souls of the dead.</p><p>Back then, a lot of people from the Chu Family had been killed. Among them, many were not close to Chu Feng at all.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that if he wanted to resurrect more people from the Chu Family, he would need more people from the Chu Family that possessed close relationships with those that had been killed.</p><p>As such, Chu Guyu, Chu Wei, Chu Cheng, Chu Zhen, Chu Yue and the others, the people from the Chu Family that were still alive, would all be absolutely necessary for this.</p><p>Chu Feng arrived at the Azure Dragon School and directly told Chu Guyu and the others from the Chu Family why he had returned.</p><p>After hearing about this technique, Chu Guyu and the others were all filled with astonishment; they all felt an enormous amount of disbelief.</p><p>After all, resurrection was something that they&#x2019;d never seen before, something simply unheard of.</p><p>Even though they found it unbelievable, and found it hard to accept that there would be such a technique in the world, they still decided to follow Chu Feng.</p><p>As such, they all arrived at the Golden-purple City.</p><p>It was not only the people from the Chu Family that followed him over, the Azure Dragon Founder, Li Zhangqing, Zhuge Liuyun and others also followed him over.</p><p>&#x201C;Heavens! This&#x2026;&#x201D;</p><p>When the Azure Dragon Founder, Chu Guyu and the others saw all the experts from the Holy Land of Martialism, they were all stunned.</p><p>The difference between their cultivations was simply too great. Even though the experts from the Holy Land of Martialism did not deliberately reveal their auras, and were even deliberately concealing them, they still appeared to emit extraordinary airs before the eyes of Chu Guyu and the others.</p><p>This caused Chu Guyu and the others to feel as if they were little grasses standing before enormous mountains when they stood before the Elf King and the others. They felt themselves to be extremely small.</p><p>&#x201C;Little brother Chu Feng, those people&#x2026; they&#x2019;re all your friends from the Holy Land of Martialism?&#x201D; Astonished, Chu Yue asked Chu Feng curiously. She began to feel that her little brother was even more amazing than she had thought.</p><p>&#x201C;We are all Chu Feng&#x2019;s friends,&#x201D; The Elf King said with a smile. Seemingly afraid that the people from the Azure Dragon School would be afraid, his tone was extremely gentle and friendly.</p><p>Following him, the other people also expressed their close relationship with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;Ssss~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After telling the crowd of their relationship with Chu Feng, the people from the Azure Dragon School were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p><p>Even though they already knew that Chu Feng&#x2019;s future outlook was very bright, they had not expected Chu Feng to be this overwhelmingly powerful.</p><p>At that moment they were astonished, so astonished that they all turned their gazes to Chu Feng, with pride filling their gazes.</p><p>After all, they were all people who had close relationships with Chu Feng.</p><p>&#x201C;B-B-B-Beauty, n-ni-nice to meet you. I-I am C-C-Chu Feng&#x2019;s g-good friend. M-My name is W-Wang Qiang.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;M-May I a-ask, a-are you Chu F-Feng&#x2019;s big s-sister?&#x201D;</p><p>Right at that moment, Wang Qiang&#x2019;s body shifted. Like a phantom, he arrived before Chu Yue.</p><p>Although Wang Qiang&#x2019;s upper body was completely naked, and he possessed an extremely strange outfit, his strength was extremely powerful. As such, Chu Yue did not dare to disrespect him. She answered truthfully, &#x201C;Senior, nice to meet you. I am Chu Feng&#x2019;s older cousin. My name is Chu Yue.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;M-my, d-don&#x2019;t address me a-as s-s-senior. I m-might even be y-younger than you. C-Come, let&#x2019;s s-s-s-sh-shake hands,&#x201D; Wang Qiang extended his filthy and stinky hand with a beaming smile on his face.</p><p>To Chu Yue, Wang Qiang was a senior. When he was asking for a handshake, how could she possibly dare to refuse him?</p><p>Merely, she did not notice that Wang Qiang&#x2019;s saliva was about to drool out of the corner of his mouth the moment she extended her lily-white hand.</p><p>&#x201C;Paa~~~&#x201D;</p><p>Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately raised his hand and slapped Wang Qiang&#x2019;s extended hand away. Then he shouted, &#x201C;Scram! You&#x2019;re even trying to take advantage of my big sister Chu Yue? Have you grown tired of living?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;N-N-Nonesense! A-Am I t-t-that sort of p-per-person?&#x201D; Wang Qiang spoke with righteousness. Then his body shifted, and he arrived before Chu Xue. With a beaming smile on his face, he said, &#x201C;N-N-Nice to meet you. I-I a-am Chu F-Feng&#x2019;s friend. M-May I k-know who y-you m-might be?&#x201D;</p><p>Sigh&#x2026;</p><p>Seeing Wang Qiang acting like this, Chu Feng revealed an expression of helplessness. Thus, he decided to ignore Wang Qiang. He turned to Chu Guyu and the others and said, &#x201C;Big brother, big sister Chu Yue, let&#x2019;s start.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Little brother, is it truly possible?&#x201D; Chu Guyu asked.</p><p>Chu Guyu did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to resurrect the people of the Chu Family. However, at the same time, he truly wished for that resurrection technique to be true.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s give it a try,&#x201D; Chu Feng said with a light smile. His smile was slightly distressed.</p><p>The reason for that was because even he was uncertain as to whether or not it was truly possible. That said, he also deeply wished for that secret technique to be useful.</p><p>Thus, Chu Feng was very scared that the secret technique would fail; that he would not be able to resurrect the members of the Chu Family.</p><p>&#x201C;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&#x201D;</p><p>After thinking about it, Chu Feng immediately started to set up a grand formation. For the sake of preventing a failure, Chu Feng was extremely meticulous in setting up this grand formation. He would make sure to grasp everything and every detail of the formation.</p><p>After the formation was completed, Chu Feng and the others from the Chu Family all sat cross-legged above the formation&#x2019;s core.</p><p>After they all entered the formation, everyone closed their eyes. What they had to do was very simple. They merely needed to emit their longing for their relatives and call for their relatives in their hearts nonstop. As for the rest&#x2026; that would all be left to Chu Feng to take care of.</p><p>Suddenly, Chu Feng shouted, &#x201C;Rise.&#x201D;</p><p>Once he said that word, the fifty-five thousand five hundred and fifty-five white candles within the formation were simultaneously ignited.</p><p>At the same time, a strange sort of power began to pulse from the formation.</p><p>&#x201C;That secret technique!!!&#x201D;</p><p>At that moment, everyone&#x2019;s hearts, regardless of whether they were from the Holy Land of Martialism or the Eastern Sea Region, started to tighten, And their expressions changed.</p><p>When the candles ignited, they all sensed that strange power engulfing their bodies.</p><p>That was a power that they had never felt before. It was as if their souls were attracted to that formation.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><strong>Please support the translation through my <a href="www.patreon.com">patreon</a> if you are able to.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be early access to future chapters :).</strong></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
