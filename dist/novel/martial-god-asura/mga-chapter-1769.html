<p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1769 - Grand Benefactor</strong></p><p>&#x201C;This disciple pays his respects to Elder Chang and all the other elders,&#x201D; Immediately, Big Radish and Little Radish hurriedly greeted them respectfully. As disciples of the Underworld Palace, the two of them appeared to be extremely reserved before those people.</p><p>Especially Little Radish. While he was not scared upon seeing Chu Feng, when he saw these elders, he began to tremble with fear.</p><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no need to be overly courteous,&#x201D; The leading elder waved his hand. Then, with a beaming smile, he looked to Chu Feng, clasped his fist and said, &#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, I am Chang Ping. It is my pleasure to meet little friend Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Chang Ping is being too courteous. It is Chu Feng&#x2019;s fortune to be able to meet all you seniors,&#x201D; Chu Feng responded courteously. Chu Feng had a pretty good impression of this Underworld Palace&#x2019;s elder. Although he was someone from the Underworld Palace, his actions earlier had been very righteous.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Chang, I believe you should know who I am worried about. Although they are inferior to your Underworld Palace, they still possess power that cannot be looked down upon in the Holy Land of Martialism. Are you certain that you&#x2019;ll be able to protect them?&#x201D; Chu Feng pointed at Big Radish and Little Radish.</p><p>Elder Chang patted his chest as he guaranteed, &#x201C;Regarding that, little friend Chu Feng can rest assured. If our Underworld Palace lacked even that bit of ability, our reputation would be utterly undeserved.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Although the three of them are only ordinary disciples of our Underworld Palace, we will still absolutely not allow outsiders to bully and humiliate them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;This time around, a lot of experts from our Underworld Palace have arrived. Merely, they are all located outside of the fort.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While we do not dare to say that we are unparalleled within the fort, if we are to leave the fort, there will definitely not be anyone who dares to touch a single person from our Underworld Palace.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The reputation of the Underworld Palace is truly well-deserved,&#x201D; Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled a relieved smile. The capabilities of the Underworld Palace were extremely grand. Thus, Chu Feng naturally believed that the Underworld Palace possessed the ability to protect Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish.</p><p>Merely, having the ability did not necessarily mean that they would definitely protect them. After all, this elder had also said that Chili Pepper and the others were only ordinary disciples.</p><p>However, regardless of what status and position this elder held in the Underworld Palace, since he dared to publicly make a guarantee to Chu Feng like he had, and speak those words while representing the Underworld Palace, the Underworld Palace would definitely not allow Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish to be touched by the Four Great Imperial Clans. Else, the ones who would be humiliated would be the Underworld Palace.</p><p>&#x201C;Little friend Chu Feng, we must still thank you for helping us today. Else, I&#x2019;m afraid that we would all have died at the hands of that Zhan Qiankun today.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Senior Chang is flattering me. What happened today was not that serious,&#x201D; Chu Feng said modestly.</p><p>&#x201C;My, I wasn&#x2019;t being courteous. Rather, it is that serious. Little friend Chu Feng, you do not have to continue being so modest. Today, all of us who are able to live all owe you a favor.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The grace you&#x2019;ve shown us is not something that can be thanked with words. Thus, I will not bother with saying too many decorous words. To express my thanks, I wish to offer a cup of wine to little friend Chu Feng,&#x201D; Elder Chang waved his hand and invited Chu Feng with a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Senior, Chu Feng appreciates your kind intentions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Merely, I have not seen my brother Yan Xie for a long time. To see him again here, I have a lot of things I wish to talk with him about. As time is very urgent, I&#x2019;m afraid that I will have to decline the invitation to drink with senior Chang today. If the opportunity presents itself another day, Chu Feng will definitely drink with senior until we&#x2019;re both drunk,&#x201D; Chu Feng refused that Underworld Palace&#x2019;s elder&#x2019;s invitation with a smile.</p><p>Hearing those words, Big Radish and Little Radish&#x2019;s expressions changed immediately. The two of them were extremely shocked.</p><p>Although this Elder Chang was only a low level elder in the Underworld Palace, it remained that this Elder Chang was an elder of the Underworld Palace. To disciples like them, Elder Chang was someone that they could not afford to offend.</p><p>Furthermore, it just so happened that this Elder Chang was in charge of Big Radish and the others. Thus, they knew very well what sort of temperament this Elder Chang had. His temperament was extremely violent. Practically none of this group of disciples dared to offend him.</p><p>Yet, Chu Feng had actually refused Elder Chang&#x2019;s invitation in front of all these people. The way they saw it, Chu Feng would have most definitely offended Elder Chang.</p><p>&#x201C;Haha, very well. If the chance presents itself again in the future, we shall gather to drink. Today, I will not disturb little friend Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>However, Elder Chang was actually not at all angered by Chu Feng&#x2019;s refusal. Instead, he laughed and then left.</p><p>To see Elder Chang, who was generally extremely arrogant, acting this peaceful before Chu Feng, Big Radish and Little Radish finally realized the principle of might makes right.</p><p>It was not that Elder Chang was a difficult person to get along with. Rather, it was that they had yet to reach a level where they could get along with Elder Chang.</p><p>As long as one possessed sufficient strength, this Elder Chang who acted like a fiend would not only be amiable, he would also be very sensible.</p><p>&#x201C;This place is not suitable to talk. Brother Yan Xie, let&#x2019;s go and talk in the house,&#x201D; As Chu Feng spoke, he brought Yan Xie and walked into world spirit building that Chili Pepper had set up.</p><p>Seeing that Chu Feng and Yan Xie were walking in, the shy Chili Pepper immediately hid herself in her own room.</p><p>Seeing Chili Pepper acting like this, Chu Feng smiled slightly. This girl was much more interesting than he had imagined her to be.</p><p>Earlier, she had been extremely fiery, and appeared to be completely fearless. Even when facing death, she had no fear. Yet, at this moment, she was actually acting this timidly.</p><p>&#x201C;Big brother Chu Feng, I do not understand why you refused Elder Chang&#x2019;s invitation,&#x201D; After entering the room, Little Radish asked with an expression of confusion.</p><p>&#x201C;If I were to go with him, he would definitely invite you and your brother. With how reserved the two of you are before that Elder Chang, even if you were to join us after being invited, you would not be able to enjoy the event. Thus, it is better that I refuse the invitation,&#x201D; Chu Feng said.</p><p>Hearing those words, both Big Radish and Little Radish were stunned. They had truly never expected that Chu Feng had refused Elder Chang because of them. All of a sudden, a burst of warmth surged through their bodies. The two of them also began to reveal smiles of satisfaction on their faces.</p><p>&#x201C;Here, take these. They&#x2019;re my gifts,&#x201D; Chu Feng took out some cultivation resources and many rare treasures from his Cosmos Sack and handed them to Big Radish and Little Radish.</p><p>Throughout his journey, Chu Feng had obtained a lot of treasures. Merely, a lot of those treasures were useless to him. However, those treasures would be extremely useful to Big Radish and Little Radish.</p><p>In fact, Chu Feng had obtained quite a lot of treasures from Zhan Qiankun, Jin Wei&#x2019;e, Yin Wei&#x2019;e and Tong Wei&#x2019;e&#x2019;s Cosmos Sacks. In fact, there were even four Incomplete Imperial Armaments. Although, other than Zhan Qiankun&#x2019;s Black Flame Whip, the other three were all copies, it still remained that they were Incomplete Imperial Armaments.</p><p>Merely, those things were, after all, the possessions of the Evildoers&#x2019; disciples. While it would be fine for Chu Feng to keep them himself, he could not give them to others. If he did, they would likely bring about disaster to Big Radish and Little Radish.</p><p>After all, the notorious Great Evildoers were different from the Four Great Imperial Clans. No matter what, the Four Great Imperial Clans had to consider their clans when they did things.</p><p>However, the Great Evildoers were mavericks who did not have to worry about anything. When they did things, they would act extremely crazily.</p><p>In fact, Chu Feng&#x2019;s killing of the Four Great Evildoers&#x2019; personal disciples had left behind an enormous danger. If the Four Great Evildoers were to find out about this, they would definitely not let Chu Feng get away with it.</p><p>Merely, the situation today had been extremely critical. Chu Feng had had no choice but to kill them. The reason for that was because even if he were to release them, they would not let him get away.</p><p>Furthermore, they had the intention to kill Chu Feng&#x2019;s friends. As such, Chu Feng would absolutely not put up with it. He definitely had to kill them.</p><p>&#x201C;No, these are too precious. We cannot accept them,&#x201D; However, after seeing the gifts Chu Feng had presented to them, Big Radish and Little Radish immediately refused them.</p><p>&#x201C;If you two consider me to be your friend, then accept them. Otherwise, do not say that you know me from today on,&#x201D; Chu Feng forced the treasures into Big Radish and Little Radish&#x2019;s bosoms.</p><p>&#x201C;This&#x2026;&#x201D; Big Radish and Little Radish were at a loss as for what to do.</p><p>&#x201C;Just accept them. Those things are useless to Chu Feng. However, they&#x2019;re extremely useful for you two. This is Chu Feng&#x2019;s kind intentions. The two of you should stop refusing them,&#x201D; Yan Xie urged.</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, in that case, thank you, brother Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Hehe, thank you, big brother Chu Feng.&#x201D;</p><p>After being urged by Yan Xie, the two of them finally accepted Chu Feng&#x2019;s gifts. Then, they cautiously put those treasures away. After they put the treasures away, the two of them were grinning from ear to ear, unable to conceal their happiness.</p><p>They had refused earlier only because they found it embarrassing to accept them. The reason for that was because they knew that those items Chu Feng was giving them were truly precious. They were so unimaginably precious to them. Even if they were to put forth all of their family fortune, they would not be able to afford treasures like those.</p><p>However, the two of them actually wanted those treasures extremely badly. After all, it was as Yan Xie said, those treasures were extremely useful to them.</p><p>If it wasn&#x2019;t for Chu Feng giving those treasures to them, they might not be able to find treasures like those in their entire lives.</p><p>Thus, the two of them were extremely grateful and thankful toward Chu Feng. At the same time, they felt that they were extremely fortunate. Chu Feng was simply a grand person, their grand benefactor.</p><p></p><hr><p></p>
