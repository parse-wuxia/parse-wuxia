<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 969 - An Attack akin to a Natural Disaster</strong></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;ANCESTOR&#x2014;&#x201D; The expression of the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s members turned ashen. They were completely stupefied, unable to come back to their senses until a brief moment later, which they began to heart-wrenchingly lament.</span></p><p><span style="">Murong Mingtian was simply too important to them. In their hearts, he was akin to a god&#x2014;one that led them and one that ruled over the world.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet now, their god was killed. How could they accept such an outcome? Like a believer who lost their faith, they lost a direction in life.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;We will avenge Ancestor&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Amidst such devastating sorrow, the Immortal Execution Archipelago felt their rage and woe merge. They started pouncing towards the Crippling Night Demon Sect in a complete disregard for their own lives. They started trading deaths and paid no heed to what they did so long as they killed.</span></p><p><span style="">However, though power arose from their blend of emotions, the Crippling Night Demon Sect too rose in might after seeing Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s death. They weren&#x2019;t scared by the suicidal Immortal Execution Archipelago, and instead, they began even more ruthless slaughters.</span></p><p><span style="">In a situation like that, it was very difficult for the already suppressed Immortal Execution Archipelago and Three Great Monstrous Clans to hold on.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This feeling&#x2026; Could it be&#x2026;?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">However, after Murong Mingtian&#x2019;s body exploded, there was a faint power that poured into Chu Feng&#x2019;s body. However, Chu Feng frowned after it entered. A hint of suspicion flashed into his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">*aoo&#x2014;* In Chu Feng&#x2019;s moment of distraction, Jiang Qisha took that chance to cast his Mortal Taboo martial skill. He wanted to pass Chu Feng&#x2019;s White Tiger Slaughtering Technique and launch a sneak attack as well.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom&#x2014;* However, he had greatly underestimated the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique. Even though Chu Feng hadn&#x2019;t been focusing completely, the Secret Skill still had its own will. It once again broke Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s Mortal Taboo martial skill.</span></p><p><span style="">*aoo&#x2014;* The white tiger then let out a furious roar, and leapt towards Jiang Qisha.</span></p><p><span style="">*whoosh* Jiang Qisha started quickly flying backwards in the air. He didn&#x2019;t choose to continue releasing Mortal Taboo martial skills to forcefully meet Chu Feng&#x2019;s attack. He instead chose to escape.</span></p><p><span style="">But the white tiger kept chasing tenaciously and it was very quick. Even though Jiang Qisha had used a bodily martial skill, the distance separating the two continued to gradually shrink.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Is this real? The genius who comes from the Holy Land of Martialism, and even defeated a Divine Body, is being forced to flee because of Chu Feng?&#x201D; The observers were exclaiming endlessly at such a sight.</span></p><p><span style="">If the act of killing Murong Mingtian made them acknowledge Chu Feng&#x2019;s strength, then the act of Jiang Qisha forced to flee in such a pitiful state by Chu Feng&#x2019;s Secret Skill made them approve of Chu Feng&#x2019;s abilities, as, after all, everyone knew Jiang Qisha was much more powerful than Murong Mingtian.</span></p><p><span style="">So even though Chu Feng had suppressed Jiang Qisha, many people still held in their hearts a sliver of hope. They felt the genius Jiang Qisha was unfathomable. There existed an infinite number of possibilities on him, so Chu Feng might not truly defeat him.</span></p><p><span style="">But many people&#x2019;s sliver of hope had started to break. The situation before their eyes did not make it appear that Jiang Qisha had a trump card to deal with Chu Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph.&#x201D; But just when many people thought Jiang Qisha was defeated already, he coldly snorted as a hint of resolution surfaced in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">He then flipped his palm and several Talismanic Pellets appeared on his hand. He opened his mouth and swallowed them all.</span></p><p><span style="">*hmm*</span></p><p><span style="">After consuming the pellets, Jiang Qisha had the same reaction as Murong Mingtian: runes and patterns appeared on his skin and his aura soared.</span></p><p><span style="">*bang* Jiang Qisha suddenly turned around and punched the incoming White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom* That fist was not to be underestimated. It simply contained the power to destroy this land, and that punch alone blew apart Chu Feng&#x2019;s White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;So powerful&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;As expected of a genius from the Holy Land of Martialism. It seems that </span><i><span style="">this</span></i><span style=""> is his real strength.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;This is too horrifying. Has he finally brought out his true abilities? It seems that Chu Feng&#x2019;s going to have something heading his way!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Many people deeply gasped at the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique dissipating in the air. At the same time, many people who wished for Chu Feng&#x2019;s death had an eased smile on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Heavens! Jiang Qisha is this terrifying! How will Chu Feng stop him?&#x201D; As for those who wished Chu Feng to live, they couldn&#x2019;t help but worry about him.</span></p><p><span style="">Regardless how much power remained in the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, it was still a powerful ability that could destroy Mortal Taboo martial skills.</span></p><p><span style="">Yet, at this moment, Jiang Qisha had broken through it with his fist. That illustrated Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s current strength. At least, his former self was not even comparable to him right now.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chu Feng, the number of people who can force me to this state are countable by my fingers even within the Cursed Soil Sect.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I admit. I, Jiang Qisha, have underestimated you. I underestimated the strength that would come out of a bumpkin like you. However, it&#x2019;s time for this to end. I&#x2019;ll let you see what a true genius is! I&#x2019;ll let you see what a true technique is!&#x201D; Jiang Qisha sneered as he looked at Chu Feng, then his expression changed and he released an explosive shout.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;DIE&#x2014;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">He struck with his fist, palm, foot, and leg, all at the same time. Four fierce bursts of Martial power rushed out from those four places.</span></p><p><span style="">The strength those four bursts of power contained was very fierce. Typical martial skills simply could not compare to them; it was even several times stronger than the Mortal Taboo martial skill Jiang Qisha used before.</span></p><p><span style="">He was now not only casting four martial skills at the same time, he was casting four different Mortal Taboo martial skills at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="">*boom*</span></p><p><span style="">Then, they merged together in the air, and became a body of energy that enveloped the sky.</span></p><p><span style="">The body of energy traveled through the air. It was like an enormous wave as it surged forward, yet also like a horrifying black mass of clouds. It not only had four different colours, it brought with it lightning and a storm. It was akin to an apocalypse that would destroy the world.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;My gods! Jiang Qisha has actually cast such a terrifying technique! Is this still a martial skill? Is this still a technique of a human? This is simply more like the work of a god!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">As they gazed upon the body of energy covering the entire sky and surging towards Chu Feng, everyone was stunned. Regardless if they wished for Chu Feng&#x2019;s death, they were dumbfounded by Jiang Qisha&#x2019;s move. This was most definitely the strongest technique they had seen up until now. It was simply a natural disaster that could destroy everything!</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
