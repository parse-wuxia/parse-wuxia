<p><strong>MGA: Chapter 695 - Wuqing Has Died?</strong></p><p><span style="">The Misty Peak consisted of countless peaks; however, most of them were forbidden regions. Even people from the Misty Peak could not step into those lands without permission.</span></p><p><span style="">The peak that led to the Martial Marking Immortal Realm was one of them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, at present, the peak was not a forbidden area. Rather, quite a few people had congregated at that location.</span></p><p><span style="">It was all because of the opening of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. The people who gathered at that place were companions of the geniuses who entered the realm&#x2014;the experts of the older generation.</span></p><p><span style="">There was still a day to the closing of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, so many of the senior experts atop the peak sat on the ground cross-legged, resting with eyes closed. The place did seem quite serene.</span></p><p><span style="">However, an event that had just occurred made the entire peak lively. Everyone wore stunned expressions, some even had curiosity and confusion filled in their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="">It was because just now, three geniuses from the Immortal Execution Archipelago crushed their Immortal Talismans, sending them back from the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.</span></p><p><span style="">Such a change attracted everyone&#x2019;s attention. One had to know that the preset time to leave the Martial Marking Immortal Realm had yet to arrive. At a time like this, it should be when they put their all into obtaining Martial Markings. Who would, for no reason at all, crush their Immortal Talisman in advance?</span></p><p><span style="">Besides, their faces were even full of fear, as though they were horrified by something.</span></p><p><span style="">So, the people inferred that they might have encountered peril so were thus forced to crush their Immortal Talismans and return. However, what sort of person could make the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago escape, and what sort of person dared to make a move on the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago?</span></p><p><span style="">As they crowd were guessing this and that, very soon three more people appeared. It was even more impressive that time, as they were the three peak geniuses of the Immortal Execution Archipelago whose name resounded throughout the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p><p><span style="">One of the three great beauties of the Eastern Sea Region, the granddaughter of the head of the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s Nine Immortals, Ya Fei.</span></p><p><span style="">Daughter of the master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, the sister of the Eastern Sea Region&#x2019;s number one genius, Murong Xun, Murong Wan.</span></p><p><span style="">As well as the son of the Immortal Execution Archipelago&#x2019;s Second Immortal, Zhan Jiuxiao, Zhan Feng.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Why have these three geniuses appeared as well?&#x201D; At that instant, discussions arose within the people. Everyone was making guesses.</span></p><p><span style="">After all, when the three geniuses from before appeared, perhaps there existed some sort of reasonable excuse; though they were strong, they were not the strongest. However, at that instant, the three others were different.</span></p><p><span style="">It would be fair to say that those there were the strongest of those who entered the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. Who could threaten the three of them? That truly made everyone imaginations drift about, yet no result could be concluded.</span></p><p><span style="">But just as the people atop the peak were throwing guesses about, something they did not anticipate at all was four more people appearing on the peak. Unexpectedly, they were the four disciples of Lady Piaomiao, </span><i><span style="">the Four Seasons</span></i><span style="">.</span></p><p><span style="">This time, the entire mountain peak exploded. What the hell was happening? Why have the several strongest people in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm come out? What exactly happened?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Ya Fei, Zhan Feng, Murong Wan! You three are truly shameless, contemptible, and of extreme low-class! You can&#x2019;t fight with fair battles, so you use despicable methods. Do you even want face?&#x201D; After Chun Wu came out, she was instantly enraged. She pointed at Ya Fei and the others and cursed fiercely.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chun Wu, although I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re saying, I advise you to pay heed to your words. If you dare to slander me like that again, careful&#x2026; as I might not hold myself back against you.&#x201D; Ya Fei did not back down, and instead, threatened Chun Wu, as if she were the one who wronged her.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? You&#x2019;re not admitting it? Or do you not dare? From what I see, you fear embarrassment, right?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Fine. You fear embarrassment, so that&#x2019;s exactly what I will give you. You don&#x2019;t want to let others know of the things that happened in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, so I will let them know exactly that.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">When Ya Fei and the others actually did not admit to the actions they committed, Chun Wu curled her lips, then looked at the crowd and loudly said, &#x201C;Seniors. The six geniuses of the Immortal Execution Archipelago simply reach the extremities of despicableness and shamelessness. In the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, for fighting over benefits, they can be said to have used up all possible loathsome methods&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">After that, Chun Wu detailedly told&#x2014;especially everything that happened within the Temple of Reproduction&#x2014;the crowd about the matters that happened within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Huaa~~~~~~&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">And after Chun Wu finished narrating, the people on scene were simply so shocked that they couldn&#x2019;t be more shocked. Putting aside the things Ya Fei, Zhan Feng, Murong Wan, and the others from the Immortal Execution Archipelago did, a small character like Wuqing not only opened the Temple of Reproduction from the legends, he even defeated&#x2014;with his own strength&#x2014;the three peak geniuses from the Immortal Execution Archipelago. That was simply unimaginable.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;That isn&#x2019;t true, is it? How is that possible?&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah! Even if that Wuqing brat obtained benefits in the Temple of Reproduction, he only has the cultivation of a rank three Martial Lord. How could he defeat Ya Fei, Zhan Feng, and Murong Wan?&#x201D; Due to the fact that it was too inconceivable, many people did not easily believe Chun Wu&#x2019;s words, and expressed doubt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Chun Wu, although I don&#x2019;t know how we offended you, do you not feel ashamed by &#x2018;spewing out lies like a river flowing&#x2019;, and &#x2018;spraying blood upon a person and calling it murder&#x2019;?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;I admit, we indeed entered the Temple of Reproduction at the same time as you, but the things you said are simply not true.&#x201D; Ya Fei firmly denied the charges, not admitting to anything. How could she possibly admit to the actions performed in the Temple of Reproduction?</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Yeah! Lady Chun Wu, you have such a beautiful appearance, but I didn&#x2019;t expect your heart to be akin to vipers and scorpions. That Temple of Reproduction clearly exploded on its own. How could you frame us and say it was we who did something?&#x201D; Zhan Feng refuted as well.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. You can argue quite well. Indeed, all of you are shameless.&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">Chun Wu&#x2019;s face reddened from anger. The six of them would absolutely deny the accusations, and the words the four of them said might not be believed by outsiders. If they did not admit anything no matter what, she truly could do nothing to them.</span></p><p><span style="">However, she, who originally had the chance to obtain large amounts of Martial Markings, because of Ya Fei and the others&#x2019; actions, lost such a rare chance. Naturally, she was very bitter. So, even if they were not willing to admit it, she had to uncover everything.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Chun Wu, don&#x2019;t argue anymore. Up until now, Junior Wuqing still hasn&#x2019;t come out yet!&#x201D; But just at that moment, Qiu Zhu secretly pulled Chun Wu&#x2019;s skirt.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;What? Junior Wuqing hasn&#x2019;t come out yet?!&#x201D; Hearing those words, Chun Wu was instantly shocked. Her originally flush-red face immediately turned pale. Especially when she was looking around her, and even sent out her Spirit power to scan the entire mountain peak, yet could not even find Chu Feng&#x2019;s shadow, she was terrified there and then.</span></p><p><span style="">Because it meant that Chu Feng hadn&#x2019;t been able to escape the Temple of Reproduction. At that very instant, he was very possibly buried within.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Dammit.&#x201D; Only after being shocked for quite a while did Chun Wu react. She pointed at Ya Fei and the others and cursed, &#x201C;If anything happens to Junior Wuqing, I will not be done with you.&#x201D; After speaking, Chun Wu rose into the sky, and flew down the peak.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Junior Chun Wu, wait for me!&#x201D; Seeing that Qiu Zhu hurriedly followed.</span></p><p><span style="">&#x201C;Hmph. Has he died? Well deserved!&#x201D;</span></p><p><span style="">At that instant, Xia Yu and Dong Xue gazed at one another. Not only was there not the slightest trace of worry or panic on their faces, they even felt hiddenly refreshed. They, who had been in a poor relationship with Chu Feng, truly wished Chu Feng died in the Temple of Reproduction. With that, not only could the hatred in their hearts be resolved, they would have even removed a potential great enemy.</span></p><p><span style="">But being hiddenly refreshed was being hiddenly refreshed. They still had to put on an act on the surface, so after knowing that Chun Wu and Qiu Zhu went for Lady Piaomiao for help, they did not stop and also leaped, chasing after them.</span></p><p></p><hr><p></p>
