<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p><p>The second month, the twenty-third.</p><p>Luoyang.</p><p>Blowing snow filled the sky.</p><p>Sima Chaoqun wore a wide bamboo hat and a felt cloak. He whipped his horse to charge faster through the winter&#x2019;s last snowstorm, charging from Luoyang toward Chang&#x2019;an.</p><p>He knew that Zhu Meng was most likely already in Chang&#x2019;an.</p><p>The Great Protection Agency&#x2019;s power was abundant, but too widely dispersed. Most of its top-rate talent was comprised of various Jianghu bosses, most of whom would not readily leave their bases of operation to travel to Chang&#x2019;an.</p><p>The men Zhu Meng had led to Chang&#x2019;an were soldiers prepared to die, each one worth more than ten men, with no intention of returning to Luoyang alive.</p><p>Zhuo Donglai would realize this, and wouldn&#x2019;t enter into an open battle.</p><p>But he would have a plan to deal with Zhu Meng, and his plan would certainly be extremely effective.</p><p>Deceitful, ruthless, contemptible, but extremely effective.</p><p>No one understood Zhuo Donglai better than Sima Chaoqun.</p><p>He wanted to get back as quickly as possible, and prevent Zhuo Donglai from doing something he would regret for his entire life.</p><p>He had climbed high enough, and felt extremely tired.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t want to have to climb over Zhu Meng&#x2019;s carcass to get to the next level.</p><p>What method would Zhuo Donglai use to deal with Zhu Meng and Little Gao?</p><p>Sima Chaoqun didn&#x2019;t know, and hadn&#x2019;t thought about it. Fluttering snowflakes filled the sky like countless dancing butterflies.</p><p>His heart suddenly sank, because he knew what Zhuo Donglai planned to do.</p><p><strong>Part 2</strong></p><p>The same day, Chang&#x2019;an.</p><p>Chang&#x2019;an Restaurant.</p><p>The first pavilion of Chang&#x2019;an Restaurant, amidst sheets of cold, fragrant plum blossoms.</p><p>No fire burned in the building, as it was improper. To admire plum blossoms requires cold. The colder, the more fragrant; the colder, the more elegant.</p><p>This was something that could only be understood by a person who wears marten coats and drinks fine wines and has never felt the bite of hunger and cold. People who didn&#x2019;t eat well and couldn&#x2019;t dress warmly would never understand.</p><p>&#x201C;I never thought the two gentlemen would arrive earlier than me.&#x201D;</p><p>When Zhuo Donglai entered the pavilion, Zhu Meng and Little Gao were already seated, and had already finished half a jug of wine.</p><p>&#x201C;Stick your head out, there&#x2019;s a blade waiting. Tuck your head in, there&#x2019;s also a blade waiting. We decided to come, so why not come early? Freaking drink some of the free wine and have a good time.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Of course. Clan Leader Zhu is correct, arriving early is better.&#x201D; Zhuo Donglai smiled. &#x201C;The earlier you arrive, the more there is to see.&#x201D; One by one, he opened all the windows. &#x201C;Other than the plum blossoms, what else did the Clan Leader see?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I saw a huge pile of dog shit. I&#x2019;m not sure which stray mutt shitted it out.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhuo Donglai&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change, and he didn&#x2019;t appear to be upset.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not too sure, either,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But I can guarantee that the mutt wasn&#x2019;t sent by me to ambush you, and wasn&#x2019;t a member of the Great Protection Agency.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How do you know it wasn&#x2019;t from the Great Protection Agency?&#x201D; Zhu Meng laughed coldly. &#x201C;Did you ask it? Did you have a discussion with it?&#x201D;</p><p>Zhuo Donglai was still wearing a smile.</p><p>&#x201C;Some things don&#x2019;t need to be asked,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;For example, the pile of dog shit that Clan Leader Zhu saw, we know it was a dog who shitted it out, so there&#x2019;s no need to ask the shit if it came from a dog, because neither dogs nor dog shit can speak.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhu Meng laughed heartily.</p><p>&#x201C;Well said, well said. I can&#x2019;t measure up to someone as low down you.&#x201D; He laughed and raised his cup. &#x201C;I can only drink with you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I can accompany you.&#x201D; Zhuo Donglai raised his cup and then drained it. &#x201C;But, there&#x2019;s something both you and I understand in our hearts.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Leader Zhu&#x2019;s willingness to accept my invitation here was not because he wished to have a few drinks with me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Oh?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Clan Leader Zhu came because he wants to see what trick Zhuo Donglai has up his sleeve.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhu Meng laughed. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re right again. You&#x2019;re completely freaking correct.&#x201D;</p><p>His laughter suddenly ceased. His bloodshot eyes shot forth an expression as hard as lightning. &#x201C;What trick do you have up your sleeve?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Actually, I don&#x2019;t have any trick. Even if I did, the person to play the trick isn&#x2019;t me.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If it&#x2019;s not you, then who is it?&#x201D;</p><p>Zhuo Donglai poured another cup and took a sip. Then, in his unique one-word-at-a-time way of speaking said, &#x201C;I invited Clan Leader Zhu here tonight because someone is going to perform a dance for the king.&#x201D;</p><p>The expression on Zhu Meng&#x2019;s face flickered.</p><p>What feeling was he experiencing in his heart at this moment?</p><p>No one could imagine, and no one could describe it. The scraping of a blade, the stabbing of a needle, the burning of a fire; none of these could sufficiently describe the feeling.</p><p>Zhuo Donglai raised his glass to Little Gao.</p><p>&#x201C;Die Wu&#x2019;s dancing ranks best under heaven. It&#x2019;s something not many people are able to see. You and me have a great privilege tonight.&#x201D;</p><p>Little Gao didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>Zhuo Donglai laughed. &#x201C;Although, what I invited Brother Gao here tonight to see is not a dance.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;What did you invite me here to see?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;A person.&#x201D; Zhuo Donglai spoke one word at a time. &#x201C;A person that Brother Gao very much wants to see.&#x201D;</p><p>Little Gao&#x2019;s expression also flickered.</p><p>&#x2014;A woman whose name he didn&#x2019;t know, and a relationship that could never be forgotten.</p><p>Zhuo Donglai gave a carefree laugh. &#x201C;It seems Brother Gao has already guessed who I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201D;</p><p>There was a crack as the wine cup in Little Gao&#x2019;s hand shattered. Fragments of the cup stabbed into his palm.</p><p>Zhu Meng suddenly growled like a tiger, his hand shot out, the veins protruding. He grabbed Zhuo Donglai&#x2019;s jacket. &#x201C;Where is she? And where is this other person you&#x2019;re talking about?&#x201D;</p><p>Zhuo Donglai didn&#x2019;t move at all. He looked coldly at Zhu Meng&#x2019;s hand and waited until it released his jacket. Then he slowly said, &#x201C;The person I&#x2019;m talking about will arrive at any moment.&#x201D;</p><p>It seemed his words were directed at Zhu Meng, and yet his eyes were fixed on Little Gao.</p><p><strong>Part 3</strong></p><p>At that moment, a glittering black carriage came to a halt in front of Chang&#x2019;an Restaurant.</p><p>The faint sound of a stringed instrument could be heard from within the nearby trees. The music was beautiful, the accompanying lyrics sang of the vicissitudes of life, and were filled with a sort of helpless sorrow.</p><p>&#x201C;Spring comes and spring goes, the flowers bloom and the flowers fall; when it comes time to part, who can remain behind?&#x201D;</p><p>Die Wu sat mutely in the carriage, listening. In the wind, a dead, withered leaf fluttered out of nowhere like a butterfly, before landing lightly onto the snowy ground.</p><p>After pushing open the carriage door and stepping out, she picked up the leaf and stared at it dumbly, for a long time.</p><p>A drop of water fell down out of nowhere and landed on the leaf. It was impossible to tell whether it was a teardrop or a raindrop. It looked just like a dewdrop on a freshly bloomed flower petal in the middle of spring.</p><p><strong>Part 4</strong></p><p>Frigid wind filled the fragrant pavilion. Zhu Meng loosened the front of his jacket more. It seemed as if he wanted the cold wind to stab into his heart.</p><p>Neither he nor Little Gao said a word. Their throats had been stopped up by a sweet, strong, sour, bitter feeling.</p><p>A grizzled, white-haired blind man walked up into the pavilion, using a bamboo pole to tap the ground in front of him.</p><p>A little girl, her long hair tied in a braid, grasped the old man&#x2019;s robe and walked along with him.</p><p>The old man carried a bamboo flute, and the young girl held a pipa. It seemed they were to provide musical accompaniment for Die Wu&#x2019;s dance. Even though the old man&#x2019;s wrinkled face was expressionless, it seemed as if every wrinkle were a tomb that contained countless sufferings and sorrows.</p><p>The world has too many sorrows.</p><p>The little girl saw nothing, because she was blind. Blind from birth, she had never seen light, and had never experienced the joy of youth.</p><p>Two people like this, how could they play music filled with happiness and joy?</p><p>The old man walked in quietly and sat in the corner where he usually sat.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t his first time here, and every time he came, he played sad songs.</p><p>When you play sad songs for people who usually laugh a lot, the sound of the music can arouse their hidden sorrow.</p><p>Some people want this.</p><p>&#x2014;People really are strange creatures. Sometimes they view sorrow and suffering as something to enjoy.</p><p>From downstairs could be heard more footsteps.</p><p>They were quick and light and distinct.</p><p>As soon as he heard the footsteps, Little Gao swept past the table toward the staircase and rushed down.</p><p>Zhu Meng didn&#x2019;t move at all.</p><p>His body seemed stiff, as stiff as the corpse of a rock, a corpse that had been dead for countless ages.</p><p>&#x2014;A woman with an unknown name, and a relationship that could never be forgotten.</p><p>Little Gao had thought he would never see her again, and yet here she was in front of him.</p><p>&#x2014;Was it a dream?</p><p>She saw him, too.</p><p>She stared at him dumbly. Was she surprised? Happy? Did she want to run to meet him? Or did she want to run away?</p><p>Little Gao didn&#x2019;t give her a chance to decide.</p><p>He rushed forward and took hold of her, grasping her hands.</p><p>This was no dream, and no illusion.</p><p>His hands were filled with a feeling of rich warmth, as was his heart.</p><p>&#x201C;Why did you leave that day? Where did you go? Why are you here?&#x201D;</p><p>Little Gao didn&#x2019;t ask any of these questions.</p><p>As long as they could see each other, those things weren&#x2019;t important.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re here, you&#x2019;re really here. This time I won&#x2019;t let you leave.&#x201D;</p><p>He pulled her back up the stairs, his eyes fixed on her face.</p><p>And then suddenly, her face suddenly changed, filled with a look of horror.</p><p>Her pupils suddenly contracted in terror, and then widened. It seemed like her body would collapse.</p><p>&#x2014;What had she seen?</p><p>Little Gao looked at her in shock, and he was about to turn around to see what she was looking at.</p><p>But then, his face was also filled with a look of horror, as if he had seen something extraordinarily terrible. A long time passed. And then he finally dared to look back.</p><p>He turned his head, and looked at Zhu Meng.</p><p>The look on Zhu Meng&#x2019;s face was like that of a wild beast. A wild beast who had fallen into the trap of the hunter, heart-broken, furious, and hopeless. The person he was looking at was the same person Little Gao had pulled up the stairs.</p><p>Die Wu.</p><p>And in that instant, Little Gao suddenly understood everything.</p><p>Die Wu.</p><p>This woman, who he had found so enchanting, and felt he would never be able to forget, was Zhu Meng&#x2019;s enchanting, unforgettable Die Wu.</p><p>&#x2014;How could fate be so cruel!</p><p>But this was not fate, and it was not coincidence. Not by any means.</p><p>Zhuo Donglai looked at them, his eyes filled with the laughter of an evil god watching simple humans make sacrifices at his altar.</p><p>Freezing hands.</p><p>Everyone&#x2019;s hands were freezing.</p><p>Little Gao let go of Die Wu&#x2019;s freezing hands, and started walking backwards. He kept walking until he reached a corner.</p><p>Zhu Meng&#x2019;s stared at his face, and his bloodshot eyes seemed to have transformed into spears.</p><p>Spears dripping with blood.</p><p>Little Gao died.</p><p>Even though his body didn&#x2019;t die, that bloody spear had pierced his heart.</p><p>But this death was not a release.</p><p>&#x2014;What would Zhu Meng do to him? What should he do to Zhu Meng?</p><p>Little Gao didn&#x2019;t dare think about it, and couldn&#x2019;t. He wasn&#x2019;t able to think.</p><p>The only thing he could do was leave.</p><p>Who would have thought that just as he was about to leave, a voice would suddenly say, &#x201C;Wait a moment.&#x201D;</p><p>Little Gao was shocked to find that Die Wu had recovered her composure, and was suddenly unafraid to face him.</p><p>&#x201C;I know you want to leave, that you feel you must leave,&#x201D; said Die Wu. &#x201C;But you need to wait a moment before you go.&#x201D;</p><p>Composed and resolute, her eyes radiated a power that it seemed no person could resist.</p><p>Only when someone is afraid of nothing can they summon this kind of power.</p><p>Die Wu turned to face Zhu Meng. &#x201C;I remember you once said that when I dance, no one is allowed to go.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhu Meng&#x2019;s fists were clenched, as if he wanted to grab the world and crush it to pieces, destroy everything.</p><p>Zhuo Donglai laughed. He smiled eerily at Die Wu and said, &#x201C;You can still dance?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Have you ever seen the silkworms in spring?&#x201D; she answered. &#x201C;As long as they are not dead, they will continue to spin silk. I&#x2019;m the same. As long as I&#x2019;m still alive, I can dance.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhuo Donglai clapped his hands together. &#x201C;Well then, that&#x2019;s excellent!&#x201D;</p><p>The fox-fur cloak fell, the dancing garments fluttered.</p><p>The white-haired musician, who had been sitting quietly in the corner, stood up. His wan, tired faced looked like a piece of yellow, wrinkled paper.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m blind, old and blind,&#x201D; he said slowly. &#x201C;My heart has long since been empty of any happiness. So, I always play sad songs for the great men here. But today, I want to make an exception.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You want to play a happy song for us?&#x201D; asked Zhuo Donglai.</p><p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Did you think of something happy today?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No? Then why do you want to make an exception today?&#x201D;</p><p>The white-haired musician stared off into the darkness with his two unseeing eyes. His voice was hoarse and sad. &#x201C;Even though I&#x2019;m blind, old and blind, I can still sense that there is too much heartbreak here today.&#x201D;</p><p>There was a twang as the pipa sounded out. The old man&#x2019;s first note sounded as if it were played on a silk string that could move the soul. The single silk string transformed into countless silk strings; the pipa&#x2019;s music sounded like pearls falling on a plate of jade.</p><p>Every string of silk, every pearl, was graceful and joyous. What he played today was definitely not a song of helpless sorrow.</p><p>What he played was a song of the joy of life.</p><p>Die Wu danced.</p><p>Her dancing was also filled with joy, as if she had forgotten all of the sorrow in her life.</p><p>Her life and her dance had been fused together.</p><p>Because all she had left in her life was dance.</p><p>Because she was a dancer.</p><p>In this instance, she was no longer the person who had experienced the sorrows of life, a suffering woman. Instead, she was a dancer; noble, pure and beautiful.</p><p>In her dance appeared her happiness and youth, and in her dance, her happiness and youth also faded away.</p><p>&#x201C;The treasured sword is ruthless, Zhuangzi dreams no dreams;</p><p>Dance for the king, transform into a butterfly.&#x201D;</p><p>The old man playing the pipa suddenly began to weep.</p><p>He played a joyful tune, yet tears filled his empty eyes.</p><p>He could not see the people in the room, but he could sense them.</p><p>&#x2014;Such sorrowful people, such darkness.</p><p>His happy tune could only make sorrow more sorrowful. It was as if his joyous melody had transformed into a type of ridicule.</p><p>There was a &#x201C;pa&#x201D; sound as one of the pipa strings broke.</p><p>The dance was also broken.</p><p>Die Wu fell down like a leaf at Zhuo Donglai&#x2019;s feet. And suddenly, from within Zhuo Donglai&#x2019;s bootleg she pulled out a dagger.</p><p>The short dagger glittered like a gem.</p><p>She raised her head and looked at Zhu Meng, then she turned and looked at Little Gao.</p><p>The dagger in her hand had descended, descended toward her knees.</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>As soon as the dagger descended, blood splattered.</p><p>Underneath the blade of the dagger, her legs had become like two rotten logs.</p><p>After the dagger descended, she was no longer a dancer. There are no dancers in the world with severed legs.</p><p>Such beautiful legs, so lithe, so nimble, so beautiful.</p>
